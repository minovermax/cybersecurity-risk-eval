RISK FACTORS\nOn February 21, 2021, Exelon\u2019s Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Utility Registrants and Generation, creating two publicly traded companies. The separation was completed on February 1, 2022. See Note 26 - Separation of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. As such, the risk factors discussed below do not include those associated with Generation.\nEach of the Registrants operates in a complex market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond that Registrant\u2019s direct control. Such risks, which could negatively affect one or more of the Registrants\u2019 consolidated financial statements, fall primarily under the categories below:\nRisks related to market and financial factors primarily include:\n\u2022the demand for electricity, reliability of service, and affordability in the markets where the Utility Registrants conduct their business,\n\u2022the ability of the Utility Registrants to operate their respective transmission and distribution assets, their ability to access capital markets, and the impacts on their results of operations due to the global outbreak (pandemic) of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), and\n\u2022emerging technologies and business models, including those related to climate change mitigation and transition to a low carbon economy.\nRisks related to legislative, regulatory, and legal factors primarily include changes to, and compliance with, the laws and regulations that govern:\n\u2022utility regulatory business models,\n\u2022environmental and climate policy, and\n\u2022tax policy.\nRisks related to operational factors primarily include:\n\u2022changes in the global climate could produce extreme weather events, which could put the Registrant\u2019s facilities at risk, and such changes could also affect the levels and patterns of demand for energy and related services,\n\u2022the ability of the Utility Registrants to maintain the reliability, resiliency, and safety of their energy delivery systems, which could affect their ability to deliver energy to their customers and affect their operating costs, and\n\u2022physical and cyber security risks for the Utility Registrants as the owner-operators of transmission and distribution facilities.\nRisks related to the separation primarily include:\n\u2022challenges to achieving the benefits of separation and\n\u2022performance by Exelon and Generation under the transaction agreements, including indemnification responsibilities.\nThere may be further risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be material that could negatively affect the Registrants' consolidated financial statements in the future.\nRisks Related to Market and Financial Factors\nThe Registrants are potentially affected by emerging technologies that could over time affect or transform the energy industry (All Registrants).\nAdvancements in power generation technology, including commercial and residential solar generation installations and commercial micro turbine installations, are improving the cost-effectiveness of customer self-supply of electricity. Improvements in energy storage technology, including batteries and fuel cells, could also better position customers to meet their around-the-clock electricity requirements. Improvements in energy efficiency of lighting, appliances, equipment and building materials will also affect energy consumption by customers. Changes in power generation, storage, and use technologies could have significant effects on customer behaviors and their energy consumption.\nThese developments could affect levels of customer-owned generation, customer expectations, and current business models and make portions of the Utility Registrants' transmission and/or distribution facilities uneconomic prior to the end of their useful lives. These factors could affect the Registrants\u2019 consolidated financial statements through, among other things, increased operating and maintenance expenses, increased capital\nexpenditures, and potential asset impairment charges or accelerated depreciation over shortened remaining asset useful lives.\nMarket performance and other factors could decrease the value of employee benefit plan assets and could increase the related employee benefit plan obligations, which then could require significant additional funding (All Registrants).\nDisruptions in the capital markets and their actual or perceived effects on particular businesses and the greater economy could adversely affect the value of the investments held within Exelon\u2019s employee benefit plan trusts. The asset values are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which could fall below Exelon's projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the pension and OPEB plan assets would increase the funding requirements associated with Exelon\u2019s pension and OPEB plan obligations. Additionally, Exelon\u2019s pension and OPEB plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit costs and funding requirements. Changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions or changes to Social Security or Medicare eligibility requirements could also increase the costs and funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and OPEB plans. See Note 15 - Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe Registrants could be negatively affected by unstable capital and credit markets (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as the banking and commercial paper markets, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets in the United States or abroad could negatively affect the Registrants\u2019 ability to access the capital markets or draw on their respective bank revolving credit facilities. The banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to the Registrants if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time. The inability to access capital markets or credit facilities, and longer-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could result in the deferral of discretionary capital expenditures, or require a reduction in dividend payments or other discretionary uses of cash. In addition, the Registrants have exposure to worldwide financial markets, including Europe, Canada, and Asia. Disruptions in these markets could reduce or restrict the Registrants\u2019 ability to secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable terms. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 20%, 17%, and 16% of the Registrants\u2019 available credit facilities (not including Generation's credit facilities) were with European, Canadian, and Asian banks, respectively. See Note 17 - Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the credit facilities.\nIf any of the Registrants were to experience a downgrade in its credit ratings to below investment grade or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standards in its agreements with its counterparties or regulatory financial requirements, it would be required to provide significant amounts of collateral that could affect its liquidity and could experience higher borrowing costs (All Registrants).\nThe Utility Registrants' operating agreements with PJM and PECO's, BGE's, and DPL's natural gas procurement contracts contain collateral provisions that are affected by their credit rating and market prices. If certain wholesale market conditions were to exist and the Utility Registrants were to lose their investment grade credit ratings (based on their senior unsecured debt ratings), they would be required to provide collateral in the forms of letters of credit or cash, which could have a material adverse effect upon their remaining sources of liquidity. PJM collateral posting requirements will generally increase as market prices rise and decrease as market prices fall. Collateral posting requirements for PECO, BGE, and DPL, with respect to their natural gas supply contracts, will generally increase as forward market prices fall and decrease as forward market prices rise. If the Utility Registrants were downgraded, they could experience higher borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade. In addition, changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have an adverse negative impact on the ratings of the Utility Registrants.\nThe Utility Registrants conduct their respective businesses and operate under governance models and other arrangements and procedures intended to assure that the Utility Registrants are treated as separate,\nindependent companies, distinct from Exelon and other Exelon subsidiaries in order to isolate the Utility Registrants from Exelon and other Exelon subsidiaries in the event of financial difficulty at Exelon or another Exelon subsidiary. These measures (commonly referred to as \u201cring-fencing\u201d) could help avoid or limit a downgrade in the credit ratings of the Utility Registrants in the event of a reduction in the credit rating of Exelon. Despite these ring-fencing measures, the credit ratings of the Utility Registrants could remain linked, to some degree, to the credit ratings of Exelon. Consequently, a reduction in the credit rating of Exelon could result in a reduction of the credit rating of some or all of the Utility Registrants. A reduction in the credit rating of a Utility Registrant could have a material adverse effect on the Utility Registrant.\nSee ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Matters - Market Conditions and Security Ratings for additional information regarding the potential impacts of credit downgrades on the Registrants\u2019 cash flows.\nThe impacts of significant economic downturns or increases in customer rates, could lead to decreased volumes delivered and increased expense for uncollectible customer balances (All Registrants).\nThe impacts of significant economic downturns on the Utility Registrants' customers and the related regulatory limitations on residential service terminations for the Utility Registrants, could result in an increase in the number of uncollectible customer balances and related expense. Further, increases in customer rates, including those related to increases in purchased power and natural gas prices, could result in declines in customer usage and lower revenues for the Utility Registrants that do not have decoupling mechanisms.\nSee ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK for additional information on the Registrants\u2019 credit risk.\nThe Registrants' results were negatively affected by the impacts of COVID-19 (All Registrants).\nCOVID-19 has disrupted economic activity in the Registrants\u2019 respective markets and negatively affected the Registrants\u2019 results of operations. The estimated impact of COVID-19 to the Utility Registrants\u2019 Net income was approximately $75 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and was not material for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Registrants cannot predict the full extent of the impacts of COVID-19, which will depend on, among other things, the rate, and public perceptions of the effectiveness, of vaccinations and rate of resumption of business activity. In addition, any future widespread pandemic or other local or global health issue could adversely affect customer demand and the Registrants\u2019 ability to operate their transmission and distribution assets. See Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Executive Overview for additional information.\nThe Registrants could be negatively affected by the impacts of weather (All Registrants).\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities. Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. Moderate temperatures adversely affect the usage of energy and resulting operating revenues at PECO and DPL Delaware. Due to revenue decoupling, operating revenues from electric distribution at ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL Maryland, and ACE are not affected by abnormal weather.\nExtreme weather conditions or damage resulting from storms could stress the Utility Registrants' transmission and distribution systems, communication systems, and technology, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs and limiting each company\u2019s ability to meet peak customer demand. First and third quarter financial results, in particular, are substantially dependent on weather conditions, and could make period comparisons less relevant.\nClimate change projections suggest increases to summer temperature and humidity trends, as well as more erratic precipitation and storm patterns over the long-term in the areas where the Utility Registrants have transmission and distribution assets. The frequency in which weather conditions emerge outside the current expected climate norms could contribute to weather-related impacts discussed above.\nLong-lived assets, goodwill, and other assets could become impaired (All Registrants).\nLong-lived assets represent the single largest asset class on the Registrants\u2019 statements of financial position. In addition, Exelon, ComEd, and PHI have material goodwill balances.\nThe Registrants evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used whenever events or circumstances indicating a potential impairment exist. Factors such as, but not limited to, the business climate, including current and future energy and market conditions, environmental regulation, and the condition of assets are considered.\nComEd and PHI perform an assessment for possible impairment of their goodwill at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting units below their carrying amount. Regulatory actions or changes in significant assumptions, including discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for ComEd\u2019s, Pepco\u2019s, DPL\u2019s, and ACE\u2019s business, and the fair value of debt, could potentially result in future impairments of Exelon\u2019s, ComEd's, and PHI\u2019s goodwill.\nAn impairment would require the Registrants to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset or goodwill to fair value through a non-cash charge to expense by the amount of the impairment. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Note 8 - Property, Plant, and Equipment, Note 12 - Asset Impairments and Note 13 - Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on long-lived asset impairments and goodwill impairments.\nThe Registrants could incur substantial costs in the event of non-performance by third-parties under indemnification agreements, or when the Registrants have guaranteed their performance (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants have entered into various agreements with counterparties that require those counterparties to reimburse a Registrant and hold it harmless against specified obligations and claims. To the extent that any of these counterparties are affected by deterioration in their creditworthiness or the agreements are otherwise determined to be unenforceable, the affected Registrant could be held responsible for the obligations. Each of the Utility Registrants has transferred its former generation business to a third party and in each case the transferee has agreed to assume certain obligations and to indemnify the applicable Utility Registrant for such obligations. In connection with the restructurings under which ComEd, PECO, and BGE transferred their generating assets to Generation, Generation assumed certain of ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s, and BGE's rights and obligations with respect to their former generation businesses. Further, ComEd, PECO, and BGE have entered into agreements with third parties under which the third-party agreed to indemnify ComEd, PECO, or BGE for certain obligations related to their respective former generation businesses that have been assumed by Generation as part of the restructuring. If the third-party, Generation, or the transferee of Pepco's, DPL's, or ACE\u2019s generation facilities experienced events that reduced its creditworthiness or the indemnity arrangement became unenforceable, the applicable Utility Registrant could be liable for any existing or future claims. In addition, the Utility Registrants have residual liability under certain laws in connection with their former generation facilities.\nThe Registrants have issued indemnities to third parties regarding environmental or other matters in connection with purchases and sales of assets, including several of the Utility Registrants in connection with Generation's absorption of their former generating assets. The Registrants could incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations under these indemnities.\nThe Registrants have issued guarantees of the performance of third parties, which obligate the Registrants to perform in the event that the third parties do not perform. In the event of non-performance by those third parties, the Registrants could incur substantial cost to fulfill their obligations under these guarantees.\nRisks Related to Legislative, Regulatory, and Legal Factors\nThe Registrants' businesses are highly regulated and could be negatively affected by legislative and/or regulatory actions (All Registrants).\nSubstantial aspects of the Registrants' businesses are subject to comprehensive Federal or state legislation and/or regulation.\nThe Utility Registrants' consolidated financial statements are heavily dependent on the ability of the Utility Registrants to recover their costs for the retail purchase and distribution of power and natural gas to their customers.\nFundamental changes in regulations or adverse legislative actions affecting the Registrants\u2019 businesses would require changes in their business planning models and operations. The Registrants cannot predict when or whether legislative or regulatory proposals could become law or what their effect would be on the Registrants.\nChanges in the Utility Registrants' respective terms and conditions of service, including their respective rates, are subject to regulatory approval proceedings and/or negotiated settlements that are at times contentious, lengthy, and subject to appeal, which lead to uncertainty as to the ultimate result and which could introduce time delays in effectuating rate changes (All Registrants).\nThe Utility Registrants are required to engage in regulatory approval proceedings as a part of the process of establishing the terms and rates for their respective services. These proceedings typically involve multiple parties, including governmental bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups, and various consumers of energy, who have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates. Decisions are subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with the approval proceedings. The potential duration of such proceedings creates a risk that rates ultimately approved by the applicable regulatory body may not be sufficient for a Utility Registrant to recover its costs by the time the rates become effective. Established rates are also subject to subsequent prudency reviews by state regulators, whereby various portions of rates could be adjusted, subject to refund or disallowed, including recovery mechanisms for costs associated with the procurement of electricity or gas, credit losses, MGP remediation, smart grid infrastructure, and energy efficiency and demand response programs. In certain instances, the Utility Registrants could agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters, customer initiatives, or franchise agreements. These settlements are subject to regulatory approval. The ultimate outcome and timing of regulatory rate proceedings have a significant effect on the ability of the Utility Registrants to recover their costs or earn an adequate return. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe Registrants could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards, including the likely exposure of the Utility Registrants to the results of PJM\u2019s RTEP and NERC compliance requirements (All Registrants).\nThe Utility Registrants as users, owners, and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by NERC and enforced by FERC. PECO, BGE, and DPL, as operators of natural gas distribution systems, are also subject to mandatory reliability standards of the U.S. Department of Transportation. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles. Compliance with or changes in the reliability standards could subject the Registrants to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures. In addition, the ICC, PAPUC, MDPSC, DCPSC, DEPSC, and NJBPU impose certain distribution reliability standards on the Utility Registrants. If the Utility Registrants were found in non-compliance with the Federal and state mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to remediation costs as well as sanctions, which could include substantial monetary penalties.\nThe Registrants could incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulation and legislation by local, state, and Federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Registrants conduct their operations and make capital expenditures including how they handle air and water emissions, hazardous and solid waste, and activities affecting surface waters, groundwater, and aquatic and other species. Violations of these requirements could subject the Registrants to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs for remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties and exposure to third parties\u2019 claims for alleged health or property damages, or operating restrictions to achieve compliance. In addition, the Registrants are subject to liability under these laws for the remediation costs for environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by the Registrants and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generated or released. Remediation activities associated with MGP operations conducted by predecessor companies are one component of such costs. Also, the Registrants are currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and could be subject to additional proceedings in the future. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS - Environmental Matters and Regulation for additional information.\nThe Registrants could be negatively affected by federal and state RPS and/or energy conservation legislation, along with energy conservation by customers (All Registrants).\nChanges to current state legislation or the development of Federal legislation that requires the use of clean, renewable, and alternate fuel sources could significantly impact the Utility Registrants, especially if timely cost recovery is not allowed.\nFederal and state legislation mandating the implementation of energy conservation programs that require the implementation of new technologies, such as smart meters and smart grid, could increase capital expenditures and could significantly impact the Utility Registrants consolidated financial statements if timely cost recovery is not allowed. These energy conservation programs, regulated energy consumption reduction targets, and new energy consumption technologies could cause declines in customer energy consumption and lead to a decline in the Registrants' revenues. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS - Environmental Matters and Regulation - Renewable and Clean Energy Standards and \"The Registrants are potentially affected by emerging technologies that could over time affect or transform the energy industry\" above for additional information.\nThe Registrants could be negatively affected by challenges to tax positions taken, tax law changes, and the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions. (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants are required to make judgments in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes and ongoing appeal issues related to these tax matters. These judgments include reserves established for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken that could be subject to challenge by the tax authorities. See Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies and Note 14 - Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLegal proceedings could result in a negative outcome, which the Registrants cannot predict (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising out of their business operations. The material ones are summarized in Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures, result in lost revenue, or restrict existing business activities.\nThe Registrants could be subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make them vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or other consequences (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants could be the subject of public criticism. Adverse publicity of this nature could render public service commissions and other regulatory and legislative authorities less likely to view energy companies in a favorable light, and could cause those companies, including the Registrants, to be susceptible to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes, as well as increased regulatory oversight and more stringent legislative or regulatory requirements.\nExelon and ComEd have received requests for information related to an SEC investigation into their lobbying activities. The outcome of the investigations could have a material adverse effect on their reputation and consolidated financial statements (Exelon and ComEd).\nOn October 22, 2019, the SEC notified Exelon and ComEd that it had opened an investigation into their lobbying activities in the state of Illinois. Exelon and ComEd have cooperated fully, including by providing all information requested by the SEC, and intend to continue to cooperate fully and expeditiously with the SEC. The outcome of the SEC\u2019s investigation cannot be predicted and could subject Exelon and ComEd to civil penalties, sanctions, or other remedial measures. Any of the foregoing, as well as the appearance of non-compliance with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, could have an adverse impact on Exelon\u2019s and ComEd\u2019s reputations or relationships with regulatory and legislative authorities, customers, and other stakeholders, as well as their consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIf ComEd violates its Deferred Prosecution Agreement announced on July 17, 2020, it could have an adverse effect on the reputation and consolidated financial statements of Exelon and ComEd (Exelon and ComEd).\nOn July 17, 2020, ComEd entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Illinois (USAO) to resolve the USAO\u2019s investigation into Exelon\u2019s and ComEd\u2019s lobbying activities in the State of Illinois. Exelon was not made a party to the DPA and the investigation by the USAO into Exelon\u2019s activities ended with no charges being brought against Exelon. Under the DPA, the USAO filed a single charge alleging that ComEd improperly gave and offered to give jobs, vendor subcontracts, and payments associated with those jobs and subcontracts for the benefit of the Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives and the Speaker\u2019s associates, with the intent to influence the Speaker\u2019s action regarding legislation affecting ComEd\u2019s interests. The DPA provides that the USAO will defer any prosecution of such charge and any other criminal or civil case against ComEd in connection with the matters identified therein for a three-year period subject to certain obligations of ComEd, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) payment to the United States Treasury of $200 million; (ii) continued full cooperation with the government\u2019s investigation; and (iii) ComEd\u2019s adoption and maintenance of remedial measures involving compliance and reporting undertakings as specified in the DPA. If ComEd is found to have breached the terms of the DPA, the USAO may elect to prosecute, or bring a civil action against, ComEd for conduct alleged in the DPA or known to the government, which could result in fines or penalties and could have an adverse impact on Exelon\u2019s and ComEd\u2019s reputation or relationships with regulatory and legislative authorities, customers and other stakeholders, as well as their consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRisks Related to Operational Factors\nThe Registrants are subject to risks associated with climate change (All Registrants).\nClimate adaptation risk refers to risks to the Registrants' facilities or operations that may result from changes in the physical climate, such as changes to temperature, weather patterns and sea level.\nThe Registrants periodically perform analyses to better understand how climate change could affect their facilities and operations. The Registrants primarily operate in the Midwest and East Coast of the United States, areas that historically have been prone to various types of severe weather events, and as such the Registrants have well-developed response and recovery programs based on these historical events. However, the Registrants\u2019 physical facilities could be placed at greater risk of damage should changes in the global climate impact temperature and weather patterns, and result in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, unprecedented levels of precipitation, sea level rise, increased surface water temperatures, and/or other effects.\nOver time, the Registrants may need to make additional investments to protect their facilities from physical climate-related risks.\nIn addition, changes to the climate may impact levels and patterns of demand for energy and related services, which could affect Registrants\u2019 operations. Over time, the Registrants may need to make additional investments to adapt to changes in operational requirements as a result of climate change.\nClimate mitigation and transition risks include changes to the energy systems as a result of new technologies, changing customer expectations and/or voluntary GHG goals, as well as local, state or federal regulatory requirements intended to reduce GHG emissions.\nThe Registrants also periodically perform analyses of potential pathways to reduce power sector and economy-wide GHG emissions to mitigate climate change. To the extent additional GHG reduction legislation and/or regulation becomes effective at the Federal and/or state levels, the Registrants could incur costs to further limit the GHG emissions from their operations or otherwise comply with applicable requirements. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS - Environmental Matters and Regulation - Climate Change and \"The Registrants are potentially affected by emerging technologies that could over time affect or transform the energy industry\" above for additional information.\nThe Utility Registrants' operating costs are affected by their ability to maintain the availability and reliability of their delivery and operational systems (All Registrants).\nFailures of the equipment or facilities used in the Utility Registrants' delivery systems could interrupt the electric transmission and electric and natural gas delivery, which could result in a loss of revenues and an increase in maintenance and capital expenditures. Equipment or facilities failures can be due to a number of factors, including natural causes such as weather or information systems failure. Specifically, if the implementation of AMI, smart grid, or other technologies in the Utility Registrants' service territory fail to perform as intended or are not successfully integrated with billing and other information systems, or if any of the financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, the Utility Registrants' financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, dependence upon automated systems could further increase the risk that operational system flaws or internal and/or external tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.\nRegulated utilities, which are required to provide service to all customers within their service territory, have generally been afforded liability protections against claims by customers relating to failure of service. Under Illinois law, however, ComEd could be required to pay damages to its customers in some circumstances involving extended outages affecting large numbers of its customers, which could be material.\nThe Registrants are subject to physical security and cybersecurity risks (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants face physical security and cybersecurity risks. Threat sources continue to seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the electric and natural gas utility industry, grid infrastructure, and other energy infrastructures, and these attacks and disruptions, both physical and cyber, are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dynamic. Continued implementation of advanced digital technologies increases the potentially unfavorable impacts of such attacks.\nA security breach of the Registrants' physical assets or information systems or those of the Registrants competitors, vendors, business partners and interconnected entities in RTOs and ISOs, or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system or result in the theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including critical infrastructure information, sensitive customer, vendor, and employee data, trading or other confidential data. The risk of these system-related events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify, and while the Registrants have been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to physical and cyber-attacks, to date none have directly experienced a material breach or disruption to its network or information systems or our operations. However, as such attacks continue to increase in sophistication and frequency, the Registrants may be unable to prevent all such attacks in the future.\nIf a significant breach were to occur, the Registrants' reputation could be negatively affected, customer confidence in the Registrants or others in the industry could be diminished, or the Registrants could be subject to\nlegal claims, loss of revenues, increased costs, or operations shutdown. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance maintained against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover losses or otherwise adequately compensate for any disruptions to business that could result.\nThe Utility Registrants' deployment of smart meters throughout their service territories could increase the risk of damage from an intentional disruption of the system by third parties.\nIn addition, new or updated security regulations or unforeseen threat sources could require changes in current measures taken by the Registrants or their business operations and could adversely affect their consolidated financial statements.\nThe Registrants\u2019 employees, contractors, customers, and the general public could be exposed to a risk of injury due to the nature of the energy industry (All Registrants).\nEmployees and contractors throughout the organization work in, and customers and the general public could be exposed to, potentially dangerous environments near the Registrants\u2019 operations. As a result, employees, contractors, customers, and the general public are at some risk for serious injury, including loss of life. These risks include gas explosions, pole strikes, and electric contact cases.\nNatural disasters, war, acts and threats of terrorism, pandemic, and other significant events could negatively impact the Registrants' results of operations, ability to raise capital and future growth (All Registrants).\nThe Utility Registrants' distribution and transmission infrastructures could be affected by natural disasters and extreme weather events, which could result in increased costs, including supply chain costs. An extreme weather event within the Utility Registrants\u2019 service areas can also directly affect their capital assets, causing disruption in service to customers due to downed wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment.\nThe impact that potential terrorist attacks could have on the industry and the Registrants is uncertain. The Registrants face a risk that their operations would be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror. Any retaliatory military strikes or sustained military campaign could affect their operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil. Furthermore, these catastrophic events could compromise the physical or cybersecurity of the Registrants' facilities, which could adversely affect the Registrants' ability to manage their businesses effectively. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, pandemic, credit crises, recession, or other factors also could result in a decline in energy consumption or interruption of fuel or the supply chain. In addition, the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased costs.\nThe Registrants could be significantly affected by the outbreak of a pandemic. Exelon has plans in place to respond to a pandemic. However, depending on the severity of a pandemic and the resulting impacts to workforce and other resource availability, the ability to operate Exelon's transmission and distribution assets could be adversely affected. See \"The Registrants' results were negatively affected by the impacts of COVID-19\" above for additional information.\nIn addition, Exelon maintains a level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices against property, casualty and cybersecurity losses subject to unforeseen occurrences or catastrophic events that could damage or destroy assets or interrupt operations. However, there can be no assurance that the amount of insurance will be adequate to address such property and casualty losses.\nThe Registrants\u2019 businesses are capital intensive, and their assets could require significant expenditures to maintain and are subject to operational failure, which could result in potential liability (All Registrants).\nThe Utility Registrants\u2019 businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in transmission and distribution infrastructure projects. Equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good utility practices, is subject to operational failure, including events that are beyond the Utility Registrants\u2019 control, and could require significant expenditures to operate efficiently. The Registrants consolidated financial statements could be negatively affected if they were unable to effectively manage their capital projects or raise the necessary capital.\nSee ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information regarding the Registrants\u2019 potential future capital expenditures.\nThe Utility Registrants' respective ability to deliver electricity, their operating costs, and their capital expenditures could be negatively impacted by transmission congestion and failures of neighboring transmission systems (All Registrants).\nDemand for electricity within the Utility Registrants' service areas could stress available transmission capacity requiring alternative routing or curtailment of electricity usage. Also, insufficient availability of electric supply to meet customer demand could jeopardize the Utility Registrants' ability to comply with reliability standards and strain customer and regulatory agency relationships. As with all utilities, potential concerns over transmission capacity or generation facility retirements could result in PJM or FERC requiring the Utility Registrants to upgrade or expand their respective transmission systems through additional capital expenditures.\nPJM\u2019s systems and operations are designed to ensure the reliable operation of the transmission grid and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities. However, service interruptions at other utilities may cause interruptions in the Utility Registrants\u2019 service areas.\nThe Registrants' performance could be negatively affected if they fail to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce (All Registrants).\nCertain events, such as the separation transaction, an employee strike, loss of employees, loss of contract resources due to a major event, and an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, could lead to operating challenges and increased costs for the Registrants. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, could arise. The Registrants are particularly affected due to the specialized knowledge required of the technical and support employees for their transmission and distribution operations.\nThe Registrants could make acquisitions or investments in new business initiatives and new markets, which may not be successful or achieve the intended financial results (All Registrants).\nThe Utility Registrants face risks associated with their regulatory-mandated initiatives, such as smart grids and utility of the future. These risks include, but are not limited to, cost recovery, regulatory concerns, cybersecurity, and obsolescence of technology. Such initiatives may not be successful.\nRisks Related to the Separation (Exelon)\nThe separation may not achieve some or all of the benefits anticipated by Exelon and, following the separation, Exelon's common stock price may underperform relative to Exelon's expectations.\nBy separating the Utility Registrants and Generation, Exelon created two publicly traded companies with the resources necessary to best serve customers and sustain long-term investment and operating excellence. The separate companies are expected to create value by having the strategic flexibility to focus on their unique customer, market and community priorities. However, the separation may not provide such results on the scope or scale that Exelon anticipates, and Exelon may not realize the anticipated benefits of the separation. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on Exelon's financial statements and its common stock price.\nIn connection with the separation into two public companies, Exelon and Generation will indemnify each other for certain liabilities. If Exelon is required to pay under these indemnities to Generation, Exelon's financial results could be negatively impacted. The Generation indemnities may not be sufficient to hold Exelon harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which Generation will be allocated responsibility, and Generation may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.\nPursuant to the separation agreement and certain other agreements between Exelon and Generation, each party will agree to indemnify the other for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. Indemnities that Exelon may be required to provide Generation are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact its business. Third parties could also seek to hold Exelon responsible for any of the liabilities that Generation has agreed to retain. Any amounts Exelon is required to pay pursuant to these indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require Exelon to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of its operating business. Further, the indemnities from Generation for Exelon's benefit may not be sufficient to protect Exelon against the full amount of such liabilities, and Generation may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations.\nMoreover, even if Exelon ultimately succeeds in recovering from Generation any amounts for which Exelon is held liable, Exelon may be temporarily required to bear these losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect Exelon's business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 23501, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "POM"}
