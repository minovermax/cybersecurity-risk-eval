These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could also be materially affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.\nIn addition, this section sets forth statements which constitute our cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as \"estimates,\" \"anticipates,\" \"projects,\" \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"believes,\" \"seeks,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"may\" and \"will\" or the negative versions thereof and similar expressions and by the context in which they are used. Such statements are based upon our current expectations and speak only as of the date made. These statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in or implied by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, the possibility of greater than anticipated operating costs, lower sales volumes, the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions or assumption of unknown liabilities in connection with acquisitions, fluctuations in\ncosts of materials and labor, costs and possible effects of union organizing or other union activities, strikes, loss of key management, uncertainties regarding any existing or newly-discovered expenses and liabilities related to environmental compliance and remediation, failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the initiation or outcome of arbitrations, litigation or governmental investigations, higher than assumed sourcing or distribution costs of products, the disruption of operations from catastrophic events, disruptions in capital markets, the liquidity of counterparties in financial transactions, changes in federal and state tax laws, economic uncertainties and the reactions of competitors in terms of price and service. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date on which they are made, except as required by law.\nAlso note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions relevant to our business. Actual results may differ from certain assumptions we have made causing actual events to vary from expected results. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.\nGeneral economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance.\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance. Increases in labor costs, including health care, minimum wages, insurance costs, higher material costs for items, such as linens, other textiles and various raw materials, higher fuel and other energy costs, higher interest rates, inflation, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of rental and direct sales and selling and administrative expenses and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIncreased competition could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national, regional and local providers. Service, product quality, design, fit, comfort, price, breadth of products offered and convenience to the customer are the primary competitive elements in these industries. If existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices, we may be required to lower prices, which could be detrimental to our operating results. Our competitors also generally compete with us for possible acquisitions, which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisitions. In addition, our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services in-house instead of outsourcing such services. These competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and operating results.\nFailure to comply with the regulations of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other state and local agencies that oversee safety compliance could adversely affect our results of operations.\nVarious federal and provincial regulations apply to our business, as do various regulations promulgated by state and local agencies. For example, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, or \"OSHA,\" establishes certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by OSHA and various record keeping, disclosure and procedural requirements. Various OSHA standards apply to our operations. Likewise, as a contractor to the United States government, various regulations promulgated by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs apply to our business. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with these various regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines by government authorities and payment of damages to private litigants, affect our ability to service our customers, result in debarment of us as a contractor to the United States government and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our operating results.\nOur operating facilities are subject to stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing the potential discharges of pollutants to the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites. The operation of our business entails risks under environmental laws and regulations. We could incur significant costs, including, without limitation, clean-up costs, fines, sanctions and claims by regulators or third parties for property damage and personal injury, as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws and regulations. As a result of violations of these laws and regulations, among other things, we could be required to reduce or cease use of certain equipment and/or limit or stop production at certain facilities. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and disrupt customer relationships.\nWe are currently involved in a limited number of legal matters at various locations related to environmental laws and regulations. As part of our ongoing operations, we also are involved in various property remediation efforts. In particular, we have four projects nearing completion, which we expect will be completed within previously established reserves. We also have\nfour other projects on which we are currently working. Historically, with respect to these projects, we have borne our costs as part of our ongoing operations. As part of these latter efforts, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we determined it was likely that the parties that are contractually obligated to remediate contamination resulting from prior use of PCE at three of our previously purchased locations would not be able to continue to meet these obligations because of their respective financial condition. These acquisitions date back to the 1970s; the most recent one was in 2007. As a result of the foregoing, we recorded a charge of $3.9 million to increase our remediation-related reserves for these projects to $4.7 million.\nIn order to determine whether any additional exposure for PCE remediation exists, we have also begun environmental assessments on an additional six sites that we acquired that had historical dry cleaning operations. With respect to these sites, while we believe costs are probable, they are not yet reasonably estimable. Therefore, beyond amounts to cover the preliminary assessments, we have not recorded any reserve for these properties. These assessments will inform our next set of actions and could reveal other environmental contamination that needs to be remediated. We expect to incur additional charges to remediate PCE contamination at these sites. Further, based on information currently available, it is possible that we may incur additional losses in excess of established reserves for other environmental matters unrelated to PCE. While such charges may be significant, we believe the likelihood that any charges will have a material adverse effect on our results of ongoing operations or financial position is remote, although the charges in any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or strategies related to these contingencies, the imposition of clean-up obligations and the discovery of alleged contamination or changes out of our control. However, these amounts are not estimable at this time. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations, including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.\nUnder environmental laws, an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials. While we regularly engage in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions, we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods, nor can we give any assurance that existing remediation projects or future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to regulatory or third-party actions, including third party suits.\nAdditionally, we must maintain compliance with various permits and licenses issued to us in connection with our operations, or we must apply for and obtain such permits and licenses. Any failure on our part to maintain such compliance or to apply for and receive such permits and licenses could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at a particular location.\nAt each reporting period, we assess our operations to determine whether the costs of resolution of legal matters or of investigation and remediation of environmental conditions are probable and can be reasonably estimated, as well as the adequacy of our reserves with respect to such costs. At June 27, 2015, our reserves for remediation-related environmental matters were approximately $4.7 million.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.\nWe rely upon sophisticated information technology systems, infrastructure, and security procedures and systems to operate our business and ensure the secure storage and transmission of information. The size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and random attack. Likewise, computer networks and the internet are, by nature, vulnerable to unauthorized access. An accidental or willful security breach could result in unauthorized access and/or use of sensitive data. Our security measures could be breached by third-party action, computer viruses, accidents, or error or misconduct by an employee or contractor. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or to sabotage computer systems, change frequently, it may be difficult to detect immediately and we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving employees, contractors and temporary staff. We have encountered threats of this type from time to time, none of which have materially impacted our operations or financial results.\nAlthough we maintain a system of information security and controls, a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation. Depending on the severity, any of these events could adversely affect our operations and financial results. In addition, if we were to experience an information security breach, we may be required to expend significant amounts to remedy, protect against, or mitigate the effect of the breach, and we may not be able to remedy the situation in a timely manner, or at all. While we have invested in protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business.\nRisks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced, and the cost of those products, could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of these products is an important factor in our financial performance. We endeavor that all of our suppliers comply with applicable laws, including, without limitation, labor and environmental laws. Our ability to secure and maintain qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner can be a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the United States. Political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial stability of suppliers, failure to meet our supplier standards, labor problems experienced by our suppliers, the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. In addition, United States and Canadian foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. Our continued compliance with the disclosure requirements relating to the sourcing of so-called conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of Congo and certain other adjoining countries as required by the Dodd-Frank Act is predicated upon the timely receipt of accurate information from suppliers, who may be unwilling or unable to provide us with the relevant information. As a result, these requirements could adversely affect our costs, the availability of materials used in our products and our relationships with customers and suppliers. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our operating results.\nFluctuations in demand for our products and services may adversely impact our financial results.\nContinued uncertainty in global economic conditions may pose a risk to the overall economy as consumers and businesses may defer purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news. This could negatively impact our customers and consequently have a negative impact on our financial performance. If demand for our products and services fluctuates as a result of economic conditions or otherwise, our revenue and operating margin could be negatively impacted. Important factors that could cause demand for our products and services to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nchanges in business and economic conditions, including downturns in specific industry segments and/or the overall economy;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market, expectations for inflation and energy prices;\n\u2022\ncompetitive pressures, including pricing pressures, from companies that have competing products and services;\n\u2022\nchanges in customer needs;\n\u2022\nchanges in our customers' employment levels, which impacts the number of users of our products and services;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions taken by our competitors; and\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our products and services.\nIf our customers' demand for our products and services decreases, our plant and manufacturing capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to record an impairment of our long-lived assets, including facilities and equipment, as well as intangible assets, which would increase our expenses. A change in demand for our products and services, and changes in our customers' needs, could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results, and, in certain cases, may reduce our revenue, increase our costs, lower our gross margin percentage, or require us to recognize impairments of our assets.\nLegal proceedings may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nFrom time to time we are party to various legal claims and proceedings, including those relating to employment and regulatory matters. Certain of these claims or proceedings or potential future proceedings, if decided adversely against us or settled by us, may result in a liability that is material to our financial condition and operating results. We discuss current lawsuits and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail under Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in Note 14, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" of \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\"\nRisks associated with our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our operating results.\nHistorically, a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions. We continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and purchase suitable operations. In addition, the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired business. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate\namount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources. Although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will discover all operational deficiencies or material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator. The failure to successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover such liabilities could adversely affect our operating results.\nIncreases in fuel, energy and commodity costs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nMotor fuel, natural gas, electricity, cotton, polyester and other commodities represent a significant cost within our business. The price of these commodities, which are required to run our vehicles and equipment and manufacture our garments, can be unpredictable and can fluctuate based on events beyond our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by oil and gas producers, war, terrorism and unrest in oil producing countries, regional production patterns, limits on refining capacities, natural disasters and environmental concerns. Increases in the cost of these commodities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to preserve positive labor relationships could adversely impact our operations and financial results.\nSignificant portions of our Canadian labor force are unionized, and a lesser portion of United States employees are unionized. While we believe that our Canadian and U.S. employee relations are good, we continue to face pressure from labor unions, and could experience increased pressure. If we do encounter pressure from labor unions, any resulting labor unrest could disrupt our business by impairing our ability to produce and deliver our products and services. In addition, significant union representation would require us to negotiate with many of our employees collectively and could adversely affect our results by restricting our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations.\nInability to attract and retain employees could adversely impact our operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain employees is important to our operations. Our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force. In the event of a labor shortage, or in the event of a change in prevailing labor and/or immigration laws, we could experience difficulty in delivering our services in a high-quality or timely manner and we could be forced to increase wages in order to attract and retain employees, which would result in higher operating costs.\nLoss of our key management or other personnel could adversely impact our business.\nOur success is dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our senior management and other key personnel. If, for any reason, one or more senior executives or key personnel were not to remain active in our company, or if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nUnexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nUnexpected events, including, without limitation, fires at facilities, security breaches, cyber attacks, natural disasters, such as hurricanes and tornados, public health emergencies, war or terrorist activities, unplanned utility outages, supply disruptions, failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws and/or regulations impacting our business, could adversely affect our operating results. These events could result in disruption of customer service, physical damage or temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities, or the temporary disruption of information systems.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. While we continue to evaluate our internal controls, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we will not be able to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent or detect fraud. This may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nFailure to execute our business plan could adversely affect our business and stock price.\nSuccessful execution of our business plan is not assured as there are several obstacles to success, including the economic environment, a competitive industry and entries by us into new markets. In addition, there can be no assurance that our efforts, if properly executed, will result in our desired outcome of improved financial performance.\nFluctuations in Canadian currency could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of our foreign revenues and operating expenses are transacted in local currencies. Therefore, our results of operations and certain receivables and payables are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.", "PERMNO": 37955, "SIC": 7200, "TIC": "GK"}
