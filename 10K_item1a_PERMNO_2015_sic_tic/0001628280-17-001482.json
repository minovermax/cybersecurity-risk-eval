{"cik": "789460", "company": "WORLD FUEL SERVICES CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe extend credit to most of our customers in connection with their purchase of fuel and services from us, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected if we are unable to collect accounts receivable.\nOur success in attracting customers has been due, in part, to our willingness to extend credit on an unsecured basis to customers as opposed to requiring prepayment, letters of credit or other forms of credit support. While no single customer represents more than 10% of our total consolidated revenue, diversification of credit risk is limited to the aviation, marine and land transportation industries within which we primarily do business.\nOur exposure to credit losses will depend on the financial condition of our customers and other macroeconomic factors beyond our control, such as deteriorating conditions in the world economy or in the industries we serve, changes in oil prices and political instability. While we actively manage our credit exposure and work to respond to both changes in our customers\u2019 financial conditions or macroeconomic events, there can be no guarantee we will be able to successfully mitigate all of these risks. Credit losses, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to adequately finance our capital requirements and fund our investments, which if not available to us would impact our ability to conduct our operations.\nWe rely on credit arrangements with banks, suppliers and other parties as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flow. Future market volatility, generally, and persistent weakness in global energy markets may adversely affect our ability to access capital and credit markets or to obtain funds at low interest rates or on other advantageous terms. If we are unable to obtain credit as and when we need it on commercially reasonable terms or at all, such as in the event there is a substantial tightening of the global credit markets, a significant increase in interest rates or a significant reduction in supplier trade credit, it could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and cash flows, as well as our future development and growth. Furthermore, if we are unable to obtain debt financing and instead raise capital through an equity issuance, existing shareholders would be diluted. Even if we are able to obtain financing, the restrictions our creditors may place on our operations or our increased interest expense and leverage could limit our ability to grow.\nFinally, our cash equivalents, principally consisting of overnight investments, bank money market accounts and bank time deposits are subject to credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk, which can be exacerbated by volatility in the capital markets. Adverse changes in this respect can result in the decline of the fair value of our cash equivalents and therefore our liquidity, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur derivatives transactions with customers, suppliers, merchants and financial institutions expose us to price and credit risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs part of our price risk management services, we offer to customers various pricing structures for the purchase of fuel, including derivatives products designed to hedge exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into fixed forward contracts with some of our counterparties under which we agree to sell or purchase certain volumes of fuel at fixed prices. In addition, we may act as a counterparty in over-the-counter swap transactions with some of our customers where the customer may be required to pay us in connection with changes in the price of fuel. Further, we may use derivatives to hedge price risks associated with our fuel inventories and purchase and sale commitments. We typically hedge our price risk in any of the foregoing types of transactions by entering into derivative instruments with large energy companies, trading houses and financial institutions, on either secured or unsecured terms.\nIf we have not required a customer to post collateral in connection with a fixed forward contract or swap transaction and there is an outstanding mark-to-market liability owing, we will have effectively extended unsecured credit to that customer. Based on the volatility of fuel prices, our counterparties may not be willing or able to fulfill their obligations to us under their fixed forward contracts or swap transactions. In such cases, we would be exposed to potential losses or costs associated with any resulting default. For example, in the event the spot market price of fuel at the time of delivery is significantly less than the fixed price of the contract with the customer, a customer could default on its purchase obligation to us and purchase the fuel at the current lower spot market rate from another supplier. Meanwhile, we may have entered into a corresponding commitment with a supplier to offer our customer specified fixed pricing or terms and would be obligated to perform our fixed price purchase obligations to such supplier. Similarly, the counterparties with whom we may hedge our price risk exposure may not be willing or able to fulfill their obligations to us under their swap transactions.\nWhile we generally attempt to structure our agreements such that we are able to recover from the non-performing counterparty, we may not always be able to recover any losses or costs we may incur as a result of such counterparty\u2019s default and may be exposed to claims for damages, penalties or other costs. While we monitor and manage credit exposures for this purpose, credit defaults may still occur and the actual recovery will depend on the financial condition of that counterparty. Accordingly, should any counterparty fail to honor its obligations under our agreements, we could sustain significant losses that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to various risks in connection with our use of derivatives which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe enter into financial derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of market price fluctuations in fuel products, to offer our customers fuel pricing alternatives to meet their needs, to manage price exposures associated with our inventories, and to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. However, our efforts to hedge our exposure to fuel price and exchange rate fluctuations could be ineffective in certain instances. For example, we hedge jet fuel prices with derivatives tied to other petroleum products that have historically been correlated to aviation jet fuel (e.g. heating oil in the United States or gasoil in Europe or Asia). If the price of aviation jet fuel at a specific location experiences a divergence to historical correlations, our attempts to mitigate price risk associated with our aviation business may not be effective. Moreover, there may be times where the change in the price of jet fuel at a specific location is disrupted (e.g. hurricanes) and is not correlated to the underlying hedges when compared to historical prices.\nWe also enter into proprietary derivative transactions, which are transactions which are not intended to hedge our own risk but rather to make a profit by capitalizing on arbitrage opportunities associated with basis, time, quality or geographic spreads related to fuel products we sell. Proprietary derivative transactions, by their nature, expose us to adverse changes in commodity prices in relation to the proprietary positions taken. Although we have established limits on such exposure, any adverse changes could result in losses. The risks we face because of proprietary positions can be exacerbated by volatility in the financial and other markets. In addition, we may fail to adequately manage our risks or could otherwise incur losses if our employees fail to comply with our policies and procedures with respect to hedging or proprietary trading by engaging, for example, in unauthorized trading activity, failing to hedge a specific price risk or failing to observe limits on exposure, which could subject us to financial losses that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFinally, the majority of our derivatives are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, and we therefore recognize changes in the fair market value of these derivatives as a component of revenue or cost of revenue (based on the underlying transaction type) in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Since the fair market value of these derivatives is marked to market at the end of each quarter, changes in the value of our derivative instruments as a result of gains or losses may cause our earnings to fluctuate from period to period.\nIf we fail to comply with laws or other government regulations applicable to our operations, we could suffer penalties or costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and other regulations in the countries in which we operate at the international, federal, state/provincial and local government levels relating to, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe transportation, handling and delivery of fuel and fuel products;\n\u2022\nthe operation of fuel storage, blending and distribution facilities;\n\u2022\nworkplace safety;\n\u2022\nfuel spillage or seepage;\n\u2022\nenvironmental protection;\n\u2022\nconsumer and data protection;\n\u2022\npayment card industry data security standards;\n\u2022\ngovernment contracting and procurement;\n\u2022\nanti-trust and competition;\n\u2022\nanti-money laundering and statutes and regulations governing the transmission of funds;\n\u2022\nregulatory reporting and licensing; and\n\u2022\nhazardous waste disposal.\nDue to the complex and technical nature of these laws and regulations, inadvertent violations may occur. If we fail to comply with these laws or regulations for any reason, we would be required to correct or implement measures to prevent a recurrence of any violations, which could increase our operating costs. If more serious violations were to occur, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties or to civil or criminal liability. In addition, compliance with existing and future laws regulating the delivery of fuel by barge, truck, vessel or railcar, fuel storage terminals and underground storage tanks that we own, lease or operate may require significant capital expenditures and increased operating and maintenance costs, particularly as we acquire business with more physical assets. For example, rail incidents in the last several years have led and are likely to continue to lead to additional governmental regulation of rail shipments of crude oil and other fuel products in Canada and the United States and to increased safety standards for the railcars that transport these products, including specifications mandating modified railcar designs, configurations, materials, and equipment. These regulations, together with the decline in crude oil prices, have caused a number of railcars to be left idle by market participants and the market for these railcars has diminished significantly causing a significant decline in their value. We lease a significant number of railcars under long-term leases and these regulations could result in higher operating costs for us, such as if we are required to pay for the modifications to railcars we lease or if such railcars are deemed obsolete and we are unable to sublease them or find an alternate use. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse affect on our operating results.\nTo the extent that we use third parties in our operations, we are also subject to the risk that we would be held accountable for the failure of these third parties to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. and various international jurisdictions. Any significant fines and costs incurred as a result of such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with U.S. or foreign tax laws or a government challenging our tax position could adversely affect our business and future operating results.\nWe are affected by various U.S. and foreign taxes, including income taxes and taxes imposed on the purchase and sale of aviation, marine and land fuel products, such as sales, excise, value added tax (\"VAT\"), energy, environmental and other taxes. From time to time, we may also benefit from special tax concessions in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have operated under a special income tax concession in Singapore since 2008 which is conditional upon our meeting certain employment and investment thresholds which, if not met in accordance with our agreement, may eliminate the benefit beginning with the first year in which the conditions are not satisfied. The income tax concession reduces the income tax rate on qualified sales and derivative gains and losses. The impact of this income tax concession decreased (increased) foreign income taxes by $2.7 million, $(7.7) million and $6.3 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The impact of the income tax concession on a diluted earnings per common share basis was $0.04 for 2016, $(0.11) for 2015 and $0.09 for 2014. Changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws, our failure to comply with such laws or the loss of tax concessions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurthermore, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings that could affect the valuation of our net deferred tax assets. Our operating results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our income tax exposures.\nFrom time to time, we are under review by the Internal Revenue Service and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved in various challenges and litigation in a number of countries, including, in particular, the U.S., Brazil and South Korea, where the amounts under controversy may be significant. We are in the process of contesting a number of these tax assessments in several administrative and legal proceedings, which are at various stages of appeal. In addition, in some jurisdictions these challenges require the posting of collateral or payment of the contested amount which may affect our flexibility in operating our business or our liquidity. If these assessments are ultimately determined adversely to us, these proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. Furthermore, any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject us to administrative, civil, and criminal remedies, including fines, penalties, disgorgement, injunctions and damage to our reputation. See notes 8 and 10 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding certain tax matters.\nFinally, we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the U.S. may result in higher effective income tax rates for the Company. Further, recent developments, including proposals to change U.S. income tax laws regarding how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, investigations by the European Commission on illegal state aid, the project by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) and other initiatives, could adversely affect our worldwide effective tax rate. With the finalization of specific actions contained within the OECD\u2019s BEPS study, many OECD countries have acknowledged their intent to implement the actions and update their local tax laws. The extent (if any) to which countries in which we operate adopt and implement these actions could have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows.\nDue to our international operations, we are subject to U.S. and international laws, including U.S. economic sanctions, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar anti-bribery laws, which can impose significant compliance costs and subject us to civil or criminal penalties for non-compliance.\nDoing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions. These regulations place restrictions on our operations, trade practices and partners and investment decisions. In particular, our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Anti Bribery Act, and economic sanction programs administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d). The FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of improperly influencing official decisions or improperly obtaining or retaining business and the U.K. Anti Bribery Act prohibits bribery both in the U.K. and internationally, as well as bribery across public and private sectors. As part of our business, we regularly deal with state owned enterprises, the employees of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA. In addition, some of the international jurisdictions in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have higher than normal levels of corruption. Our activities in these countries create the risk of improper payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or other parties acting on our behalf.\nFurthermore, international trade controls, including economic sanctions, export controls and anti-boycott regulations, are complex, restrict our business dealings with certain countries and individuals, and are constantly changing. Further restrictions may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations. From time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive OFAC administered sanctions. These business dealings currently represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenue and income and generally consist of the provision of services pursuant to licenses issued by OFAC or as otherwise permitted by applicable sanctions regulations. As a result of the above activities, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption laws and trade control regulations. Violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment.\nWe have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations. However, these policies and procedures may not effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, such a violation could also cause an event of default under our Credit Facility, which if not waived, could result in the acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness, could trigger cross defaults under other agreements to which we are a party (such as certain derivative contracts), and would impair our ability to obtain working capital advances and letters of credit. Such events could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Finally, various state and municipal governments, universities and other investors maintain prohibitions or restrictions on investments in companies that do business with sanctioned countries, which could adversely affect the market for our securities.\nIn the past, we have received administrative subpoenas from OFAC requesting information regarding our transactions in countries that are the subject of U.S. sanctions. In responding to these subpoenas, we identified a limited number of transactions that may have resulted in violations of U.S. sanctions regulations or our OFAC issued licenses. In each of these responses, we noted that the transactions identified as potential violations resulted in very small amounts of revenue to us. We routinely take actions to further strengthen our compliance-related policies and procedures. Nevertheless, should OFAC determine that any activities constituted violations of U.S. sanctions regulations, civil penalties, including fines, could be assessed against us. Additionally, in the course of its ongoing reviews, OFAC could request additional information from us, in the form of additional subpoenas or otherwise, and we intend to fully cooperate with any such additional subpoenas or requests. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any OFAC review, the total costs to be incurred in response to these reviews, the potential impact on our personnel, the effect of implementing any further measures that may be necessary to ensure full compliance with U.S. sanctions regulations or to what extent, if at all, we could be subject to fines, sanctions or other penalties.\nThird parties who fail to provide products or services to us or our customers as agreed could harm our business.\nWe purchase fuel and other products from suppliers and resell to customers. If the fuel and other products we sell fail to meet the specifications we have agreed to with customers, we could incur significant liabilities if such products cause physical damage to a vessel or aircraft or result in other losses such that a customer initiates a claim or a lawsuit for which we settle or results in a decision against us. In addition, our relationship with our customers could be adversely affected and adverse publicity about any allegations of contaminated products may negatively affect us, regardless of whether the allegations are true. Although in most cases we have recourse against our suppliers for products that fail to meet contractual specifications, such recourse cannot be assured and may be costly to enforce. For example, several of our supply agreements are with foreign entities, including foreign governments, and are governed by the laws of foreign jurisdictions. If a supplier breaches such agreement, then we may incur the additional costs of determining our rights and obligations under the agreement, under applicable foreign laws, and enforcing an agreement in a foreign jurisdiction. Any significant liability in excess of any applicable insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also use third parties to provide various services to our customers, including into plane fueling at airports, fueling of vessels in port and at sea and delivering land based fuel. The failure of these third parties to perform these services in accordance with contractual terms for any reason, such as their inability to supply specified fuel or an interruption of their business because of weather, environmental or labor difficulties or political unrest, could affect our relationships with our customers and subject us to claims and other liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur fuel storage and transportation operations have inherent risks that could negatively impact our stock price, results of operations and financial condition.\nOperating fuel storage and distribution terminals and transporting fuel products involve inherent risks including:\n\u2022\noil spills and other environmental mishaps;\n\u2022\nfires, collisions and other catastrophic disasters;\n\u2022\ninjuries and loss of life;\n\u2022\nsevere damage to and destruction of property and equipment; and\n\u2022\nloss of product and business interruption.\nDamage arising from such occurrences have in the past resulted, and may in the future result, in fines and significant third party claims. We generally maintain insurance to mitigate these types of costs, however our insurance may not be sufficient to cover the liabilities we might suffer from the occurrence of one or more of the risks described above.\nIn addition, if we are involved in a spill, leak, fire or other accident involving hazardous substances or if there are releases of fuel or fuel products we own or have custody of, our operations could be disrupted. We could also be subject to material liabilities, such as the cost of investigating and remediating contaminated properties or claims by customers, employees or others who may have been injured, or whose property may have been damaged. These liabilities, to the extent not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Some environmental laws impose strict liability, which means we could have liability without regard to whether we were negligent or at fault. Any of these occurrences, and any resulting negative media coverage, could have a material adverse effect on our stock price and on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nInformation technology failures and data security breaches, including as a result of cybersecurity attacks, could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition, subject us to increased operating costs, and expose us to litigation.\nWe rely on our computer systems and network infrastructure across our operations. Despite our implementation of security and back-up measures, all of our technology systems are vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, operational error, or other catastrophic events. Our technology systems are also subject to cybersecurity attacks including malware, other malicious software, phishing email attacks, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data, the unauthorized release, corruption or loss of our data, loss or damage to our data delivery systems, and other electronic security breaches. Due to the large number of transactions that run through our systems each day, significant system down-time or slow-down could have a material impact on our ability to conduct business, process and record transactions, as well as make operational and financial decisions. In addition, as we continue to grow the volume of transactions in our businesses, our existing IT systems infrastructure, applications and related functionality may be unable to effectively support a larger scale operation, which can cause the information being processed to be unreliable and impact our decision-making or damage our reputation with customers.\nIn addition to our own vulnerabilities, our reliance on email transmissions over public networks to process certain transactions exposes us to risks associated with the failure of our customers, business partners and other third parties to use appropriate controls to protect sensitive information, as well as to risks of on-line fraud and email scams. Furthermore, despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and prevent future cybersecurity attacks, it is possible that our business, financial and other systems could be compromised, especially because such attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including persons involved in organized crime or associated with external service providers. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or use electronic means to induce the company to enter into fraudulent transactions. Past and future occurrences of such attacks could damage our reputation and our ability to conduct our business, impact our credit and risk exposure decisions, cause us to lose customers or revenues, subject us to litigation and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these issues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe currently maintain insurance to protect against cybersecurity risks and incidents. However, insurance coverage may not available in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, insurance coverage may be insufficient or may not cover certain of these cybersecurity risks and, even if available, the insurance proceeds received for any loss or damage may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities without materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe personal information that we collect may be vulnerable to breach, theft, loss or misuse that could increase operational costs, result in regulatory penalties and adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nIn connection with various businesses we operate, such as our transaction management and payment processing businesses, we have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information from our employees, customers (both corporate and individual consumers), suppliers and other third parties, some of which may be subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer imposed controls. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, process, transmit and retain sensitive information regarding these parties. Despite our efforts to protect this information, our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data and programming and human errors that could potentially lead to such information being compromised.\nFailure to adequately protect this information could lead to substantial fines, penalties, third party liability, remediation costs, potential cancellation of existing contracts and inability to compete for future business. Due to legislative and regulatory rules, we may be required to notify the owners of such information of any data breaches, which could harm our business relationships, reputation and financial results, as well as subject us to litigation or actions by regulatory authorities. Furthermore, there has been heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data security in the U.S. and abroad (particularly in the European Union). Significant changes in applicable regulations may require us to make costly changes to our systems. Although we have taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security and internal control measures, these steps may not prevent a data security breach and any data security breach may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBusiness acquisitions and strategic investments, such as joint venture arrangements, present increased risks and uncertainties, which if realized, could result in costs that outweigh the financial benefit of such opportunities.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have been acquisitive and intend to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities of fuel resellers, logistics and transaction management and payment processing companies, energy management businesses, as well as other service and technology businesses. However, our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy depends on our ability to find attractive acquisition candidates or strategic investments, consummate such transactions on economically acceptable terms and, if necessary, finance such transactions on economically acceptable terms. From time to time, we may also enter into joint venture arrangements, equity investments intended to complement or expand our business, or may pursue organic growth initiatives, as well as divest of certain of our businesses or assets. These types of transactions can pose substantial risks and liabilities associated with their operations, as well as the risk that our relationships with our partners do not succeed in the manner that we anticipate. Even if we are successful in acquiring these businesses or consummating these strategic investments, we could be exposed to additional business and operating risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively integrate the operations, financial reporting, and personnel of acquired companies and manage acquired businesses or strategic investments, while maintaining uniform standards and controls;\n\u2022\nour ability to realize our investment and anticipated synergies in the acquired businesses or strategic investments;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns, the potentially negative impact of changes in management on existing business relationships and other disruptions of our business;\n\u2022\nthe risks associated with entering into businesses or markets in which we may have no or limited direct prior experience;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\na decrease in our liquidity resulting from a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity being used to fund acquisitions and a corresponding increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to fund acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe ability to integrate the IT systems of acquired businesses into our existing IT infrastructure and manage those systems that cannot be effectively integrated;\n\u2022\nthe requirement to write down acquired assets as a result of the acquired business or strategic investment being worth less than we paid or invested in it;\n\u2022\ncapital expenditure requirements exceeding our estimates;\n\u2022\nthe risk that an acquisition or strategic investment could reduce our future earnings; and\n\u2022\nthe assumption of material liabilities, exposure to litigation, regulatory noncompliance or unknown liabilities, and no or limited indemnities from sellers or ongoing indemnity obligations to purchasers.\nThese risks may result in an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition or result in costs that outweigh the financial benefit of such opportunities.\nFurthermore these acquisitions or strategic investments may result in us incurring substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses or consummating potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities to fund the required capital investment. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, inhibit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise restrict our operations.\nAdverse conditions in the aviation, marine and land transportation industries may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is focused on the marketing of fuel and other related products and services primarily to the aviation, marine and land transportation industries, which are generally affected by economic cycles. Therefore, weak economic conditions can have a negative impact on the business of our customers which may, in turn, have an adverse effect on our business. For example, during 2016, our marine segment was significantly impacted by the economic conditions adversely affecting the maritime industry. In addition, any political instability, natural disasters and other weather-related events, terrorist activity or military action that disrupts shipping, flight operations or land transportation will adversely affect our customers and may reduce the demand for our products and services. Our business could also be adversely affected by increased merger activity in the aviation, marine or land transportation industries, which may reduce the number of customers that purchase our products and services, as well as the prices we are able to charge for such products and services.\nIn addition, the aviation, marine and land transportation industries are subject to continuing changes in laws and regulations, including environmental regulations mandating or incentivizing alternative energy sources or attempting to control or limit emissions and pollution. For example, amendments to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, or MARPOL, established a phased reduction of the sulfur content in fuel oil and allows for stricter sulfur limits in designated emission control areas. Further changes in laws and regulations applicable to international and national maritime trade are expected over the coming years. Complying with these and other laws and regulations may require capital expenditures by our customers or otherwise increase our customers\u2019 operating costs, which could in turn, reduce the demand for our products and services or impact the pricing or availability of the products we sell. Although the ultimate impact of any regulations is difficult to predict accurately, they could have a material adverse effect on our business or on the businesses of our customers.\nOur business is subject to seasonal variability, which can cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate and adversely affect the market price of our shares.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal variability. Our seasonality results from numerous factors, including traditionally higher demand for natural gas and home heating oil during the winter months and aviation and land fuel during the summer months, as well as other seasonal weather patterns. As such, our results for the fourth and first quarters of the year tend to be the strongest while the second quarter is generally the weakest. However, extreme or unseasonable weather conditions could significantly reduce demand for our products and services which can, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations. There can be no assurance that seasonal variability factors will continue in future periods. Accordingly, results for any one quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year. These seasonal fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may adversely affect the market price of our shares.\nWe are subject to unique business risks as a result of selling to government customers and reduced sales to our government customers could adversely affect our profitability.\nSales to government customers, which includes sales to the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and other government and military customers, account for a significant portion of our profitability, particularly in our aviation segment. A decrease in defense spending as a result of factors such as U.S. and foreign government budget constraints or the withdrawal of armed forces from Afghanistan could result in a significant reduction in sales and related profit in our government services business. Furthermore, due to the nature of these types of conflicts, withdrawals from certain areas may be sudden, subjecting us to losses or higher expenses associated with disposing of unused inventory, removal or abandonment of equipment and relocation of employees. Government contracts are requirements based, and therefore profitability associated with our government services business may fluctuate significantly from time to time as a result of the commencement, extension or completion of existing and new government contracts. As a result of complex logistics and extended payment terms for our government customers, sales of products and services to such customers generally carry higher margins than sales to other customers. Accordingly, a decrease in government sales could contribute disproportionately to a reduction in our gross margin and profitability and such decrease could be sudden. The loss of a significant government customer or a material reduction in sales to government customers would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, contracting with government customers is inherently complex. Government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other requirements, which affects how we transact business with our customers and can impose additional costs on our business operations. Government contracts are also generally subject to oversight, including audits and investigations which could identify violations of these agreements or applicable procurement regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation for contracts with the U.S. federal government. Such violations, including those caused by our subcontractors, could result in a range of consequences including, but not limited to, contract price adjustments, civil and criminal penalties, contract termination, forfeiture of profit and/or suspension of payment, and suspension or debarment from future government contracts. The occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in the market price of fuel may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFuel prices are impacted by many factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nglobal economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in global crude oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nexpected and actual supply and demand for fuel;\n\u2022\nthe ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to set and maintain production levels for oil;\n\u2022\noil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022\ngeopolitical conditions;\n\u2022\nlaws and regulations related to environmental matters, including those mandating or incentivizing alternative energy sources or otherwise addressing global climate change;\n\u2022\nchanges in pricing or production controls by various organizations and oil producing countries;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption or supply;\n\u2022\nenergy conservation efforts;\n\u2022\nprice and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u2022\nweather.\nIf fuel prices increase, our customers may not be able to purchase as much fuel from us because of their credit limits with us and the resulting adverse impact on their business could cause them to be unable to make payments owed to us for fuel purchased on credit. They may also choose to reduce the amount of fuel they consume in their operations to reduce costs or comply with new environmental regulations to obtain associated incentives. For example, in the shipping industry a number of container ships sail at reduced speeds, known as \u201cslow steaming,\u201d to conserve fuel and reduce carbon emissions. In any such event, the volume of orders from our customers may thereafter decrease and we may not be able to replace lost volumes with new or existing customers. In addition, if fuel prices increase, our own credit limits could prevent us from purchasing enough fuel from our suppliers to meet our customers\u2019 demands or could require us to prepay for fuel purchases which would impair our liquidity.\nConversely, extended periods of low fuel prices, particularly when coupled with low price volatility, can also have an adverse effect on our results of operations and overall profitability. This outcome can be due to a number of factors, including reduced demand from our customers involved in the oil exploration sector and for our price risk management products. Low fuel prices also facilitate increased competition by reducing financial barriers to entry and enabling existing, lower-capitalized competitors to conduct more business as a result of lower working capital requirements.\nFinally, we maintain fuel inventories for competitive or logistical reasons. Because fuel is a commodity, we have no control over the changing market value of our inventory although we may manage or hedge this price exposure with derivatives. Our inventory is valued using the weighted average cost methodology and is stated at the lower of average cost or market. A rapid decline in fuel prices could cause our inventory value to be higher than market, resulting in our inventory being marked down to market or the inventory itself sold at lower prices. While we attempt to mitigate these fluctuations through hedging, such hedges may not be fully effective. Accordingly, if the market value of our inventory is less than our average cost and to the extent our hedges are not effective at mitigating fluctuations in prices, we could record a write down of inventory on hand and incur a non-cash charge or suffer losses as fuel is sold, which could adversely impact our earnings.\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business and future operating results.\nBecause we offer fuel products and services on a worldwide basis, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our business and future operating results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and import, export and other licensing requirements, which could increase our costs or prevent us from doing certain business internationally;\n\u2022\nthe costs of hiring and retaining senior management for overseas operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, which could reduce our productivity;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements, which may be costly and require significant time to implement;\n\u2022\nlaws restricting us from repatriating profits earned from our activities within foreign countries, including the payment of distributions;\n\u2022\ngovernmental actions that may result in the deprivation of our contractual rights or the inability to obtain or retain authorizations required to conduct our business;\n\u2022\npolitical risks, including changes in governments; and\n\u2022\nterrorism, war, civil unrest and natural disasters.\nIn particular, we operate in certain international markets which have been plagued by corruption and have uncertain regulatory environments, either of which could have a negative impact on our operations there. Furthermore, many countries in which we operate have historically been, and may continue to be, susceptible to recessions or currency devaluation.\nWe also operate in certain high risk locations that have been experiencing military action, terrorist activity or continued unrest which could disrupt the supply of fuel or otherwise disrupt our operations in those areas. An act of terror could result in disruptions of fuel supply and oil markets, and our facilities could be direct or indirect targets. Terrorist activity may also hinder our ability to transport fuel if our means of transportation become damaged as a result of an attack. In these high risk locations, we may also incur substantial operating costs, including maintaining the safety of our personnel. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel in these locations and there is a risk of serious injury or loss of life of employees or subcontractors.\nMaterial disruptions in the availability or supply of fuel would adversely affect our business.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to purchase, sell and coordinate delivery of fuel and related services to our customers. Political instability, natural disasters, transportation, terminal or pipeline capacity constraints, terrorist activity, piracy, military action or other similar conditions may disrupt the availability or supply of fuel. Decreased availability or supply of fuel or other petroleum products may have a negative impact on our sales and margins and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we rely on a single or limited number of suppliers for the provision of fuel and related products and services in certain markets. These parties may have significant negotiating leverage over us, and if they are unable or unwilling to supply us on commercially reasonable terms, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition and, if we are not able to effectively compete in our markets, our revenues and profits may decrease.\nCompetitive pressures in our markets could adversely affect our competitive position, leading to a possible loss of market share or a decrease in prices, either of which could result in decreased revenues and profits. Our competitors are numerous, ranging from large multinational corporations, which have significantly greater capital resources than we do, to relatively small and specialized firms. In addition to competing with resellers, we also compete with the major oil producers that market fuel and other energy products directly to the large commercial airlines, shipping companies and commercial and industrial users. Although many major oil companies have been divesting their downstream assets, some continue to compete with us in certain markets while others may decide to reenter the market in the future. Our business could be adversely affected because of increased competition from these oil companies, who may choose to increase their direct marketing in order to compete with us or provide less advantageous price and credit terms to us than to our fuel reseller competitors.\nIf we are unable to retain our senior management and key employees, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent on the services of our senior management and key personnel. Although we have employment or severance agreements with certain of our key employees, these agreements do not prevent those individuals from ceasing their employment with us at any time. If we are unable to retain existing senior management and key personnel, or to attract other qualified senior management and key personnel on terms satisfactory to us, our business could be adversely affected. While we maintain key man life insurance with respect to certain members of senior management, our coverage levels may not be sufficient to offset any losses we may incur and there is no assurance that we will continue to maintain key man life insurance in the future.\nOur failure to comply with the requirements of our Credit Facility and Term Loans could adversely affect our operating flexibility.\nWe have the ability to borrow money pursuant to a Credit Facility and Term Loans that impose certain operating and financial covenants on us, which restrict our ability to (i) pay dividends, (ii) incur additional debt, (iii) create liens, (iv) make restricted payments, (v) sell assets and (vi) engage in mergers or acquisitions. Our failure or inability to comply with the requirements of these facilities, including meeting certain financial ratios or other covenants, could limit the availability under our Credit Facility or result in an event of default. An event of default, if not cured or waived, would permit acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness under these facilities, could trigger cross defaults under other agreements to which we are a party (such as certain derivative contracts), and would impair our ability to obtain working capital advances and letters of credit, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to successfully manage the implementation of an upgrade to our global enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) platform, our operations and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIn 2015, we committed to undertake a multi-year project designed to drive greater improvement in operating efficiencies and optimize scalability, particularly when integrating future acquisitions. We will accomplish this in part by a global design and deployment of an upgrade to our existing ERP platform. We are currently in the early planning phase and the costs incurred to date have not been significant. We expect the total cost of the project over the next three years to range between $30.0 million and $40.0 million. If we fail to successfully implement the upgrade to our existing ERP platform, or should we experience material delays in implementation, our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected. Estimating the expenditures related to an upgrade of an ERP platform is highly complex and subject to variables that can significantly increase costs. Should the actual costs exceed our estimates, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by legislation and competition from other energy sources and new or advanced technology.\nFuel competes with other sources of energy, some of which are less costly on an equivalent energy basis. There are significant governmental incentives and consumer pressures to increase the use of alternative fuels in the United States and abroad. A number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing more fuel efficient engines, hybrid engines and alternative clean power systems using fuel cells or clean burning gaseous fuels. The more successful these alternatives become as a result of governmental incentives or regulations, technological advances, consumer demand, improved pricing or otherwise, the greater the potential negative impact on pricing and demand for our products and services and accordingly, our profitability.\nIn addition, federal, state, local and/or foreign governments may enact legislation or regulations that attempt to control or limit GHGs such as carbon dioxide. Such laws or regulations could impose costs tied to carbon emissions, operational requirements or restrictions, or additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities. They could also provide a cost advantage to alternative energy sources, result in other costs or requirements, such as costs associated with the adoption of new infrastructure and technology to respond to new mandates, or impose costs or restrictions on end users of fuel. For example, some of our customers in the transportation industry may be required to purchase allowances or offsets or incur other costs to comply with existing or future requirements relating to GHG. Finally, the focus on climate change could also negatively impact the reputation of fuel products or services such as those we offer. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could put upward pressure on the cost of fuel relative to other energy sources, increase our costs and the prices we charge our customers, reduce the demand for our products, and therefore adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nInsurance coverage for some of our operations may be insufficient to cover losses, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe maintain insurance to cover various risks associated with the operation of our business. Certain risks, however, such as environmental risks, are not fully insurable and our insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses, costs, or liabilities. Accordingly, our insurance policies may not adequately cover or may have exclusions of coverage for certain losses. Therefore, our insurance coverage may not be available or, if available, may not be adequate to cover claims that may arise.\nFurthermore, our ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance and the cost of such insurance may be affected by significant claims and conditions in the insurance market over which we have no control. If the cost of insurance increases, we may decide to discontinue certain insurance coverage, reduce our level of coverage or increase our deductibles/retentions in order to offset the cost increase. In addition, our existing types and levels of insurance coverage could become difficult or impossible to obtain in the future. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance, the loss of insurance coverage or a significant increase in the cost of insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCurrent and future litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are currently, and may in the future be, involved in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Lawsuits and other administrative or legal proceedings as well as any governmental investigations can involve substantial costs, including the costs associated with investigation, litigation and possible settlement, judgment, penalty or fine. Although we generally maintain insurance to mitigate certain costs, costs associated with lawsuits or other legal proceedings may exceed the limits of insurance policies, which could adversely impact our results of operations. Furthermore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected if a judgment, penalty or fine is not fully covered by insurance.\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of our business transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. In particular markets, however, payments to certain of our fuel suppliers and from certain of our customers are denominated in local currency. We also have certain liabilities, primarily for local operations, including income and transactional taxes, which are denominated in foreign currencies. This subjects us to foreign currency exchange risk. Although we generally use hedging strategies to manage and minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange risk when available, these hedges may be costly and at any given time, only a portion of this risk may be hedged. Accordingly, our exposure to this risk may be substantial and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could adversely affect our profitability.\nIn addition, many of our customers are based outside of the U.S. and may be required to purchase U.S. dollars to pay for our products and services. A rapid depreciation or devaluation in currency that affects our customers could have an adverse effect on their operations and their ability to convert local currency to U.S. dollars in order to make required payments to us. This could, in turn, increase our credit losses and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe U.K.\u2019s proposed withdrawal from the E.U. could harm our business and financial results.\nAs a result of the June 23, 2016 referendum in which British voters approved an exit from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d), commonly referred to as \"Brexit\", it is expected that the British government will commence negotiations to determine the terms of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U. A withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the E.U., undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the U.K. and the E.U. or other nations as the U.K. pursues independent trade relations. These factors pose a risk to the overall U.K. economy and as a result, our operations in the U.K., particularly in our land segment, as well as our global operations, could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, the announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound and other currencies may harm our results of operations as the local currency results of our international operations may translate into fewer U.S. dollars. Uncertainty over Brexit and currency fluctuations could also impact our customers, who may closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets on our products and services, which in turn, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, our hedging activities may not be effective to mitigate volatile fuel prices and may expose us to counterparty risk.\nFinally, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. We may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to such potentially divergent regulatory frameworks. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to E.U. or other markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. would have and how such withdrawal would affect us. Adverse consequences concerning Brexit or the E.U. could include deterioration in global economic conditions, instability in global financial markets, political uncertainty, continued volatility in currency exchange rates, or adverse changes in the cross-border agreements currently in place, any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future.\nCurrent and proposed derivatives legislation and rulemaking could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Dodd Frank Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) provides for federal regulation of the over the counter derivative markets both for commodities and securities, and gives the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the SEC broad authority to regulate such markets and their participants. This includes, among others, derivative transactions linked to crude oil, refined products and natural gas prices. The Dodd-Frank Act and the rules being promulgated thereunder subject certain swap participants to capital and margin requirements and business conduct standards. If we or our derivatives counterparties are subject to additional requirements imposed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, this may increase our transaction costs or make it more difficult for us to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms. Our inability to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms, or at all, could increase our operating expenses and put us at increased exposure to risks of adverse changes in energy commodities prices. Further, on December 30, 2016, the CFTC re-proposed new position limits rules for public comment, which would limit trading in options, futures, and swaps contracts related to certain agricultural, metal, and energy commodities, including energy commodities in which we currently engage in derivative transactions, and solicited public comment with respect to the same. These rules have not been finalized, and we cannot currently predict whether or when the re-proposed rules will be adopted, in what form the rules will be adopted, or the effect of the final rules, if any, on our businesses. Any such regulations could also subject our derivatives counterparties to limits on commodity positions and thereby have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business or on the cost of our hedging activity.\nIn addition, upcoming E.U. derivative regulations and other legislation regulating the use of derivatives that certain foreign jurisdictions have adopted or are in the process of adopting, could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, in early 2016, the E.U. Commission announced that the deadline for two key sets of derivative regulations schedules to come into effect, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (\u201cMiFID II\u201d) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (\u201cMiFIR\u201d), originally set for January 2017, had been postponed to January 2018. As we approach the January 2018 MiFID II and MiFIR regulatory implementation, we will continue to evaluate how these E.U. regulations, may impact our ability to conduct our business.\nAny new (or newly implemented) regulations and international legislation could:\n\u2022\nsignificantly increase the cost of our derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral, which could adversely affect our cash flows and liquidity, or require us to obtain licenses and subject us directly or indirectly to additional reporting and other requirements),\n\u2022\nmaterially alter the terms of our derivative contracts,\n\u2022\nreduce our ability to offer derivative and other price management products to our customers,\n\u2022\nrequire that we limit our derivatives activities to avoid being subject to burdensome requirements and regulations;\n\u2022\nreduce the demand for our price risk management services,\n\u2022\nreduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter,\n\u2022\nincrease price volatility in the commodities we buy and sell (and derivatives related to those commodities),\n\u2022\naffect cash flow and liquidity due to margin calls,\n\u2022\nreduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing commodity price contracts, and\n\u2022\nincrease our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties.\nIf the increased cost of derivative contracts is significant or we reduce or limit our derivatives activities as a result of any such legislation or rules, our profitability and results of operations could be adversely affected. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition, and our results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 75070, "SIC": 5172, "TIC": "INT"}
