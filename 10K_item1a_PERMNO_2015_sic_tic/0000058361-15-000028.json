{"cik": "58361", "company": "LEE ENTERPRISES, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-12-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisk exists that our past results may not be indicative of future results. A discussion of our risk factors follows. See also, \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d, included herein. In addition, a number of other factors (those identified elsewhere in this document) may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.\nDEBT AND LIQUIDITY\nWe May Have Insufficient Earnings Or Liquidity To Meet Our Future Debt Obligations\nWe have a substantial amount of debt, as discussed more fully (and certain capitalized terms used below defined) in Item 7,\"Liquidity\" and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein. Since February 2009, we have satisfied all interest payments and substantially all principal payments due under our debt facilities with our cash flows and asset sales.\nAs of September 27, 2015, our debt consists of the following:\n\u2022\n$400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 9.5% Senior Secured Notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d), pursuant to an Indenture dated as of March 31, 2014 (the \u201cIndenture\u201d);\n\u2022\n$250,000,000 first lien term loan (the \"1st Lien Term Loan\") and $40,000,000 revolving facility (the \"Revolving Facility\") under a First Lien Credit Agreement dated as of March 31, 2014 (together, the \u201c1st Lien Credit Facility\u201d), of which $180,872,000 is outstanding at September 27, 2015; and\n\u2022\n$150,000,000 second lien term loan under a Second Lien Loan Agreement dated as of March 31, 2014 (the \u201c 2nd Lien Term Loan\u201d), of which $145,000,000 is outstanding at September 27, 2015.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate future cash flows from operations. Cash generated from future asset sales could serve as an additional source of repayment. This ability, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nAt September 27, 2015, after consideration of letters of credit, we have approximately $32,935,000 available for future use under our Revolving Facility. Including cash, our liquidity at September 27, 2015 totals $44,069,000. This liquidity amount excludes any future cash flows. Our unlevered free cash flow(1) has been strong for the last seven years and has exceeded $149,000,000 in each year from 2011 through 2015, but there can be no assurance that such cash flows will continue. We expect all interest and principal payments due in the next twelve months will be satisfied by our continuing cash flows and certain asset sales, which will allow us to maintain an adequate level of liquidity.\nAt September 27, 2015, the principal amount of our outstanding debt totals $725,872,000. At September 27, 2015, our debt, net of cash, is 4.4 times our 2015 adjusted EBITDA(1), compared to a ratio of 4.7 times at September 28, 2014.\nFinal maturities of our debt are March 2019 through December 2022. As a result, refinancing risk has been substantially reduced for the next several years.\nThere are numerous potential consequences under the Notes, 1st Lien Credit Facility, 2nd Lien Term Loan, if an event of default, as defined, occurs and is not remedied. Many of those consequences are beyond our control. The occurrence of one or more events of default would give rise to the right of the applicable lenders to exercise their remedies under the Notes, 1st Lien Credit Facility, 2nd Lien Term Loan, respectively, including, without limitation, the right to accelerate all outstanding debt and take actions authorized in such circumstances under applicable collateral security documents.\n(1) See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures: in Item 7, included herein, for additional information.\nOur ability to operate as a going concern is dependent on our ability to remain in compliance with debt covenants and to refinance or amend our debt agreements as they become due, if necessary. The Notes, 1st Lien Credit Facility and 2nd Lien Term Loan have only limited affirmative covenants with which we are required to maintain compliance. We are in compliance with our debt covenants at September 27, 2015.\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS\nGeneral Economic Conditions May Continue To Impact Our Revenue And Operating Results\nAccording to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the United States economy was in a recession from December 2007 until June 2009. Our revenue, operating results and cash flows were significantly impacted by the recession and\nits aftermath. The duration and depth of an economic recession, and pace of economic recovery, in markets in which we operate, may influence our future results.\nOPERATING REVENUE\nOur Revenue May Not Return To Historical Levels\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from advertising. The demand for advertising is sensitive to the overall level of economic activity, both locally and nationally. Newspaper publishing is both capital and labor intensive and, as a result, newspapers may not be able to quickly reduce cost. Accordingly, changes in advertising and circulation revenue could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations.\nOperating revenue in most categories has decreased since 2007 and may decrease in the future. Such decreases may not be offset by growth in advertising in other categories, such as digital revenue which has been rising since 2010. Historically, newspaper publishing has been viewed as a cost-effective method of delivering various forms of advertising. There can be no guarantee that this historical perception will guide future decisions on the part of advertisers. Web sites and applications for mobile devices distributing news and other content continue to gain popularity. As a result, audience attention and advertising spending are shifting and may continue to shift from traditional media to digital media. As media audiences fragment, we expect that advertisers will allocate greater portions of their future budgets to digital media, which can offer more measurable returns than traditional print media through pay for performance and keyword-targeted advertising. If our efforts to adapt to evolving technological developments in the media industry are unsuccessful, or if we fail to correctly anticipate shifts in audience demand and digital media trends, we may be unable to provide the services, media and content that audiences and potential audiences in our markets prefer and we may be unable to provide the returns on ad spending that our advertisers seek. This increased competition has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business and financial results. The digital media industry experiences additional competitive challenges because barriers to entry can be low and geographic location is less relevant.\nTechnological developments also pose other challenges that could adversely affect our revenue and competitive position. New delivery platforms may lead to pricing restrictions and the loss of a direct relationship with consumers. We may also be adversely affected if the use of technology developed to block the display of advertising on websites and other digital platforms proliferates.\nThe rates we charge for advertising are, in part, related to the size of the audience of our publications and digital products. There is significant competition for readers and viewers from other media. Our business may be adversely affected to the extent individuals decide to obtain news, entertainment, classified listings and local shopping information from digital or other media, to the exclusion of our outlets for such information.\nRetail Advertising\nMany advertisers, including major retail store chains, automobile manufacturers and dealers, banks and telecommunications companies, have experienced significant merger and acquisition activity over the last several years, and some have gone out of business, effectively reducing the number of brand names under which the merged entities operate. Changes in the economy and consumer shopping habits such as the increasing use of online shopping, drive advertising spending and retailers approach to advertising and marketing their goods and services.\nClassified Advertising\nClassified advertising is the category that has been most significantly impacted by changing advertising trends and the increase in digital/classified advertising competitors. All categories of classified advertising have generally declined since 2007.\nSee \"Advertising and Marketing Services\u201d in Item 1, included herein, for additional information on the risks associated with advertising revenue.\nSubscription Revenue\nAdvertising and subscription revenue is affected by readership of our print publications and digital products. Although our aggregate print and digital audience is relatively stable, subscription sales have nonetheless been declining for\nmany years, reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry, including consumer migration toward digital platforms and other media for news and information. The possibility exists that future subscription price increases may be difficult to accomplish or maintain as a result of future declines in subscription sales, and that price decreases may be necessary to retain or grow subscription volume. We are maintaining our share of audience through digital audience growth and strong print newspaper readership.\nIn addition, as audience attention increasingly focuses on digital media, print circulation of our newspapers may be adversely affected, which may decrease subscription revenue and exacerbate declines in print advertising. We face increasing competition from other digital sources for subscription revenue. This competition has intensified as a result of the continued development of digital media technologies. To maintain our subscription base, we may be required to incur additional costs that we may not be able to recover through subscription and advertising revenue. We may not be able to achieve a profitable balance between subscription levels and advertising revenue. In addition, if we are not successful in growing our digital businesses, including digital subscription revenue, to offset declines in revenue from our print products, our business, financial condition and prospects will be adversely affected.\nIn 2011, we began introducing charges for access to digital content using a metered model in certain of our markets and ended free, unlimited access to those newspapers\u2019 websites. In 2014, we began the transition of our subscriptions to full access, including the printed edition, desktop, mobile and tablet. Our ability to build a subscriber base on our digital platforms through these packages depends on market acceptance, consumer habits, pricing, an adequate digital infrastructure, terms of delivery platforms and other factors. In addition, the metered model and/or the price increases may result in fewer page views or unique visitors to our digital platforms if viewers are unwilling to pay to gain access to our digital content. Stagnation, or a decline in traffic levels, may adversely affect our advertiser base and advertising rates and result in a decline in digital revenue.\nSee \"Audiences\u201d in Item 1, included herein, for additional information on the risks associated with subscription revenue.\nIf We Are Not Successful In Growing Our Digital Business, Our Business, Financial Condition, Results Of Operations And Prospects Could Be Adversely Affected\nOur future performance depends to a significant degree upon the development and management of our digital business. The growth of our digital business over the long term depends on various factors, including, among other things, the ability to:\n\u2022\nContinue to increase digital audiences;\n\u2022\nAttract advertisers to our digital platforms;\n\u2022\nMaintain or increase the advertising rates on our digital platforms;\n\u2022\n\u2022\nExploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of competitors and develop new content, products and services;\n\u2022\nInvest funds and resources in digital opportunities; and\n\u2022\nPartner with, or use services from, providers that can assist us in effectively growing our digital business.\nIn addition, we expect that our digital business will continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenue. In 2015, total digital revenue (including revenue from digital subscriptions) comprised 18.0% of total revenue, as compared to 13.8% in 2014. As our digital business becomes a greater portion of our overall business, we will face a number of increased risks from managing our digital operations, including, but not limited, to the following:\n\u2022\nContinuing training of our sales force to more effectively sell advertising in the digital advertising arena versus our historical print advertising business;\n\u2022\nAttracting and retaining employees with skill sets and the knowledge base needed to successfully operate our digital business; and\n\u2022\nManaging the transition to a digital business from a historically print-focused business.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nWe May Not Be Able To Reduce Future Expenses To Offset Potential Revenue Declines\nWe reduced cash costs of our continuing operations (compensation, newsprint and ink, other operating expenses and workforce adjustments) significantly since 2011. Such expense reductions are not expected to significantly impact our ability to deliver advertising, news or other content to our customers. As a result of the significantly reduced cost structure to date, future cost reductions may not be as significant.\nNewsprint comprises a significant amount of our operating costs. See \u201cNewsprint\u201d in Item 1, and \u201cCommodities\u201d in Item 7A, included herein, for additional information on the risks associated with changes in newsprint costs.\nIn addition, technological developments and changes we need to make to our business, may require significant capital investments. We may be limited in our ability to invest funds and resources in digital products, services or opportunities, and we may incur costs of research and development in building and maintaining the necessary and continually evolving technology infrastructure. As a result, our digital business could suffer if we are unable to make the investments.\nWe May Incur Additional Non-Cash Impairment Charges\nWe have significant amounts of goodwill and identified intangible assets. Since 2007 we have recorded impairment charges totaling almost $1.3 billion to reduce the value of certain of these assets. Should general economic, market or business conditions decline, and have a negative impact on our stock price or projected future cash flows, we may be required to record additional impairment charges in the future. Such charges would not impact our cash flows or debt covenant compliance. See \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d in Item 7, included herein, for additional information on the risks associated with such assets.\nSustained Increases In Funding Requirements Of Our Pension and Postretirement Obligations\nMay Reduce The Cash Available For Our Business\nPension liabilities, net of plan assets, totaled $52.5 million at September 27, 2015. Contributions to pension plans are expected to total $5.8 million in 2016. At September 27, 2015 the assets of our postretirement plans exceeded plan liabilities by $13.4 million.\nOur pension and postretirement plans invest in a variety of equity and debt securities. Future volatility and disruption in the securities markets could cause declines in the values of our pension assets. In addition, a decrease in the discount rates used to determine the liability for obligations could result in increased future contributions. If either occurs, we may need to make additional cash contributions above what is currently estimated, which could reduce the cash available for our business. Moreover, under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the \"PPA\"), future losses of asset value may necessitate accelerated funding of pension plans in the future to meet minimum federal statutory requirements. Legislation passed in 2012, 2014 and 2015 temporarily reduced funding requirements for our pension plans, but those payments will eventually need to be restored unless discount rates and/or plan assets increase.\nWe used new mortality assumptions to value our pension and postretirement liabilities at September 28, 2014, which increased such liabilities, in total, by approximately $18.5 million, with a corresponding decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of that date.\nWe Expect To Be Subject To Withdrawal Liability In Connection With One Multiemployer Pension Plan And May Be Subject To Additional Withdrawal Liabilities In Connection With Other Multiemployer Pension Plans, Which May Reduce The Cash Available For Our Business\nPursuant to our collective bargaining obligations, we contribute to three multiemployer pension plans on behalf of certain of our employees. Based on the most recent communications from the plans\u2019 administrators, two of these plans are currently in \u201ccritical\u201d status, as that term is used in relation to such plans under the PPA. For plans that are in critical status, benefit reductions may apply and/or we could be required to make additional contributions.\nOne of our enterprise's bargaining units withdrew from representation, and as a result we will be subject to a future claim from the multiemployer pension plan for a withdrawal liability. The amount of such liability, if any, will be dependent\non actions taken, or not taken, by the Company and the pension plan, as well as the future investment performance and funding status of the pension plan. The withdrawal liability is expected to be funded over a 20 year period.\nIf, we were to withdraw from one of these plans or trigger a partial withdrawal due to declines in contribution base units, and the plan had unfunded vested benefits at the time of our withdrawal or partial withdrawal, we could incur a significant plan withdrawal liability, which could reduce the cash available for our business.\nEQUITY CAPITAL\nA Decrease In Our Stock Price May Limit The Ability To Trade Our Stock\nOr For The Company To Raise Equity Capital\nUnder the NYSE listing standards, if our common stock fails to maintain an adequate per share price and our total market capitalization falls below $50.0 million, our common stock could be removed from the NYSE and traded in the over the counter market. In July 2011, the NYSE notified us that our common stock did not meet the NYSE continued listing standards due to the failure to maintain an adequate share price. Under the NYSE rules, our common stock was allowed to continue to be listed during a cure period. In February 2012, after completing our debt refinancing, the NYSE notified us that we were again in compliance with the minimum closing price standard. In January 2013, the NYSE notified us that we had returned to full compliance with all continued listing standards. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to meet these listing standards, and the removal of our common stock from the NYSE could adversely affect our ability to raise equity capital.\nOTHER\nCybersecurity Risks Could Harm Our Ability To Operate Effectively\nIn the 13-weeks ended September 27, 2015, 19.9% of our revenue was obtained from digital sources, including advertising, subscriptions and one of our businesses, TownNews.com, that provides digital infrastructure and digital publishing services for us and other companies.\nWe use computers and digital technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including the misappropriation of personally identifiable information that we store and manage and disabling or taking over of our websites. We have preventive systems and processes in place to protect against the risk of cyber incidents. However, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access and to disable systems and websites change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. There can be no assurance that we, or the security systems we implement, will protect against all of these rapidly changing risks. Prolonged system outages or a cyber incident that goes undetected could reduce our print and/or digital revenue, increase our operating costs, disrupt our operations, harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers and/or subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data. We maintain insurance coverage against certain of such risks, but cannot guarantee that such coverage will be applicable or sufficient with respect to any given incident.\nWe May Not Be Able To Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights, Which May Adversely Affect Our Business\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, including our valuable brands and content. We believe our proprietary trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to our continued success and our competitive position.\nUnauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our content or infringe upon, dilute, reproduce, misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be successful in any given case.", "PERMNO": 50286, "SIC": 2711, "TIC": "LEE"}
