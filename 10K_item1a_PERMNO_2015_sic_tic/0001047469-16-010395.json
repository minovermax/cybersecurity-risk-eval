Any of the risks and uncertainties described below, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects for growth, or the value of an investment in our common stock. In addition, these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K (please read the \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" appearing at the beginning of this Form 10-K). The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and the value of an investment in our common stock and could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to Development and Commercialization of our Product Candidates\nOur near term prospects are highly dependent on the success of our most advanced product candidate, ARIKAYCE. If we are unable to successfully complete the development of, obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize ARIKAYCE, our business and the value of our common stock may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are investing substantially all of our efforts and financial resources in the development of ARIKAYCE, our most advanced product candidate. Our ability to generate product revenue from ARIKAYCE will depend heavily on the successful completion of development of, receipt of regulatory approval for, and commercialization of, ARIKAYCE.\nPositive results from preclinical studies of a drug candidate may not be predictive of similar results in human clinical trials, and promising results from earlier clinical trials of a drug candidate may not be replicated in later clinical trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier stages of development. Accordingly, the results of the completed clinical trials for ARIKAYCE may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in our clinical trials currently in progress or other trials.\nWe are conducting a global phase 3 clinical study of ARIKAYCE (the 212 or CONVERT study) in adult non-CF patients with NTM lung infections caused by MAC that are refractory to treatment. The CONVERT study is designed to confirm the culture conversion results seen in our phase 2 clinical trial (the 112 study).\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we filed an MAA with the EMA seeking approval of ARIKAYCE in the EU for the treatment of NTM lung infections based on the data from the 112 study. In February 2015 the EMA validated our MAA for ARIKAYCE for NTM lung infections, as well as cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with Pseudomonas lung infections. The EMA subsequently requested additional information with respect to the CF indication with respect to the similarity of ARIKAYCE to another product that has an orphan designation for the same indication. In the third quarter of 2015, the EMA adopted our request to withdraw the Pseudomonas indication from our MAA. We will only seek approval of ARIKAYCE for the treatment of patients with refractory NTM lung infections caused by MAC.\nIn December 2015, we submitted our responses to the EMA's 120-day questions and expect to receive the EMA's 180-day list of outstanding issues (the LOI) in the first quarter of 2016. We\nanticipate responding to the LOI and participating in an oral hearing with the CHMP in the second quarter of 2016 to address the LOI. We continue to expect the CHMP to render an opinion around the middle of 2016. There can be no assurance, however, that results from the 112 study will be sufficient to obtain full or conditional marketing approval for ARIKAYCE. If major objections raised during the review procedure are not subsequently resolved, it may impact our ability to obtain an approval without submission of additional study data. Further, even if we obtain conditional approval, it may be withdrawn under certain circumstances and confirmatory clinical studies may be required and could fail to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain full approval.\nWe do not expect ARIKAYCE or any other drug candidates we may develop to be commercially available in any market until we get requisite approval from the EMA, FDA or equivalent regulatory agency.\nWe have not completed the research and development stage of ARIKAYCE or any other product candidates other than IPLEX, which we no longer market. If we are unable to successfully commercialize ARIKAYCE or any other products, it may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and our prospects.\nOur long-term viability and growth depend on the successful commercialization of ARIKAYCE and potentially other product candidates that lead to revenue and profits. Pharmaceutical product development is an expensive, high risk, lengthy, complicated, resource intensive process. In order to conduct the development programs for our products, we must, among other things, be able to successfully:\n\u00b7 Identify potential drug product candidates; \u00b7 Design and conduct appropriate laboratory, preclinical and other research; \u00b7 Submit for and receive regulatory approval to perform clinical studies; \u00b7 Design and conduct appropriate preclinical and clinical studies according to good laboratory and good clinical practices and disease-specific expectations of FDA and other regulatory bodies; \u00b7 Select and recruit clinical investigators; \u00b7 Select and recruit subjects for our studies; \u00b7 Collect, analyze and correctly interpret the data from our studies; \u00b7 Submit for and receive regulatory approvals for marketing; \u00b7 Submit for and receive reimbursement approvals for market access: and \u00b7 Manufacture the drug product candidates and device components according to cGMP.\nThe development program with respect to any given product will take many years and thus delay our ability to generate profits. In addition, potential products that appear promising at early stages of development may fail for a number of reasons, including the possibility that the products may require significant additional testing or turn out to be unsafe, ineffective, too difficult or expensive to develop or manufacture, too difficult to administer or unstable. If we do not proceed with the development of our ARIKAYCE program in the NTM or CF indications, certain organizations that provided funding to us for such developmental efforts may elect to proceed with the development of these indications. Even if we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, including ARIKAYCE, we may not obtain labeling that permits us to market them with commercially viable claims because the final wording of the approved indication may be restrictive, or the available clinical data may not provide adequate comparative data with other products. Failure to successfully commercialize our products will adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf regulatory agencies limit our proposed NTM treatment population for ARIKAYCE, our clinical studies do not produce positive results or our clinical trials are delayed, or if serious side effects are identified during drug development, we may experience delays, incur additional costs and ultimately be unable to commercialize our product candidates in the US, Europe or other countries.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct, at our own expense, extensive preclinical tests to demonstrate the safety of our product candidates in animals, and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Significant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten the patent protection period during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates. Such delays could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our products or product candidates.\nPreclinical and clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement and can take many years to complete. Special challenges can arise in conducting trials in diseases or conditions with small populations, such as difficulties enrolling adequate numbers of patients. Our product development costs have and may continue to increase if we experience further delays in testing or approvals. A failure of one or more of our preclinical studies or clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, preclinical testing and the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent our ability to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u00b7 Our preclinical tests or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical trials or we may abandon projects that we expect to be promising; \u00b7 Regulators or institutional review boards may prevent us from commencing a clinical trial or conducting a clinical trial at a prospective trial site; \u00b7 Enrollment in the clinical trials may take longer than expected or the clinical trials as designed may not allow for sufficient patient accrual to complete enrollment of the trial; \u00b7 We may decide to limit or abandon our commercial development programs; \u00b7 Conditions imposed on us by the FDA or any non-US regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials may require us to collect and submit information to regulatory authorities, ethics committees, institutional review boards or others for review and approval; \u00b7 The number of patients required for our clinical trials may be larger than we anticipate or participants may drop out of our clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate; \u00b7 Our third party contractors, contract research organizations, which we refer to as CROs, clinical investigators, clinical laboratories, product supplier or inhalation device supplier may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or fail to meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner; \u00b7 We may have to suspend or terminate one or more of our clinical trials if we, the regulators or the institutional review boards determine that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons; \u00b7 We may not be able to claim that a product candidate provides an advantage over current standard of care or future competitive therapies in development because our clinical studies may not have been designed to support such claims; \u00b7 Regulators or institutional review boards may require that we hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including potential safety concerns or noncompliance with regulatory requirements; \u00b7 The cost of our clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u00b7 The supply or quality of product used in clinical trials or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials may be insufficient or inadequate or we may not be able to reach agreements on acceptable terms with prospective contract manufacturers or CROs; and \u00b7 The effects of our product candidates may not be the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects or the product candidates may have other unexpected characteristics.\nFor example, results from our rodent carcinogenicity study showed that when rats were given ARIKAYCE daily by inhalation for two years, two of the 120 rats receiving the highest dose developed lung carcinomas. These rats received ARIKAYCE doses that were within two-fold of those in clinical studies (normalized on a body surface area basis or a lung weight basis). Based on these results, in 2011 the FDA placed clinical holds on our phase 3 clinical trials for ARIKAYCE, which holds were lifted in 2012. In 2013, we concluded a nine month dog inhalation toxicity study. The final report from the study stated that the lung macrophage response in dogs was similar to that seen in our previous three month dosing dog study, and there was no evidence of neoplasia, squamous metaplasia or proliferative changes. However, approvability or labeling of ARIKAYCE may still be negatively affected by the prior results from the rat carcinogen study.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u00b7 Be delayed in obtaining, or may not be able to obtain, marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates; \u00b7 Obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as intended or entirely different than those indications for which we sought approval; or \u00b7 Have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nWe may not have, or may be unable to obtain, sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet our required supply for clinical studies or commercialization requirements.\nWe do not have any in-house manufacturing capability other than for development and characterization and depend completely on a small number of third-party manufacturers and suppliers for the manufacture of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. We are currently dependent on Althea for the production of ARIKAYCE. In September 2015, we entered into a Commercial Fill/Finish Services Agreement with Althea to produce ARIKAYCE on a non-exclusive basis. Althea currently manufactures ARIKAYCE at a relatively small scale. In order to meet potential commercial demand, we have constructed a manufacturing operation at Therapure in Canada as an alternate site of manufacture that operates at a larger scale. Our supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for INS1009 is dependent on a single supplier. The inability of a supplier to fulfill our supply requirements could materially adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and future operating results. A change in the relationship with any supplier, or an adverse change in their business, could materially adversely affect our future operating results.\nWe are dependent upon Althea and Therapure being able to provide an adequate supply of ARIKAYCE both for our clinical trials and for commercial sale in the event ARIKAYCE receives marketing approval. We intend to work closely with Althea and Therapure to coordinate efforts regarding regulatory requirements and our supply needs.\nWe are dependent upon PARI being able to provide an adequate supply of nebulizers both for our clinical trials and for commercial sale in the event ARIKAYCE receives marketing approval. PARI\nis the sole manufacturer of the eFlow nebulizer system. These nebulizers must be in good working order and meet specific performance characteristics. We intend to work closely with PARI to coordinate efforts regarding regulatory requirements.\nWe do not have long-term commercial agreements with all of our suppliers and if any of our suppliers are unable or unwilling to perform for any reason, we may not be able to locate suppliers or enter into favorable agreements with them. Any inability to acquire sufficient quantities of our components in a timely manner from these third parties could delay clinical trials or commercialization and prevent us from developing and distributing our products in a cost-effective manner or on a timely basis.\nIn addition, manufacturers of our components are subject to cGMP and similar standards and we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by our manufacturers. If one of our contract manufacturers fails to maintain compliance, the production of our products could be interrupted, resulting in delays and additional costs. In addition, if the facilities of such manufacturers do not pass a pre-approval or post-approval plant inspection, the FDA, as well as other regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside the US, will not grant approval and may institute restrictions on the marketing or sale of our products. We are reliant on third-party manufacturers and suppliers to meet our clinical supply demands and any future commercial products. Delays in receipt of materials, scheduling, release, custom's control and regulatory compliance issues may adversely impact our ability to initiate, maintain or complete clinical trials that we are sponsoring or may adversely impact commercialization. Issues arising from scale-up, facility construction, environmental controls, equipment requirements, local and federal permits and allowances or other factors may have an adverse impact on our ability to manufacture our product candidates.\nWe have limited experience in conducting and managing the preclinical development activities and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA and EMA and other regulatory agencies.\nWe have limited experience in conducting and managing the preclinical development activities and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA and EMA. Since our merger with Transave, we have not completed a regulatory filing and review process for, obtained regulatory approval of or commercialized any of our product candidates. Our limited experience might prevent us from successfully designing, implementing, or completing a clinical trial. The application processes for FDA, EMA and other regulatory agencies are complex and difficult and vary by regulatory agency. We have limited experience in conducting and managing the application processes necessary to obtain regulatory approvals in the various countries and we might not be able to demonstrate that our product candidates meet the appropriate standards for regulatory approval. If we are not successful in conducting and managing our preclinical development activities or clinical trials or obtaining regulatory approvals, we might not be able to commercialize ARIKAYCE, or might be significantly delayed in doing so, which may materially harm our business.\nWe may not be able to enroll enough patients to complete our clinical trials.\nThe completion rate of our global phase 3 clinical study of ARIKAYCE for NTM and other future clinical studies of our products is dependent on, among other factors, the patient enrollment rate. Patient enrollment is a function of many factors, including:\n\u00b7 Investigator identification and recruitment; \u00b7 Regulatory approvals to initiate study sites; \u00b7 Patient population size;\n\u00b7 The nature of the protocol to be used in the trial; \u00b7 Patient proximity to clinical sites; \u00b7 Eligibility criteria for the study; \u00b7 The patients' willingness to participate in the study; \u00b7 Competition from other companies' potential clinical studies for the same patient population; and \u00b7 Ability to obtain any necessary comparator drug or medical device.\nWhile we believe our procedures for enrolling patients to date have been appropriate, enrollment at certain centers is slower than expected. As a result, we expect to achieve our enrollment objective six to twelve months later than our initial expectation and now expect to enroll the study by the end of 2016. While we have taken a number of steps to accelerate enrollment, there is no guarantee that our enrollment will be completed by the expected time. Delays in patient enrollment for future clinical trials could increase costs and delay ultimate commercialization and sales, if any, of our products.\nIf any of our products meet the criteria for approval pursuant to Subpart H (accelerated approval), such approval will be subject to our carrying out, with due diligence, adequate and well-controlled post market studies to verify and describe their clinical benefit. If we fail to complete such studies with due diligence, or if the results of such studies fail to demonstrate clinical benefit, FDA may, following a hearing, withdraw product approval.\nThe commercial success of ARIKAYCE or any other product candidates that we may develop will depend upon many factors, including the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payers and others in the medical community.\nEven if we are able to successfully complete development of, obtain regulatory approval for, and bring ARIKAYCE to market, ARIKAYCE may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payers and others in the medical community. If ARIKAYCE, or any other products we bring to market, do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of ARIKAYCE and any other product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 The prevalence and severity of any side effects, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product's approved labeling; \u00b7 The efficacy and potential advantages over alternative treatments; \u00b7 The pricing of our product candidates; \u00b7 Relative convenience and ease of administration; \u00b7 The willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies; \u00b7 The strength of marketing and distribution support and timing of market introduction of competitive products; \u00b7 Publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments, including competing products becoming subject to generic pricing; and \u00b7 Sufficient third party insurance coverage and reimbursement.\nEven if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in preclinical and clinical trials, market acceptance of the product will not be known until after it is launched. For example, if a clinical trial is not designed to demonstrate advantages over alternative treatments, we may be prohibited from promoting our product candidates on any such advantages. Our efforts to\neducate the medical community and third-party payers on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. Such efforts to educate the marketplace may require more resources than are required by more established technologies marketed by our competitors.\nWe currently have a very small marketing or sales organization, and we have limited experience as a company in marketing drug products. If we are unable to establish our own marketing and sales capabilities, or are unable to enter into agreements with third parties, to market and sell our products after they are approved, we may not be able to generate product revenues.\nWe have a small commercial organization for the marketing, market access, sales and distribution of any drug products. In order to commercialize ARIKAYCE or any other product candidates, we must develop these capabilities on our own or make arrangements with third parties for the marketing, sales and distribution of our products. During 2015, we started to build our EU commercial infrastructure to support the launch of ARIKAYCE in certain countries in Europe, if approved. The establishment and development of our own sales force would be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch, and we cannot be certain that we would be able to successfully develop this capability. As a result, we may seek one or more partners to handle some or all of the sales and marketing of ARIKAYCE in certain markets. However, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with third parties to sell ARIKAYCE on favorable terms or at all. In the event we are unable to develop our own marketing, market access, and sales force or collaborate with a third-party marketing, market access, and sales organization, we may not be able to successfully commercialize ARIKAYCE or any other product candidates that we develop, which would adversely affect our ability to generate product revenues. Further, whether we commercialize products on our own or rely on a third party to do so, our ability to generate revenue will be dependent on the effectiveness of the sales force.\nPromotional materials for our approved drug products must be submitted, along with Form 2253, to FDA's Office of Prescription Drug Products (OPDP) at the time of initial dissemination or publication. For products approved pursuant to 21 CFR 314 Subpart H, promotional materials intended to be used during product launch must be submitted during the pre-approval review period, and thereafter must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication. For other products, OPDP encourages pre-launch review, and will provide advisory comments in response to such submissions upon request. There is no guarantee that OPDP will agree that the proposed promotional materials comply with applicable FDA requirements. A negative response in OPDP Advisory Comments may require us to revise planned promotional materials and may limit the claims we can use in such materials. If OPDP considers promotional materials already disseminated or published to violate applicable FDA requirements, OPDP may initiate enforcement action, including Untitled Letters (previously known as Notices of Violation), Warning Letters, Injunction/Consent decree, Seizures, Criminal prosecution, and/or civil and monetary penalties.\nWe have limited experience operating internationally, are subject to a number of risks associated with our international activities and operations and may not be successful in our efforts to expand internationally.\nWe have manufacturing, collaboration, clinical trial and other relationships outside the US but we currently have limited operations outside of the US. Specifically, as of December 31, 2015, we had 11 employees located in Europe and we expect that number to grow in 2016 and beyond as we prepare for commercialization in Europe. In order to meet our long-term goals, we will need to grow our international operations over the next several years. Consequently, we are and will continue to be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries, including:\n\u00b7 we have limited experience operating our business internationally;\n\u00b7 we may not achieve the optimal pricing and reimbursement for ARIKAYCE; \u00b7 there may be fewer addressable NTM patients than were originally forecasted; \u00b7 unexpected adverse events related to ARIKAYCE or our other product candidates that occur in foreign markets that we have not experienced in the US; \u00b7 local, economic and political conditions, including geopolitical events, such as war and terrorism, foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased or unpredictable operating expenses and reduced revenues and other obligations incident to doing business in, or with a company located in, another country; \u00b7 unexpected changes in reimbursement and pricing requirements, tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements; \u00b7 economic weakness, including foreign currency exchange risks, inflation or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets; and \u00b7 compliance with foreign or US laws, rules and regulations, including data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import, export and trade restrictions, anti- bribery/anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules, which could lead to actions by us or our licensees, distributors, manufacturers, other third parties who act on our behalf or with whom we do business in foreign countries or our employees who are working abroad that could subject us to investigation or prosecution under such foreign or US laws.\nThese and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties including clinical research organizations, or CROs, clinical laboratories, analytical laboratories and other providers for many services. If we are unable to form and sustain these relationships, or if any third-party arrangements that we may enter into are unsuccessful, our ability to develop and commercialize our products may be materially adversely affected.\nWe currently rely, and expect that we will in the future continue to rely, on third parties for significant research, analytical services, preclinical development and clinical development. For example almost all of our clinical trial work is done by CROs, such as Synteract who is our CRO for both the 212 and 312 studies, and clinical laboratories. Reliance on these third parties poses a number of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7 We may face significant competition in seeking appropriate partners; \u00b7 These arrangements are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement; \u00b7 We may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements that we might pursue on favorable terms; \u00b7 We may not be able to effectively control whether the CROs or other third parties will devote sufficient resources to our programs or products; \u00b7 We are not able to control the regulatory compliance of CROs, third-party suppliers, contractors and collaborators, including their processes and procedures, systems utilized to collect and analyze data, and equipment used to test drug product and/or clinical supplies; \u00b7 Disagreements with third parties and CROs may be difficult to resolve and could result in a dispute over and loss of intellectual property rights, delay or termination of the research, development, or commercialization of product candidates or result in litigation or arbitration; \u00b7 Contracts with our collaborators may fail to provide sufficient protection of our intellectual property; and \u00b7 We may have difficulty enforcing the contracts if one of these collaborators fails to perform.\nA great deal of uncertainty exists regarding the success of any current and future third-party efforts on which we might depend. Failure of these efforts could delay, impair, or prevent the development and commercialization of our products and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe rely on PARI, a third party manufacturer, to supply the nebulizer that is used for ARIKAYCE. Any disruption in supply of the nebulizer will have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent upon PARI being able to provide an adequate supply of nebulizers both for our clinical trials and for commercial sale in the event ARIKAYCE receives marketing approval. These nebulizers must be in good working order, meet specific performance characteristics and be approved by FDA and other regulatory agencies along with ARIKAYCE. We have no alternative supplier for the nebulizer and we do not intend to seek an alternative or secondary supplier of nebulizers. Significant effort and time were expended in the optimization of the nebulizer for use with ARIKAYCE. In the event PARI cannot provide devices, replication of the optimized device by another party may require considerable time and additional regulatory approval. In the case of certain defined supply failures, we will have the right under the PARI Agreement to make the Device and have it made by third parties, but not certain third parties deemed under the PARI Agreement to compete with PARI. PARI has the right to terminate this agreement upon written notice for our uncured material breach, or if we are the subject of specified bankruptcy or liquidation events. In the event PARI terminates the supply agreement and ceases to manufacture the nebulizer, we cannot be certain that we would be able identify another willing supplier for the nebulizer on terms we require. A disruption in the supply of nebulizers could delay, impair, or prevent the development and commercialization of our products and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe rely on Ajinomoto Althea, Inc. and Therapure, third party manufacturers, to supply ARIKAYCE. Any disruption in the supply of ARIKAYCE could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent upon Ajinomoto Althea, Inc. (\"Althea\") to provide an adequate supply of ARIKAYCE both for our clinical trials and for commercial sale in the event ARIKAYCE receives marketing approval. In September 2015, we entered into a Commercial Fill/Finish Services Agreement with Althea to produce ARIKAYCE. Althea has the right to terminate this agreement upon written notice for our uncured material breach, if we are the subject of specified bankruptcy or liquidation events, or without cause with 24 months' prior written notice. In the event Althea terminates the supply agreement and ceases to supply ARIKAYCE, we cannot be certain that we would be able to identify another willing supplier for ARIKAYCE on terms we require or that are favorable to us. A disruption in the supply of ARIKAYCE could delay, impair, or prevent clinical trials, the development and commercialization of ARIKAYCE and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAlthea currently manufactures ARIKAYCE at a relatively small scale. In order to meet potential commercial demand, if ARIKAYCE is approved, we have constructed a manufacturing operation at Therapure in Canada as an alternate site of manufacture that operates at a larger scale. We may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for ARIKAYCE produced at Therapure's facility. We may not be able to secure an alternative source of ARIKAYCE at an adequate scale of production. An inadequate supply of ARIKAYCE could delay, impair, or prevent clinical trials, the development and commercialization of ARIKAYCE and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe currently depend on third parties to conduct the operations of our clinical trials.\nWe rely on third parties, such as CROs like Synteract, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to oversee some of the operations of our clinical trials and to perform data collection and analysis. As a result, we may face additional delays outside of our control if these parties do not perform their obligations in a timely fashion or in accordance with regulatory requirements. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations and meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons, our financial results and the commercial prospects for ARIKAYCE or our other potential product candidates could be materially harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales could be delayed.\nWe also rely on third parties to select and enter into agreements with clinical investigators to conduct clinical trials to support approval of our products and the failure of these third parties to carry out such evaluation and selection can adversely affect the quality of the data from these studies and, potentially, the approval of our products. In particular, as part of our new drug approval submissions, we must disclose any financial interests of investigators who participated in any of the clinical studies being submitted in support of approval, or must certify to the absence of such financial interests. FDA evaluates the information contained in such disclosures to determine whether disclosed interests may have an impact on the reliability of a study. If FDA determines that financial interests of any clinical investigator raise serious questions of data integrity, FDA can institute a data audit, request that we submit further data analyses, conduct additional independent studies to confirm the results of the questioned study, or refuse to use the data from the questioned study as a basis for approval. A finding by FDA that a financial relationship of an investigator raises serious questions of data integrity, could delay or otherwise adversely affect approval of our products.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have a history of operating losses. We expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe are a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the unmet needs of patients with rare diseases. We have incurred losses each previous year of our operation, except in 2009, when we sold our manufacturing facility and certain other assets to Merck. We expect to continue incurring operating losses for the foreseeable future. The process of developing and commercializing our products requires significant pre-clinical and clinical testing as well as regulatory approvals for commercialization and marketing before we are allowed to begin product sales. In addition, commercialization of our drug candidates likely would require us to significantly expand our sales and marketing organization and establish contractual relationships to enable product manufacturing and other related activities. We expect that our activities, together with our general and administrative expenses, will continue to result in substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2015, our accumulated deficit was $589.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our consolidated net loss was $118.2 million.\nTo achieve and maintain profitability, we need to generate significant revenues from future product sales. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including:\n\u00b7 Successfully completing development of and obtaining regulatory approval for the marketing of ARIKAYCE and possibly other product candidates which have yet to be developed and which would also require marketing approval;\n\u00b7 Commercializing ARIKAYCE and any other product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval; and \u00b7 Achieving market acceptance and reimbursement of ARIKAYCE and any other product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval in the medical community and with patients and third-party payers.\nARIKAYCE will require marketing approval and significant investment in commercial capabilities, including manufacturing and sales and marketing efforts, before its product sales can generate any revenues for us. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development and commercialization, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses. We may never successfully commercialize ARIKAYCE or any other products, generate significant future revenues or achieve and sustain profitability.\nWe expect that we will need additional funds in the future to continue our operations, but we face uncertainties with respect to our ability to access capital.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since our inception. We expect to continue to incur substantial research and development expenses, and we expect to expend substantial financial resources to complete development of, seek regulatory approval for, and prepare for commercialization of ARIKAYCE. We may need to seek additional funding in order to complete any clinical trials related to ARIKAYCE, seek regulatory approvals of ARIKAYCE, and commercially launch ARIKAYCE. We also may require additional future capital in order to continue our other research and development activities or to fund corporate development. As of December 31, 2015, we had $282.9 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. If adequate funds are not available to us when needed, we may be required to reduce or eliminate research and development programs or commercial efforts.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including factors associated with:\n\u00b7 Phase 3 clinical trials and commercialization of ARIKAYCE; \u00b7 Early access programs; \u00b7 Non-clinical and clinical testing; \u00b7 Process development and scale up for manufacturing; \u00b7 Manufacturing for clinical trials and commercial demand; \u00b7 Performance of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers; \u00b7 Obtaining marketing, sales and distribution capabilities; \u00b7 Obtaining regulatory approvals; \u00b7 Research and development, including formulation development; \u00b7 Retaining employees and consultants; \u00b7 Global expansion efforts; \u00b7 Filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing and defending patent claims; \u00b7 Establishing strategic alliances and collaborations with third-parties; and \u00b7 Potential future litigation.\nWe also may need to spend more funds than currently expected because we may further change or alter drug development plans, acquire additional drugs or drug candidates or we may misjudge our costs. As of December 31, 2015, we had no committed sources of capital and do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed, or, if available, that the terms will be favorable. We cannot assure that our cash reserves together with any subsequent funding will be sufficient for our capital requirements. The failure to satisfy our capital requirements will adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may seek additional funding through strategic alliances, private or public sales of our securities, debt financing or licensing all or a portion of our technology or through other means. Such funding may significantly dilute existing shareholders, subject us to contractual restrictions such as operating or financial covenants or limit our rights to our technology.\nWe currently have no meaningful source of revenue.\nIn 2015 and 2014, we generated no meaningful revenue. In 2013, we generated other revenue from the modification of a previously granted license of our IPLEX technology to Premacure. Unless we can execute one or more revenue generating transactions or successfully obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize ARIKAYCE, we will have no material sources of operating revenue. We expect to continue to incur substantial additional operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue to develop and seek to commercialize ARIKAYCE.\nIf we are not successful in our efforts to evaluate potential future IPLEX initiatives and to identify and engage in possible out-licensing opportunities for IPLEX, we may not derive any future revenues from IPLEX.\nIPLEX is no longer a development priority for us. We no longer have protein development capability or the in-house capability to manufacture IPLEX. Accordingly, we continue to evaluate possible out-licensing opportunities for IPLEX. We may have difficulty identifying possible markets, and securing prospective partners for out-licensing, including as a result of certain opt-in and other rights retained by Ipsen and Genentech related to future development of IPLEX pursuant to the patent infringement settlement agreement among us, Ipsen and Genentech. Even if we are able to enter into out-licensing arrangements, we may not derive any revenue from those arrangements.\nOur loan agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. (\"Hercules\") contains covenants that impose restrictions on our operations that may adversely affect our ability to optimally operate our business or to maximize shareholder value.\nOur loan agreement with Hercules contains various restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, transfer or place a lien or security interest on our assets, including our intellectual property, merge with or acquire other companies, redeem or repurchase any shares of our capital stock or pay cash dividends to our stockholders. The loan agreement also contains certain other covenants (including limitations on other indebtedness, liens, acquisitions, investments and dividends), and events of default (including payment defaults, breaches of covenants following any applicable cure period, a material impairment in the perfection or priority of the lender's security interest or in the collateral, and events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency). Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 5% may be applied to the outstanding loan balances, and the lender may terminate its lending commitment, declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable, and take such other actions as set forth in the Loan Agreement. In addition, pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the lender has the right to participate, in an amount of up to $1.0 million, in certain future private equity financing(s).\nUnder our loan agreement with Hercules, we have borrowed $25.0 million as of December 31, 2015, bearing interest of 9.25%. In December 2015, we completed an amendment of our loan agreement by exercising an option to extend the maturity date to January 1, 2018 with a payment to Hercules of $250,000. The amendment extend the interest-only period, with principal repayments beginning in October 2016. Our borrowings under the Loan Agreement are secured by a lien on our assets, excluding our intellectual property, and in the event of a default on the loan, the lender may have the right to seize our assets securing our obligations under the Loan Agreement. The terms and restrictions provided for in the Loan Agreement may inhibit our ability to conduct our business and to\nprovide distributions to our stockholders. Future debt securities or other financing arrangements could contain negative covenants similar to, or even more restrictive than, the Hercules loan.\nIn process research and development (IPRD) currently comprises approximately 16% of our total assets. A reduction in the value of our IPRD could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of the merger with Transave in 2010 we recorded an intangible IPRD asset of $77.9 million and goodwill of $6.3 million on our balance sheet. As a result of our clinical hold announced in late 2011 we recorded a charge of $26.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and reduced the value of IPRD to $58.2 million and reduced goodwill to zero. Other potential future activities or results could result in additional write-downs of IPRD, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to use our net operating losses.\nWe have substantial tax loss carry forwards for US federal income tax purposes and beginning in 2015, we have tax losses in Ireland as well. Our ability to fully use certain US tax loss carry forwards prior to December 2010 to offset future income or tax liability was limited under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Changes in the ownership of our stock, including those resulting from the issuance of shares of our common stock upon exercise of outstanding options, may limit or eliminate our ability to use certain net operating losses in the future.\nAny acquisitions we make, or collaborative relationships we enter into, may require a significant amount of our available cash and may not be scientifically or commercially successful.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may effect acquisitions to obtain additional businesses, products, technologies, capabilities and personnel. Nonetheless, we cannot assure you that we will identify suitable products or enter into such acquisitions on acceptable terms. If we make one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration includes cash, we may be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash and/or need to raise additional capital.\nAcquisitions involve a number of operational risks, including:\n\u00b7 failure to achieve expected synergies; \u00b7 difficulty and expense of assimilating the operations, technology and personnel of the acquired business; \u00b7 our inability to retain the management, key personnel and other employees of the acquired business; \u00b7 our inability to maintain the acquired company's relationship with key third parties, such as alliance partners; \u00b7 exposure to legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to the acquisition; \u00b7 the diversion of our management's attention from our core business; and\u00b7 the potential impairment of goodwill and write-off of in-process research and development costs, adversely affecting our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also may enter into collaborative relationships that would involve our collaborators conducting proprietary development programs. Any conflict with our collaborators could limit our ability to obtain future collaboration agreements and negatively influence our relationship with existing collaborators. Disagreements with collaborators may also develop over the rights to our intellectual property.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nWe may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for ARIKAYCE or any other products we develop in the US, Europe or other countries. If we fail to obtain such approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our products.\nWe are required to obtain various regulatory approvals prior to studying our products in humans and then again before we market and distribute our products. The regulatory review and approval processes in both the US and Europe require evaluation of preclinical studies and clinical studies, as well as the evaluation of our manufacturing process. These processes are complex, lengthy, expensive, resource intensive and uncertain. Securing regulatory approval to market our products requires the submission of much more extensive preclinical and clinical data, manufacturing information regarding the process and facility, scientific data characterizing our product and other supporting data to the regulatory authorities in order to establish its safety and effectiveness. This process also is complex, lengthy, expensive, resource intensive and uncertain. We have limited experience in submitting and pursuing applications necessary to gain these regulatory approvals.\nData submitted to the regulators is subject to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory agency approval. We may also encounter delays or rejections based on changes in regulatory agency policies during the period in which we develop a product and the period required for review of any application for regulatory agency approval of a particular product. For example, FDA has designated ARIKAYCE for Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and QIDP status, all programs intended to expedite or streamline the development and regulatory review of the drug. If we were to lose the current designation under one or more of those programs, we could face delays in the FDA review and approval process. Even with these designations, there is no guarantee we will receive approval for ARIKAYCE on a timely basis, or at all.\nThe Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act established incentives for the development of new therapies for serious and life-threatening infections by making streamlined priority review and fast track processes available for drugs which the FDA designates as QIDPs. To qualify for designation as a QIDP according to the criteria established in the GAIN Act a product must be an antibacterial or anti-fungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including: those caused by an anti-fungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens; or caused by qualifying pathogens listed by the FDA in accordance with the GAIN Act. Under the fast track program generally, the sponsor of an IND may request FDA to designate the drug candidate as a fast track drug if it is intended to treat a serious condition and fulfill an unmet medical need. FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor's request. Once FDA designates a drug as a fast track candidate, it is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of that drug by providing more frequent communication with and guidance to the sponsor.\nDelays in obtaining regulatory agency approvals could adversely affect the development and marketing of any drugs that we or any third parties develop. Resolving such delays could force us or third parties to incur significant costs, could limit our allowed activities or the allowed activities of third parties, could diminish any competitive advantages that we or our third parties may attain or could adversely affect our ability to receive royalties, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nTo market our products outside of the US and, Europe, we and any potential third parties must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries. The approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and administrative review\nperiods. The time required to obtain approval in these other territories might differ from that required to obtain FDA or EMA approval. The regulatory approval process in these other territories includes at least all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA and EMA approval detailed above.\nSpecifically related to INS1009, we believe that this product could be eligible for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Like a traditional NDA that is submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA, a 505(b)(2) NDA must establish that the drug is safe and effective, but unlike a traditional NDA the applicant may rely at least in part on studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant does not have a right of reference. The ability to rely on existing data to support safety and/or effectiveness can reduce the time and cost associated with traditional NDAs. We cannot be sure that we will obtain approval for INS1009 under the 505(b)(2) pathway.\nApproval by the FDA or the EMA does not ensure approval by the regulatory authorities of other countries. Marketing approval in one country does not ensure marketing approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining marketing approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. In addition, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution if we fail to comply with applicable US and foreign regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or to obtain and maintain required approvals, our target market may be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates may be harmed. The failure to obtain such approvals may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and our prospects.\nThere is little or no precedent for clinical development and regulatory expectations for agents to treat NTM; as a result we may encounter challenges developing clinical endpoints that will ultimately be satisfactory to regulators, and may need to reevaluate our surrogate endpoints at various points in time.\nFDA may base accelerated approval for drugs for serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need on whether the drug has an effect on a surrogate or an intermediate clinical endpoint (other than survival or irreversible morbidity). FDA regulations referred to as \"Subpart H-Accelerated Approval of New Drugs for Serious or Life-Threatening Illnesses\" describe the potential use of surrogate endpoints. A surrogate endpoint used for accelerated approval is a marker-a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Likewise, an intermediate clinical endpoint is a measure of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on irreversible morbidity and mortality. The FDA bases its decision on whether to accept the proposed surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint on the scientific support for that endpoint. Studies that demonstrate a drug's effect on a surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint must be \"adequate and well controlled\" as required by the FD&C Act.\nIf a drug is approved based on a surrogate endpoint under Subpart H the approval will be subject to the requirement that the applicant study the drug further, to verify and describe its clinical benefit, where there is uncertainty as to the relation of the surrogate endpoint to clinical benefit, or of the observed clinical benefit to the ultimate outcome. Post marketing studies would usually be studies already underway. When required to be conducted, such studies must also be adequate and well-controlled. The applicant shall carry out any such studies with due diligence. Developing clinical endpoints that are unsatisfactory to regulators could delay clinical trials and the FDA approval process which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and our prospects.\nIn addition, even if we are successful in obtaining accelerated approval in the US or under comparable pathways in other jurisdictions, we may face requirements and limitations that will adversely affect our commercial prospects. For example, we may not successfully complete required post-approval trials, or such trials may not confirm the clinical benefit of our drug, and we may be required to withdraw approval of the drug.\nFor ARIKAYCE to be successfully developed and commercialized, in addition to regulatory approvals required for ARIKAYCE, the eFlow nebulizer system must satisfy certain regulatory requirements and its use as a delivery system for ARIKAYCE must be approved for use in any market in which we intend to commercialize ARIKAYCE.\nAlthough the optimized eFlow Nebulizer System is CE marked by PARI in Europe, outside Europe it is labeled as investigational for use in our clinical trials in the US, Canada, Australia and Japan. The optimized eFlow Nebulizer System is not approved for commercial use in the US, Canada or certain other markets in which we may choose to commercialize ARIKAYCE if approved. The eFlow Nebulizer System must receive regulatory approval before we can market ARIKAYCE. We will continue to work closely with PARI to coordinate efforts regarding regulatory requirements, including our proposed filings for a drug and device. However, we or PARI may not be successful in meeting the regulatory requirements for the eFlow Nebulizer System, which could prevent or hinder our ability to bring ARIKAYCE to market or market it successfully.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for ARIKAYCE or any of our other product candidates, we will continue to face extensive regulatory requirements and our products may face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if marketing approval in the US is obtained, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product's indicated uses or marketing, including risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or may impose ongoing requirements on us, including with respect to:\n\u00b7 Labeling, such as black box or other warnings or contraindications; \u00b7 Post-market surveillance, post-market studies or post-market clinical trials; \u00b7 Packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information; \u00b7 Monitoring and reporting adverse events and instances of the failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA; \u00b7 Changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process; \u00b7 Advertising and other promotional material; and \u00b7 Disclosure of clinical trial results on publicly available databases.\nIn addition, the third-party manufacturers of our products and their facilities are and will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. The distribution, sale and marketing of our products are subject to a number of additional requirements, including:\n\u00b7 State wholesale drug distribution laws and the distribution of our product samples to physicians must comply with the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act; \u00b7 Sales, marketing and scientific or educational grant programs must comply with the anti-kickback and fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the transparency provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and an associated reconciliation bill that became law in March 2010, which we refer to collectively as the Health Care Reform Law, federal and state patient privacy laws, the False Claims Act and similar state laws; and\n\u00b7 Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veteran's Health Care Act of 1992, and if products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply.\nAll of these activities also may be subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.\nWe also are subject to changes or revisions to these laws and regulations that may make gaining regulatory approval, reimbursement and pricing more difficult or at least subject to different criteria and standards.\nIf we or any third party involved in our manufacturing or commercialization efforts fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u00b7 Issue warning letters or untitled letters asserting that we are in violation of the law; \u00b7 Seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines; \u00b7 Suspend or withdraw marketing approval; \u00b7 Suspend any ongoing clinical trials; \u00b7 Refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications submitted by us; \u00b7 Suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; \u00b7 Seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall; \u00b7 Refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts; \u00b7 Impose civil monetary penalties; or \u00b7 Pursue civil or criminal prosecutions and fines against our company or responsible officers.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response, and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenues.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for ARIKAYCE or any of our other product candidates, adverse effects discovered after approval could limit the commercial profile of any approved product.\nIf we obtain marketing approval for ARIKAYCE or any other product candidate that we develop, such products will be used by a larger number of patients and for longer periods of time than they were used in clinical trials. For these reasons or other reasons, we or others may later discover that our products have adverse effect profiles that limit their usefulness or require their withdrawal. This discovery could have a number of potentially significant negative consequences, including:\n\u00b7 Regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product and may require recall of product in distribution; \u00b7 Regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as black box or other warnings or contraindications; \u00b7 Regulatory authorities may require us to issue specific communications to healthcare professionals, such as \"Dear Doctor Letters;\" \u00b7 Regulatory authorities may impose additional restrictions on marketing and distribution of the products, or other risk management measures;\n\u00b7 Regulatory authorities may issue negative publicity regarding the product, including safety communications; \u00b7 We may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical studies or restrict the distribution of the product; \u00b7 We could be sued and held liable for harm caused to subjects; \u00b7 We could be subject to negative publicity; and \u00b7 Our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from maintaining market acceptance of the affected product, could cause substantial reduction of sales, could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates, and could cause significant financial losses.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from governments or third-party payers for ARIKAYCE or any other products that we may develop or if we are unable to obtain acceptable prices for those products, our prospects for generating revenue and achieving profitability may be materially adversely affected.\nOur prospects for generating revenue and achieving profitability depend heavily upon the availability of adequate reimbursement for the use of our approved product candidates from governmental and other third-party payers, both in the US and in other markets. Reimbursement by a third party payer may depend upon a number of factors, including the third party payer's determination that use of a product is:\n\u00b7 A covered benefit under its health plan; \u00b7 Safe, effective and medically necessary; \u00b7 Appropriate for the specific patient; \u00b7 Cost-effective; and \u00b7 Neither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining reimbursement approval for a product from each government or other third-party payer is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of our products to each payer. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to reimbursement or we might need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any future products to such payers' satisfaction. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. Even when a payer determines that a product is eligible for reimbursement, the payer may impose coverage limitations that preclude payment for some uses that are approved by the FDA or non-US regulatory authorities. In addition, there is a risk that full reimbursement may not be available for high priced products. Moreover, eligibility for coverage does not imply that any product will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that allows us to make a profit or even cover our costs. Interim payments for new products, if applicable, also may not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Subsequent approvals of competitive products could result in a detrimental change to the reimbursement of our products.\nThere is a significant focus in the US healthcare industry and elsewhere on cost containment and value. We expect changes in the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs, as well as managed care organizations and other third-party payers to continue to put pressure on pharmaceutical product pricing in return for near-term cost effectiveness or budget impact. In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare outpatient prescription drug coverage for the elderly through Part D prescription drug plans sponsored by private entities. The legislation authorized such plans to use formularies where they can limit the\nnumber of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. The plans generally negotiate significant price concessions as a condition of formulary placement. The MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs, which is generally believed to have resulted in lower Medicare reimbursement for physician-administered drugs. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation provide additional pressure to contain and reduce drug prices and could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business. Although the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations when setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reimbursement reduction resulting from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, which was intended to broaden access to health insurance, constrain and reduce the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms, was passed into law. Effective in October 2010, the PPACA revised the definition of \"average manufacturer price\" for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, beginning in 2011, the law imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. We do not know the full effects that the PPACA will have on our commercialization efforts but we believe it is likely that the law will continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and also may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. If one or more of our product candidates reaches commercialization, such changes may have a significant impact on our ability to set a price we believe is fair for our products and may adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability. We expect further federal and state proposals and health care reforms to continue to be proposed by legislators, which could limit the prices that can be charged for the products we develop and may limit our commercial opportunity.\nMoreover, in markets outside the US, including Japan, Canada and the countries in the EU, pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. Evaluation criteria used by many EU government agencies for the purposes of pricing and reimbursement typically focus on a product's degree of innovation and its ability to meet a clinical need unfulfilled by currently available therapies. The PPACA created a similar entity, the Patient- Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) designed to review the effectiveness of treatments and medications in federally-funded health care programs. The PCORI began its first research initiatives recently, and an adverse result may result in a treatment or product being removed from Medicare or Medicare coverage. The decisions of such governmental agencies could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nGovernment health care reform could increase our costs, and could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nOur industry is highly regulated and changes in law may adversely impact our business, operations or financial results. Substantial new requirements affecting compliance were enacted as part of the PPACA, which may require us to modify our business practices with health care practitioners. For example, drug manufacturers are required to report information on payments or transfers of value to US physicians and teaching hospitals as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. The reported data is posted in searchable form on a public website. Some state laws also prohibit certain gifts to health care providers, require pharmaceutical companies to report payments to health care professionals, and/or require companies to adopt compliance programs or codes of conduct. In addition, other countries, including France, require the disclosure of certain payments to health care professionals.\nThe reforms imposed by the PPACA significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry; however, the full effects cannot be known until these provisions are fully implemented and CMS and other federal and state agencies all issue applicable regulations or guidance. Moreover, in the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products or product candidates. We will continue to evaluate the PPACA, as amended, the implementation of regulations or guidance related to various provisions of the PPACA by federal agencies, as well as trends and changes that may be encouraged by the legislation and that may potentially have an impact on our business over time. The cost of implementing more detailed record keeping systems and otherwise complying with these requirements could substantially increase our costs.\nWe will need approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside the US for our proposed trade names. Any failure or delay associated with such approvals may delay the commercialization of our products.\nAny trade name we intend to use for our product candidates will require approval from the FDA regardless of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the US Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO. The FDA typically conducts a rigorous review of proposed trade names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other trade names and medication error. The FDA also may object to a trade name if it believes the name is inappropriately promotional. The FDA preliminarily approved our use of the name ARIKAYCE as our proposed trade name for our liposomal amikacin for inhalation product candidate. Even after the FDA approves a trade name, the FDA may request that we adopt an alternative name for the product if adverse event reports indicate a potential for confusion with other trade names and medication error. If we are required to adopt an alternative name, the commercialization of ARIKAYCE could be delayed or interrupted, which would limit our ability to commercialize ARIKAYCE and generate revenues. In December 2012, we learned that the EMA had no objection to our request to use the name ARIKAYCE.\nIf we are found in violation of federal or state \"fraud and abuse\" laws, we may be required to pay a penalty or may be suspended from participation in federal or state health care programs, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the US, we are subject to various federal and state health care \"fraud and abuse\" laws, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws and other laws intended to reduce fraud and abuse in federal and state health care programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order or prescription of a particular drug for which payment may be made under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Under federal government regulations, some arrangements, known as safe harbors, are deemed not to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although we seek to structure our business arrangements in compliance with all applicable requirements, these laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how the law will be applied in specific circumstances. Accordingly, it is possible that our practices may be challenged under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willfully presenting or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers, including government payers, claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services that were not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Cases have been brought under false claims laws alleging that off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products or the provision of kickbacks has caused health care providers to submit false claims to governmental health care programs when they prescribe drugs or fill prescriptions for off-label purposes. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, we are prohibited from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program,\nincluding private payers, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines or exclusion or suspension from federal and state health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the US government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states.\nMany states have adopted laws similar to the federal anti-kickback statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for health care services reimbursed by any source, not just governmental payers. In addition, California and a few other states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. Health record privacy laws may limit access to information identifying those individuals who may be prospective users or prohibit contact with any persons enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements, and we could be subject to penalties if a state determines that we have failed to comply with an applicable state law requirement.\nNeither the government nor the courts have provided definitive guidance on the application of fraud and abuse laws to our business. Law enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing these laws, and it is possible that some of our practices may be challenged under these laws. While we believe we have structured our business arrangements to comply with these laws, it is possible that the government could allege violations of, or convict us of violating, these laws. If we are found in violation of one of these laws, we could be required to pay a penalty and could be suspended or excluded from participation in federal or state health care programs, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, the value of our product candidates could be diminished.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to protect proprietary technology and to obtain patent protection for our products, prevent third parties from infringing on our patents and refrain from infringing on the patents of others, both domestically and internationally.\nIn addition, the patent situation in the field of biotechnology and pharmaceuticals generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal, technical, scientific and factual questions. We intend to actively pursue patent protection for products resulting from our research and development activities that have significant potential commercial value. We may not be able to obtain additional issued patents relating to our technology or products.\nEven if issued, patents issued to us or our licensors may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, held to be unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or reduce the term of patent protection we may have for our products. We cannot assure you that any patents obtained will afford us adequate protection or provide us with any meaningful competitive advantages against these competitors.\nUS patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference or derivation proceedings, and US patents may be subject to re-examination proceedings, reissue, post-grant review and/or inter partes review in the USPTO. Foreign patents may be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent office, which could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. In addition, such interference, derivation, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review and opposition proceedings may be costly.\nChanges in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. For example, the America Invents Act was signed into law in the United States in September 2011, with phased implementation through March 2013, and includes a number of changes to established practices. These include the transition to a first-inventor-to-file system, establishment of new procedures for challenging patents and implementation of different methods for invalidating patents. We cannot predict the impact that new laws, government rule-making, implementing regulations and applicable case law may have on the strength of our patents. Certain reforms may make it easier for competitors to challenge our patents and could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. In addition, any patents we procure may require cooperation with companies holding related patents and we may have difficulty forming a successful relationship with such other companies.\nIf we are not able to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information, the value of our product candidates could be significantly diminished.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technologies, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors, collaborators, and other third parties and partners to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information or may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, third parties may independently develop or discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. For example, the FDA, as part of its Transparency Initiative is considering whether to make additional information publicly available on a routine basis, including information that we may consider to be trade secrets or other proprietary information, and it is not clear at the present time whether and how the FDA's disclosure policies may change in the future. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and any failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to life sciences. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or in-licensed patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be required to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and to enforce intellectual property rights.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nIn order to protect our proprietary technology and processes, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers and other advisors. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information. Costly and time- consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our ability to successfully compete in the industry.\nWe may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay our product development efforts, prevent us from commercializing our products or increase the costs of commercializing our products.\nThird parties may claim that we have infringed upon or misappropriated their proprietary rights. Third parties may attempt to obtain patent protection relating to the production and use of our product candidates. We cannot assure you that any existing third-party patents, or patents that may later issue to third parties, would not negatively affect our commercialization of ARIKAYCE, INS1009 or any other product. We cannot assure you that such patents can be avoided or invalidated or would be licensed to us at commercially reasonable rates or at all. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in any intellectual property litigation that may arise or that such litigation would not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation or prospects. In the event of a successful claim against us for infringement or misappropriation of a third party's proprietary rights, we may be required to take actions including but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7 Pay damages, including up to treble damages, and the other party's attorneys' fees, which may be substantial; \u00b7 Cease the development, manufacture, marketing and sale of products or use of processes that infringe the proprietary rights of others; \u00b7 Expend significant resources to redesign our products or our processes so that they do not infringe the proprietary rights of others, which may not be possible; \u00b7 Redesign our products or processes to avoid third-party proprietary rights, which means we may suffer significant regulatory delays associated with conducting additional clinical trials or other steps to obtain regulatory approval; and/or \u00b7 Obtain one or more licenses arising out of a settlement of litigation or otherwise from third parties which license(s) may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nFurthermore, litigation with any third party, even if the allegations are without merit, would likely be expensive and time-consuming and divert management's attention.\nIn particular, PAH is a competitive indication with established products, including other formulations of treprostinil. Our supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for INS1009 is dependent upon a single supplier. The supplier owns patents on its manufacturing process and we have filed patent applications for INS1009. A competitor in the PAH indication may claim that we or our\nsupplier have infringed upon or misappropriated their proprietary rights. We cannot be sure that we or our supplier will be successful in any intellectual property litigation that may arise or that such litigation would not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation or prospects.\nAny lawsuits relating to infringement of intellectual property rights necessary to defend ourselves or enforce our rights may be costly and time consuming.\nAny conclusions we may have reached regarding non-infringement, inapplicability or invalidity of a third party's intellectual property are based in significant part on a review of publicly available databases and other information. There may be information not available to us or otherwise not reviewed by us that could change our conclusions. Moreover, the scope and validity of patent claims depend significantly on facts and circumstances, and a court's conclusions as to these matters may differ from the conclusions that we have reached.\nWe may have to undertake costly litigation to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to confirm the scope and validity of another party's proprietary rights. We cannot assure you that a court would not invalidate our issued or licensed intellectual property. An adverse outcome in litigation or interference or other proceeding in any court or patent office could materially adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our license agreements for our product candidates, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe currently have a licensing agreement with PARI for use of the optimized eFlow Nebulizer System for delivery of ARIKAYCE in treating patients with NTM infections. We have rights to several US and foreign issued patents, and patent applications involving improvements to the optimized eFlow Nebulizer System. Under the licensing agreement, PARI is entitled to receive payments either in cash, qualified stock or a combination of both, at PARI's discretion, based on achievement of certain milestone events including phase 3 trial initiation, first acceptance of MAA submission (or equivalent) in the US of ARIKAYCE and the device, first receipt of marketing approval in the US for ARIKAYCE and the device, and first receipt of marketing approval in a major EU country for ARIKAYCE and the device. There can be no assurance that the foregoing milestone events will be achieved and therefore there can be no assurance that we will make any future payments. We have certain obligations under this licensing agreement in relation to specified licensed indications. With respect to CF, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory and reimbursement approval, market and sell ARIKAYCE in two or more major European countries. With respect to NTM, CF and bronchiectasis, we have specific obligations to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve certain developmental and regulatory milestones by set deadlines. Additionally, for NTM, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve certain commercial milestones in the US, Europe and Canada. The consequences of our failing to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve certain commercial milestones are context-specific, but include ending PARI's non-compete obligation, making the license non-exclusive and terminating the license, in each case with respect to the applicable indication. Termination of the licensing agreement or loss of exclusive rights may occur if we fail to meet our obligations, including payment of royalties to PARI, or if we do not meet certain milestones contained in the licensing agreement such as obtaining marketing approval or achieving the first commercial sale of ARIKAYCE.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe operate in a highly competitive and changing environment, and if we are unable to adapt to our environment, we may be unable to compete successfully.\nBiotechnology and related pharmaceutical technology have undergone and are likely to continue to experience rapid and significant change. We expect that the technologies associated with biotechnology research and development will continue to develop rapidly. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies and to obtain and maintain protection for our intellectual property. Any compounds, products or processes that we develop may become obsolete before we recover any expenses incurred in connection with their development. Rapid technological change could make our products obsolete, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nWe expect that successful competition will depend, among other things, on product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, timing and scope of regulatory approval and price. Specifically, we expect crucial factors will include the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the clinical testing and regulatory approval processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market. We expect competition to increase as technological advances are made and commercial applications broaden.\nIn each of our potential product areas, we face substantial competition from pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies, universities and research institutions. Relative to us, most of these entities have substantially greater capital resources, research and development staffs, facilities and experience in conducting clinical studies and obtaining regulatory approvals, as well as in manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. Many of our competitors may achieve product commercialization or patent protection earlier than us. Furthermore, we believe that our competitors have used, and may continue to use, litigation to gain a competitive advantage. Finally, our competitors may use different technologies or approaches to the development of products similar to the products we are seeking to develop. We cannot assure you that if ARIKAYCE is approved for NTM that it will be able to compete successfully in the marketplace.\nCompetitors could develop and obtain FDA or other regulatory approval of products containing amikacin, which could adversely affect our competitive position in all ARIKAYCE-related indications.\nIn the event there are other amikacin products approved by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for any use, physicians may elect to prescribe those products rather than ARIKAYCE to treat the indications for which ARIKAYCE may receive approval, which is commonly referred to as off-label use. Although regulations prohibit a drug company from promoting off-label use of its product, the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate the practice of medicine and as a result cannot direct physicians as to what product to prescribe to their patients. As a result, we would have limited ability to prevent any off-label use of a competitor's product to treat diseases for which we have received FDA or other regulatory agency approval, even if such use violates our patents or orphan drug exclusivity for the use of amikacin to treat such diseases. This could negatively affect our results of operations or business.\nCompetitors could develop and obtain FDA or other regulatory approval of antibiotic products that are more effective, safer, tolerable or more convenient or less expensive than our products in development or existing products, which could adversely affect our competitive position in all ARIKAYCE-related indications.\nThere are potential competitive products, both approved and in development, which include oral, systemic, or inhaled antibiotic products to treat chronic respiratory infections. If any of our competitors develops a product that is more effective, safer, tolerable or, convenient or less expensive than ARIKAYCE, it would adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. We also may face lower priced generic competitors if third-party payers encourage use of generic or lower-priced versions of our product or if competing products are imported into the US or other countries where we may sell ARIKAYCE.\nIf another party obtains orphan drug exclusivity for a product that is essentially the same as a product we are developing for a particular indication, we may be precluded or delayed from commercializing the product in that indication.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition. See \"Business-Government Regulation-Orphan Drugs-United States.\" The company that obtains the first marketing approval from the FDA for a designated orphan drug for a rare disease receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the designated condition for a period of seven years. Similar laws exist in EU with a term of ten years. See \"Business-Government Regulation-Orphan Drugs-Europe.\" If a competitor obtains approval of the same drug for the same indication or disease before us, we would be prohibited from obtaining approval for our product for seven or more years, unless our product can be shown to be clinically superior. In addition, more than one drug may be approved by the FDA for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the drugs are different drugs. As a result, even if one of our products is approved and receives orphan drug exclusivity, the FDA may approve different drugs for use in treating the same indication or disease covered by our product, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nIf we obtain orphan exclusivity for a product, the FDA may approve another product during our orphan exclusivity period for the same indication under certain circumstances.\nThe Orphan Drug Act was created to encourage companies to develop therapies for rare diseases by providing incentives for drug development and commercialization. One of the incentives provided by the act is seven years of market exclusivity in the United States for the first product in a class licensed for the treatment of a rare disease. Orphan exclusivity will not, however, bar approval of another product under certain circumstances. One such circumstance is if a product with the same active ingredient is proven safe and effective for a different indication. Another circumstance is if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care. FDA may also approve another product with the same active ingredient and the same indication if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. As a result, even if one of our product candidates receives orphan exclusivity, the FDA can still approve other drugs that have a different active ingredient for use in treating the same indication or disease. All of the above circumstances could create a more competitive market for us.\nOur research, development and manufacturing activities used in the production of ARIKAYCE involve the use of hazardous materials, which could expose us to damages and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our research and development program and manufacturing activities for ARIKAYCE involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. Although we believe we are in compliance with all pertinent regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of environmental contamination, damage to facilities or injury to personnel from the accidental or improper use or control of these materials. In addition to any liability we could have for any misuse by us of hazardous materials and chemicals, we could also potentially be liable for activities of our contract manufacturers or other third parties. Any such liability, or even claims of such liability, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims, and we have only limited product liability insurance.\nThe manufacture and sale of human therapeutic products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity. We currently have only limited product liability insurance for our products. We do not know if we will be able to maintain existing or obtain additional product liability insurance on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. This type of insurance is expensive and may not be available on acceptable terms. If we are unable to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we may be unable to commercialize our products. A successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage, if any, may require us to pay substantial amounts and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nWe are dependent upon retaining and attracting key personnel, the loss of whose services could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe depend highly on the principal members of our scientific and management personnel, the loss of whose services might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our research, development or business objectives. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified management, scientific and medical personnel, and on our ability to develop and maintain important relationships with commercial partners, leading research institutions and key distributors. We will need to hire additional personnel in anticipation of seeking regulatory approval for and commercial launch of ARIKAYCE.\nCompetition for skilled personnel in our industry and market is very intense because of the numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that seek similar personnel. These companies may have greater financial and other resources, offer a greater opportunity for career advancement and\nhave a longer history in the industry than we do. We also experience competition for the hiring of our scientific and clinical personnel from universities, research institutions, and other third parties. We cannot assure that we will attract and retain such persons or maintain such relationships.\nOur inability to retain and attract qualified employees would harm our business.\nWe expect to expand our development, manufacturing, regulatory and future sales and marketing capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe expect that our potential expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise, such as further clinical trials, governmental approvals, manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution will place additional requirements on our management, operational and financial resources. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees.\nThe anticipated commercialization of ARIKAYCE and the development of additional product candidates will require significant expenditures by us and place a strain on our resources. If our management is unable to effectively manage our activities in anticipation of commercialization, as well as our development efforts, we may incur higher than expected expenditures or other expenses and our business may otherwise be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock and Listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market\nThe market price of our stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol INSM. The market price of our stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile, and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors may include:\n\u00b7 Our listing status on the Nasdaq Global Select Market; \u00b7 Results of our clinical studies and preclinical studies, or those of our corporate partners or our competitors; \u00b7 Delays in timing of pre-clinical, clinical development and regulatory filings and delays regarding our inability to obtain potential approvals; \u00b7 Strategic business decisions; \u00b7 Developments in our relationships with corporate partners; \u00b7 Developments affecting our corporate partners; \u00b7 Negative regulatory action or regulatory approval with respect to our announcement or our competitors' announcements of new products; \u00b7 Government regulation, reimbursement changes and governmental investigation or audits related to us or to our products; \u00b7 Developments related to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors; \u00b7 Other competitive developments; \u00b7 Reports issued by and changes in the position of securities analysts with respect to our stock or changes in stock ownership by investors;\n\u00b7 Operating results below the expectations of securities analysts and investors; and \u00b7 The need or perceived need to raise additional capital.\nIn addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have particularly affected the market prices for emerging biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like us, and which have often been unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nHistorically, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, shareholders are more likely to institute securities and derivative class action litigation against the issuer of such stock. If any of our shareholders were to institute a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Any lawsuit could divert the time and attention of our management.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, or the possibility of such sales occurring, could also adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock or our future ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities.\nThe sale of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock. The market price for our common stock could also decline, perhaps significantly, as a result of issuances of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market or even the perception that such issuances could occur.\nIf we fail to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market, which may cause the value of an investment in our common stock to decrease.\nIf a delisting from the Nasdaq Global Select Market were to occur, our common stock may be eligible, upon the application of a market maker, to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board or in the \"pink sheets.\" These alternative markets are generally considered to be less efficient than, and not as broad as, the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Therefore, delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Global Select Market could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and could limit the liquidity of our common stock and therefore could cause the value of an investment in our common stock to decrease.\nThe ownership interest of existing shareholders will be diluted by the exercise of options issued by us or to the extent that we issue additional common stock in connection with any offerings of securities, strategic transactions, or otherwise.\nAs of December 31, 2015, 5.3 million shares of our common stock are potentially issuable under outstanding restricted stock units and stock options to our employees, officers, directors and consultants.\nThe conversion or exercise of some or all of our restricted stock units and options will dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion or exercise could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nAdditionally, our Articles of Incorporation currently authorize us to issue up to 500 million common shares. As of December 31, 2015 we had 61.8 million shares of common stock outstanding. To the extent that we issue additional common stock in connection with any offerings of securities,\nstrategic transactions, or otherwise, the ownership interest of existing shareholders will be further diluted.\nHistorically we have not paid dividends on our common stock, and we have no plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain any future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.\nCertain provisions of Virginia law and our articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could hamper a third party's acquisition of, or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us.\nCertain provisions of Virginia law and our articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could hamper a third party's acquisition of, or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 A provision allowing us to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without any further vote or action by the holders of the common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of the common stock. In certain circumstances, such issuance could have the effect of decreasing the market price of the common stock; \u00b7 The existence of a staggered board of directors in which there are three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms, thus expanding the time required to change the composition of a majority of directors and perhaps discouraging someone from making an acquisition proposal for us; \u00b7 Our amended and restated bylaws' requirement that shareholders provide advance notice when nominating director candidates to serve on our Board of Directors; \u00b7 The inability of shareholders to convene a shareholders' meeting without the chairman of the board, the president or a majority of the board of directors first calling the meeting; and \u00b7 The application of Virginia law prohibiting us from entering into a business combination with the beneficial owner of 10% or more of our outstanding voting stock for a period of three years after the 10% or greater owner first reached that level of stock ownership, unless we meet certain criteria.\nIn addition, we previously had a \"poison pill\" shareholder rights plan, which expired in May 2011. Under Virginia law, our Board of Directors may implement a new shareholders rights plan without shareholder approval. Our Board of Directors intends to regularly consider this matter, even in the absence of specific circumstances or takeover proposals, to facilitate its future ability to quickly and effectively protect shareholder value.\nOther Risks Related to our Business\nCorporate governance and public disclosure requirements add uncertainty to our compliance policies and increase our costs of compliance.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to accounting, corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, other SEC regulations, and the Nasdaq Global Select Market rules, are creating uncertainty for companies like ours. These laws, regulations and standards may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations. Their application in practice may evolve over time, as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of ongoing revisions to such corporate governance standards.\nIn particular, our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors' audit of our internal control over financial reporting requires the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. We consistently assess the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting, remediate any control deficiencies that may be identified, and validate through testing that our controls are functioning as documented. While we do not anticipate any material weaknesses, the inability of management and our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. For example, in connection with our review of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, we determined that we did not adequately implement certain controls over the administration, accounting and oversight of our 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, and we concluded that a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting existed as of December 31, 2012. The existence of this or one or more other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements, and substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify any internal control deficiencies. Any material weaknesses may materially adversely affect our ability to report accurately our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and reliable manner. In addition, although we continually review and evaluate internal control systems to allow management to report on the sufficiency of our internal controls, we cannot assure you that we will not discover weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Any such weakness or failure to remediate a material weakness could materially adversely affect our ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements and the requirements of our various agreements.\nWe are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, and our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards in this regard have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. In addition, the laws, regulations and standards regarding corporate governance may make it more difficult for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. Further, our board members, chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with their performance of duties. As a result, we may face difficulties attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers, which could harm our business. If we fail to comply with new or changed laws, regulations or standards of corporate governance, our business and reputation may be harmed.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our business operations, including our drug development programs.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material adverse effect on our business operations, including a material disruption of our drug development programs. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data, whether through breach of computer systems, systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or otherwise, could damage our reputation. Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems and networks, whether by our employees or third parties, could result in negative publicity, legal liability and damage to our reputation. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for any of our drug candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our drug candidates could be delayed.\nAlthough we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that our coverage will cover all claims, continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be sufficient in amount to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed or are not covered by our insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws or trade control laws, as well as other laws governing our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business. The FCPA, UK Bribery Act and these other laws generally prohibit us, our employees and our intermediaries making prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. We operate in jurisdictions that pose a risk of potential FCPA violations, and we participate in joint ventures and relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject us to liability under the FCPA or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security, the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control, and various non-U.S. government entities, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements, currency exchange regulations and transfer pricing regulations (collectively, the \"Trade Control laws\").\nThere is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anticorruption laws, including the FCPA or other legal requirements, including Trade Control laws. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA other anti- corruption laws or Trade Control laws by U.S. or foreign authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 88351, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "INSM"}
