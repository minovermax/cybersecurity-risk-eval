You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report, before you decide whether to purchase our common stock. These factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the general or specific risks that may affect us. It should be recognized that other risks may be significant, presently or in the future, and the risks set forth below may affect us to a greater extent than indicated. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you many lose all or part of your investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS AND INDUSTRY\nChanges in our relationships with significant clients, including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe depend on a small number of clients for a substantial portion of our business. For the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's 10 largest clients accounted for approximately 52% and 57% of consolidated net revenue, respectively. One Supply Chain client accounted for approximately 16% and 17% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021and 2020, respectively and one Direct Marketing client, accounted for 11% and 8% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021and 2020, respectively. No other clients accounted for greater than 10% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020.\nIn general, the Company does not have any agreements which obligate any client to buy a material amount of services from it or designate it as an exclusive service provider. Consequently, the Company's net revenue is subject to demand variability by our clients. The level and timing of orders placed by the Company's clients vary for a variety of reasons, including seasonal buying by end-users, the introduction of new technologies and general economic conditions. Changes in relationships with significant clients may require us to evaluate our goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment, which may require us to record an impairment charge. Decreases in client demand or volumes or loss of business from one or more of these clients could have a materially adverse impact on our businesses, financial condition or results from operations. For more information, see \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies.\u201d\nIf the demand for direct mail marketing services or supply chain management services decline, or if we are unable or do not effectively integrate new or emerging marketing industry trends into our services and offerings, our revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCustomer traffic and demand for our direct mail marketing solutions and supply chain management services may be influenced by changing consumer demands and industry trends. Although direct mail remains a critical piece of our customers\u2019 marketing spend, some of our competitors may expend more for their programs than we do, or use different approaches than we do, which may provide them with a competitive advantage. Furthermore, we may not effectively develop or implement strategies with respect to rapidly evolving industry trends, including direct marketing or digital communication channels and outsourcing supply chain management services, among other business practices. If our marketing efforts are not as successful or cost-effective as anticipated, our revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may have difficulty achieving and sustaining operating profitability, and if that depletes our working capital balances, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nFor the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, we reported an operating loss of $12.8 million and operating income of $32.4 million, respectively. Although we have reduced our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue (a key focus of our restructuring activities is to reduce operating costs), we anticipate that we will continue to incur significant fixed operating expenses in the future within both cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses. Therefore, since our revenue is subject to fluctuations, there can be no assurance that we will achieve or sustain operating income in the future. We may also use significant amounts of cash in an effort to increase the efficiency and profitability of our business. Our consolidated working capital deficit was $4.6 million at July 31, 2021. If we are unable to achieve or sustain operating profitability, we risk depleting our working capital balances, and our business could be materially adversely affected.\nBecause most of our contracts do not contain minimum purchase requirements and we sell primarily on a purchase order basis, we are subject to uncertainties and variability in demand by clients, which could decrease revenue materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur contracts generally do not include material minimum purchase requirements, and we sell primarily on a purchase order basis. Therefore, our sales are subject to unpredictable variability by our clients and have fluctuated historically. These fluctuations may continue, sometimes materially, from year to year and even from quarter to quarter. The level and timing of orders placed by these clients vary for a variety of reasons, including seasonal buying by end-users of Supply Chain customers, as well as individual client strategies, the introduction of new technologies, the desire of our clients to reduce their exposure to any single supplier and general economic conditions impacting both of our operating segments. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demands of our clients, we may lose clients because we have an inadequate supply of their products or insufficient capacity at our sites, or alternatively, we may have excess inventory or excess capacity, either of which may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results.\nA decline in our key business sectors or a reduction in consumer demand generally could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nA large portion of our Supply Chain business revenue comes from clients in the technology and consumer products sectors, which is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes. A reduction or interruption in supply, including disruptions\non our global supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or a significant natural disaster (including as a result of climate change) or from supply chain issues, a failure to appropriately cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs, or a decrease in demand for our services could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships. There is currently a market shortage of semiconductor and other electrical component supplies, which has affected, and could further affect, our Supply Chain clients in the computing and consumer electrical markets and, consequently, their demand for our offerings. We expect these supply chain challenges to continue through at least the first half of fiscal 2022 and potentially into the second half of fiscal 2022 or later. During periods of component shortages for our clients, we may also encounter reduced client demand, and accordingly, our revenue and profitability could suffer until other component sources can be developed.\nA large portion of our Direct Marketing business revenue is generated from clients in the insurance, MSO, financial services and subscription services products sectors, which may be subject to fluctuations in overall economic conditions. In addition, industry changes, such as the increasing use of digital over physical marketing capabilities and the dissemination of promotional and marketing materials through evolving digital channels, could lessen the demand for certain of our services we currently provide. Declines in the overall performance of the technology and consumer products sectors have in the past and could in the future adversely affect the demand for supply chain management services and reduce our revenue and profitability from these clients. The recent uncertainty in the economy and other factors have resulted in decreased demand for our clients' products and reduction in demand for our marketing solutions, which have had an adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to pose risks, to our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The spread of the outbreak has caused significant disruptions in the U.S. and global economies, and the impact may continue to be significant during the rest of the calendar year and potentially beyond. The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company continues to evaluate the global risks and the slowdown in business activity related to COVID-19, including the potential impacts on its employees, customers, suppliers and financial results. For the fiscal year 2020, COVID-19 required temporary closures of certain of ModusLink's facilities. Additionally, although IWCO Direct operated as an essential business, it had reduced operating levels and labor shifts due to lower sales volume.\nThe Company's results of operations, including sales volume, were adversely affected by COVID-19 during the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic or other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases could materially adversely impact the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in several ways. In particular, the continued spread of COVID-19 and efforts to contain the virus could:\n\u2022impair the Company's ability to manage day-to-day service and product delivery;\n\u2022continue to impact customer demand of our businesses' products and services;\n\u2022cause disruptions in or closures of the Company's operations or those of its customers and suppliers (as of the filing of this Form 10-K, all of the Company's facilities were open and able to operate at normal capacities);\n\u2022cause the Company to experience an increase in costs as a result of the Company's emergency measures, delayed payments from customers and uncollectible accounts;\n\u2022cause delays and disruptions in the supply chain resulting in disruptions in the commercial operation of our businesses;\n\u2022cause limitations on the Company's employees' ability to work and travel;\n\u2022impact availability of qualified personnel;\n\u2022increase cybersecurity risks as remote working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks, including phishing and social engineering attempts that seek to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022cause other unpredictable events.\nAs the situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid, it is difficult to predict the duration of the pandemic and the impact on the Company's business, operations, financial condition and cash flows. The severity of the impact on the Company's business in fiscal 2022 will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic (including the advent of variants and the impact of vaccination on infection and hospitalization rates), the extent and severity of the impact on the Company's customers and suppliers, the continued disruption to the manufacturing of and demand for our businesses' products and services, the effect of federal, state or local regulations regarding safety measures to address the spread of COVID-19, and the impact of the global business and economic environment on liquidity and the availability of capital, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. Due to the evolving and uncertain nature of this event, the Company cannot predict at this time the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely impact the Company's business,\nresults and financial condition, which will depend on many factors that are not known at this time. The Company is staying in close communication with its employees, customers and suppliers, and acting to mitigate the impact of this dynamic and evolving situation, but there is no guarantee the Company will be able to do so.\nOur business sectors are subject to intense competition.\nThe markets for our services are highly competitive and often lack significant barriers to entry enabling new businesses to enter these markets relatively easily. Numerous well-established companies and smaller entrepreneurial companies are focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that will compete with our offerings. The market for supply chain management products and services, as well as marketing solutions, is very competitive, and the intensity of the competition is expected to continue to increase. For more information, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Competition.\u201d Any failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position would limit our ability to maintain and increase market share, which could result in serious harm to our business. Increased competition may also result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors will continue to have greater financial, technical, operational and marketing resources. We may not be able to compete successfully against these competitors. Competitive pressures may also force prices for our products and services down, and these price reductions may reduce our revenue. The competition we face may also increase as a result of consolidation within the supply chain management and logistics, and marketing solutions industries. For example, if as a result of consolidation, our competitors are able to obtain more favorable terms from their suppliers, offer more comprehensive services to their customers, or otherwise take actions that increase their competitive strengths, our competitive position and therefore our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nOur operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, causing volatility in the price of our common stock.\nOur annual and quarterly operating results have fluctuated widely during the last several years and may continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022how well we execute on our overall strategy and operating plans;\n\u2022implementation of our strategic initiatives and achievement of expected results of these initiatives;\n\u2022demand for our services;\n\u2022consumer confidence and demand;\n\u2022specific economic conditions in the industries in which we compete;\n\u2022competitive disruptions or innovations affecting the services or products we provide;\n\u2022general economic and financial market conditions;\n\u2022timing of new product introductions or software releases by our clients or their competitors;\n\u2022payment of costs associated with our acquisitions, sales of assets and investments;\n\u2022market acceptance of new products and services;\n\u2022seasonality;\n\u2022temporary shortages in supply from vendors;\n\u2022charges for impairment of long-lived assets, including restructuring in future periods;\n\u2022political instability, including changes in tariff laws or natural disasters in the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022actual events, circumstances, outcomes and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions and estimates reflected in our accompanying consolidated financial statements;\n\u2022changes in accounting rules;\n\u2022changes in tax rules and regulations;\n\u2022changes in labor laws;\n\u2022availability of labor resources and the variability of available rates for labor resources;\n\u2022unionization of our labor and contract labor; and\n\u2022implementation of automation.\nWe believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations will not necessarily be meaningful or indicative of our future performance. In some fiscal quarters, our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline, severely impairing or eliminating the value of your investment. In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Technical factors in the public trading market for our common stock may produce price movements that may or may not comport with macro, industry or company-specific fundamentals, including, without limitation, the sentiment of retail investors (including as may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites), the amount and status of short interest in our securities,\naccess to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on our common stock and any related hedging or other technical trading factors. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and may cause a significant increase in the premium paid for our directors and officers insurance.\nThe funds held for clients may be subject to credit risk, impairment, misappropriation or theft, and any such incident could result in harm to our clients and damage to our brand.\nIn the normal course of our business, we, at times, collect, process and/or retain client funds. The client funds are maintained at financial institutions both internationally and domestically, and the balances associated with these funds are at times without or in excess of federally insurable limits. Because such funds may not be fully protected, they could be vulnerable to external or internal unauthorized access or use, which may cause such funds to be impaired, misappropriated or stolen. Any impairment, misappropriation or theft of client funds could damage our reputation, expose us to mitigation costs and the risks of private litigation and government enforcement, disrupt our business and otherwise have a materially adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. In addition, our failure to respond quickly and appropriately to any impairment, misappropriation or theft of client funds could exacerbate the consequences to the client and to our business, as well as increase the time or cost necessary to mitigate or resolve the issue.\nWe must maintain adequate levels of inventory in order to meet client needs, which presents risks to our financial position and operating results.\nWe must purchase and maintain adequate levels of inventory (including adequate levels of paper inventory used by IWCO Direct) in order to meet client needs on a timely basis. The markets, including the technology sector served by many of our clients, are subject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced product specification requirements, and evolving industry standards. These changes may cause inventory on hand to decline substantially in value or to rapidly become obsolete. The majority of our clients in the Supply Chain business offer protection from the loss in value of inventory. However, our clients may become unable or unwilling to fulfill their protection obligations, and the inability of our clients to do so could lower our gross margins and cause us to record inventory write-downs. In our Direct Marketing business, our clients typically do not provide such price protection. If we are unable to manage the inventory on hand with our clients with a high degree of precision, we may have insufficient product supplies to meet demand or we may have excess inventory, resulting in inventory write-downs, which may harm our business, financial position and operating results.\nOur ability to obtain particular products or components in the quantities required to fulfill client orders on a timely basis is critical to our success. We have no guaranteed price or delivery agreements with our suppliers. We may occasionally experience a supply shortage of some products as a result of strong demand or problems experienced by our suppliers. If shortages or delays persist, the price of those products may increase, or the products may not be available at all. Accordingly, an inability to secure and maintain an adequate supply of products, packaging materials or components to fulfill our client orders on a timely basis, or a failure to meet clients' expectations, could result in lost revenue, lower client satisfaction, negative perceptions in the marketplace, potential claims for damages and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may have problems raising or accessing capital we need in the future.\nIn recent years, we have financed our operations and met our capital requirements primarily through funds generated from operations, the sale of our securities, borrowings from lending institutions and sale of Company owned facilities that were not being fully utilized. These funding sources may not be sufficient in the future and we may need to obtain additional funding from outside sources; however, we may not be able to obtain such funding. In addition, even if we obtain outside funding sources, we may be required to issue to those outside sources securities with greater rights than those currently possessed by holders of our common stock. We may also be required to take other actions, which may lessen the value of our common stock or dilute our common stockholders, including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to us or issuing additional shares of common stock. If we experience difficulties raising needed capital in the future, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, market and other conditions largely beyond our control may affect our ability to engage in future sales of our securities, the timing of any such sales and the amount of proceeds we receive. Even if we are able to sell our securities in the future, we may not be able to sell at favorable prices or on favorable terms. As long as our public float is less than $75 million, we will be limited in selling our securities on a short-form registration statement on Form S-3 to offerings that do not exceed one-third of our public float in a rolling 12-month period. Therefore, the process of raising capital to support our growth may be\nmore expensive and time consuming, including the use of a registration statement on Form S-1, and the terms of any offering transaction may not be as favorable as they would have been if we were eligible to use Form S-3 without these restrictions. In addition to entailing increased capital costs, any such transactions could result in substantial dilution of our stockholders' interests, transfer control to a new investor and/or diminish the value of an investment in our common stock.\nWe may also need to pursue strategic transactions, such as joint ventures, private placements or the sale of our business or all or substantially all of our assets. These private financings and strategic transactions could in the future require significant management attention, disrupt our business, adversely affect our financial results, be unsuccessful or fail to achieve the desired results. We are in discussions from time to time with such possible sources of additional funding.\nIf financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by the conditions of the U.S. and international capital markets, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to borrow funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate purposes.\nWe may encounter problems in our efforts to increase operational efficiencies.\nBecause the markets in which we operate are highly competitive, we continue to seek to identify ways to increase efficiencies and productivity and effect cost savings. IWCO Direct and ModusLink are continually employing programs to achieve efficiencies, which include investment in capital equipment and automation. We cannot assure you that these projects and capital investments will result in the realization of the expected benefits that we anticipate in a timely manner or at all. We may encounter problems with these projects that will divert the attention of management and/or result in additional costs and unforeseen project delays. If we, or these projects, do not achieve expected results, our business, financial position and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. In addition to already undertaken projects in our Supply Chain business designed to increase our operational efficiencies, including the standardization to a global solutions platform through an integrated ERP system and the implementation of a model utilizing centralized \"hub\" locations to service multiple \"spoke\" locations across the Americas, Asia and Europe regions, our executive team is continuing its review across the organization designed to improve our operations.\nLoss of essential employees or an inability to recruit and retain personnel could have a significant negative impact on our business.\nOur success is largely dependent on the skills, experience, and efforts of our management and other employees. The loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management or of numerous employees with essential skills could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are not able to retain or attract talented, committed individuals to fill vacant positions when needs arise, it may adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. We do not currently maintain \"key persons\" insurance on our senior management. In particular, IWCO Direct's production operations are dependent upon attracting and retaining skilled and unskilled employees to take advantage of all available manufacturing capacity and ensure on-time delivery of clients' marketing programs to meet service level agreements (SLAs) without penalty. IWCO Direct's future success depends on its continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and promote personnel for all areas of its organization. Also, IWCO Direct's sales executives, the majority of which have at least 10 years' industry experience, are focused on specific industry verticals leveraging their expertise to drive clients marketing results. Labor market conditions may have an adverse impact on profitability and ability to deliver product on time. Any material increases in employee turnover rates could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans or they may adversely affect our business.\nOn June 2, 2021, the Board approved a Competitive Improvement Plan (\u201cCIP\u201d) for IWCO Direct, which addresses the changing requirements of its customers and markets it serves, as well as the current competitive landscape. The CIP seeks to expand IWCO Direct\u2019s marketing services capabilities, and upgrade its production platform to new digital and inserting technology, while reducing its overall production costs to enhance its competitive pricing capabilities. The CIP contemplates a total investment of approximately $54 million primarily over a 24-month period. The Company estimates the CIP cost will consist of approximately: (1) $38 million for digital press and insertion equipment, and technology build out cost (of which approximately $34 million in lease/purchase agreements were entered into subsequent to year-end), and (2) $16 million for severance, employee retention, facilities optimization, and other implementation costs. In addition, the Company expects to incur approximately $12 million for non-cash accelerated depreciation expense. The cost estimates do not include amounts for\npotential non-cash asset impairment charges relating to facilities and equipment optimization. The timing and amount of the costs will depend on a number of factors.\nFrom time to time we implement restructuring plans like the CIP above to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies to reduce our costs; however, we may not be able to obtain the costs savings and benefits that we initially anticipated in connection with these restructuring plans. While our restructuring plans are designed to deliver long-term sustainable growth, these plans present significant potential risks that may impair our ability to achieving our anticipated operating results and/or cost reductions, including:\n\u2022loss of business continuity and accumulated knowledge;\n\u2022inefficiencies to our operations during any necessary transitional periods;\n\u2022realization of estimated productivity improvements may be fewer than expected;\n\u2022facilities optimization costs may be higher than anticipated;\n\u2022the financial resources we are able to expend to conduct necessary operations or otherwise capitalize on our other business opportunities may be insufficient;\n\u2022costs in implementing planned workforce reductions may be higher than anticipated and could have a significant impact on our earnings and cash flows;\n\u2022benefits may be realized later than expected, and difficulties in implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated, which may cause us to incur additional costs or result in disruptions to our business; and\n\u2022management and employee attention and resources may be diverted from our ongoing business activities, there may be attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce, and/or employee morale may decrease.\nOur success in implementing our restructuring plans will depend on our ability to continue to meet customer demand and maintain a high level of quality through the transition. If we are not successful in implementing and managing our restructuring plans, we may not achieve the anticipated sales growth and/or cost savings or we may incur costs materially in excess of the contemplated costs, all of which could adversely impact our business, financial position and operating results.\nWe may not be able to identify, manage, complete and integrate acquisitions and achieve anticipated synergies and benefits.\nPart of our business strategy is to acquire businesses that we believe can complement our current business activities, both financially and strategically. Acquisitions involve many complexities and inherent risk, including, but not limited to: failure to achieve all or any projected synergies or other intended benefits of the acquisition; failure to integrate the purchased operations, technologies, products or services; substantial unanticipated integration costs; loss of key employees, including those of the acquired business; additional debt and/or assumption of unknown liabilities; loss of customers; and the impact on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As a result, there is no guarantee that our acquisitions will increase the profitability and cash flow of the Company, and our efforts could cause unforeseen complexities and additional cash outflows, including financial losses.\nThe Supply Chain business conducts business outside of the U.S., which exposes the Company to additional risks not typically associated with companies that operate solely within the U.S.\nThe majority of ModusLink's operations are in foreign countries, including Mainland China, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Ireland and Singapore. These operations have additional risks, including currency exchange, foreign exchange controls, difficulties and limitations on the repatriation of cash, less developed or efficient financial markets than in the U.S., absence of uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, differences in the legal and regulatory environment, different publicly available information in respect of companies in non-U.S. markets, economic and political risks, and possible imposition of non-U.S. taxes. There can be no assurance that adverse developments with respect to such risks will not adversely affect our operations in certain countries.\nModusLink also faces several risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions foreign exchange controls, U.S. laws such as export control laws and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar laws in other countries which also prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers. Given the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently breached. Also, we may be held liable for actions taken by our local partners. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries.\nOur business in Mainland China faces certain specific risks, including the following:\n\u2022the challenge of navigating a complex set of licensing and tax requirements and restrictions affecting the conduct of business in Mainland China by foreign companies;\n\u2022protection of intellectual and physical property, both for us and our clients;\n\u2022evolving regulatory systems and standards, including recent tax law and labor law changes; and\n\u2022difficulty retaining management personnel and skilled employees.\nMoreover, ModusLink\u2019s ability to operate in Mainland China may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. and Chinese laws and regulations such as those related to, among other things, taxation, intellectual property, currency controls, network security, employee benefits and other matters. Furthermore, any third parties we rely on in Mainland China may disclose our confidential information or intellectual property to competitors or third parties, which could result in the illegal distribution and sale of counterfeit versions of our products. If any of these events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe physical or intellectual property of our clients may be damaged, misappropriated, stolen or lost while in our possession, subjecting us to potential litigation and other adverse consequences.\nIn the course of providing supply chain management services to our clients, we often have possession of or access to their physical and intellectual property, including consigned inventory, databases, software masters, certificates of authenticity and similar valuable physical or intellectual property. If this physical or intellectual property is damaged, misappropriated, stolen or lost, we could suffer: claims under client agreements or applicable law, or other liability for damages; delayed or lost revenue due to adverse client reaction; negative publicity; and litigation that could be costly and time consuming and which may not be reimbursable by third party insurance coverages.\nA significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our technology systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on information and operational technology systems in the conduct of our business to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. In some cases, we may rely upon third-party providers of hosting, support and other services to meet our information technology requirements. We also collect and store sensitive data, including confidential business information and personal data. Upgrading our information technology systems is costly and subject to delay, and there is no assurance new systems will provide the benefits expected. We may also experience operational problems attributable to the installation, implementation, integration, performance, features or functionality of third-party software, systems and services.\nIn addition, our information and operational technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, worms or other malicious software programs, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters, defects in design, employee malfeasance, and human or technological errors. Cybersecurity incidents in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, use of malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or control of automated production systems, and other security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Various procedures and controls to monitor, deter and mitigate these threats have been implemented. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of technology security incidents and disruptions, our businesses could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, theft, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition, reputation or results of operations. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience actual or attempted cyber-attacks of our information technology systems or networks, yet none of these actual or attempted cyber-attacks has had a material effect on our operations or financial condition. Further, any failure by our hosting and support partners or other third-party service providers in the performance of their services could materially harm our business. While we try to maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage that we believe is adequate for our business, such coverage may not cover all potential costs and expenses associated with any security incidents that may occur or may not be available at a reasonable cost in the marketplace in the future.\nA breach of our information technology systems could also result in the misappropriation of intellectual property, business plans or trade secrets. Any failure of our systems or those of our third-party service providers could result in unauthorized access or acquisition of proprietary information. Any actual or perceived security breach could cause significant damage to our reputation, expose us to liability or regulatory enforcement action and adversely impact our relationships with our customers or vendors. Additionally, while our security systems are designed to maintain the physical security of our\nfacilities and information systems, accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access by third parties to our facilities or our information systems could lead to misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information.\nIf any person, including any of our employees or those with whom we share such information, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to our client, customer or employee data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. State and federal laws may also require us to provide notice to affected individuals if their personal data is the subject of a security breach, which would impose costs and could lead to additional liability and negative publicity.\nWe take cybersecurity and data privacy seriously and devote significant resources and tools to protect our systems, products and data and to prevent unwanted intrusions and disclosures, in compliance with applicable U.S. federal and state laws and non-U.S. laws and regulations addressing cybersecurity and data privacy. In particular, we have put in place policies and procedures to address the European General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect in January 2020. However, these security and compliance efforts are costly to implement and may not be successful. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent, detect and adequately address or mitigate all cyber-attacks or security breaches. Any such breach could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our reputation and could cause irreparable damage to us or our systems, regardless of whether we or our third-party providers are able to adequately recover critical systems following a systems failure.\nLitigation pending against us could materially impact our business and results of operations.\nWe are currently a party to various legal and other proceedings. See Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of this Form 10-K. Trends in litigation may include class actions involving consumers, shareholders or employees, and claims relating to commercial, labor, employment, antitrust, securities or environmental matters. Litigation trends and the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could result in material damages and/or other expenses, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We can provide no assurances as to the outcome of any litigation\nRISKS RELATED TO TAXATION\nWe may be unable to realize the benefits of our net operating loss carry-forwards and other tax benefits (collectively, \"NOLs\" or \"Tax Benefits\").\nOur past operations generated significant NOLs. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which among, other things, amends the treatment of NOLs. Under federal tax laws, for NOLs arising in tax years beginning before January 1, 2018, we generally can use any such NOLs and certain related tax credits to reduce ordinary income tax paid in our prior two tax years or on our future taxable income for up to 20 years, at which point they expire for such purposes. Until they expire, we can carry forward NOLs and certain related tax credits that we do not use in any particular year to offset taxable income in future years. For NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021, we are allowed to carryback such NOLs to each of the five taxable years preceding the taxable year of such losses and generally can use any such NOLs and certain related tax credits to reduce ordinary income tax paid on our future taxable income indefinitely; however, except for NOLs generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and prior to January 1, 2021 (which can be carried back to reduce taxable income for the prior five tax years), any such NOLs cannot be used to reduce ordinary income tax paid in prior tax years. In addition, the deduction for NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020 is limited to 80 percent of our taxable income for any tax year (computed without regard to the NOL deduction). NOLs arising in tax years beginning before January 1, 2018, are referred to herein as \"Current NOLs.\" The Company had net NOL carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately $2.1 billion and $111.0 million, respectively, at July 31, 2021, substantially all of which arose in tax years ending before January 1, 2018, While we cannot estimate the exact amount of NOLs that we will be able use to reduce future income tax liability because we cannot predict the amount and timing of our future taxable income.\nOur ability to utilize our NOLs to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an \"ownership change,\" as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\" or \"Internal Revenue Code\"). Under Section 382, an \"ownership change\" occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders that each owns (or is deemed to own) at least 5% of our common stock increases their aggregate ownership by more than 50 percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 would impose an annual limit on the amount of our NOLs that we can use to offset taxable income equal to the product of the total value of our outstanding equity immediately prior to the ownership change (reduced by certain items specified in Section 382) and the\nfederal long-term tax-exempt interest rate in effect for the month of the ownership change. Several complex rules apply to calculating this annual limit.\nIf an ownership change is deemed to occur, the limitations imposed by Section 382 could significantly limit our ability to use our NOLs to reduce future income tax liability and result in a material amount of our Current NOLs expiring unused and, therefore, significantly impair the value of our NOLs. While the complexity of Section 382\u2019s provisions and the limited knowledge any public company has about the ownership of its publicly traded securities make it difficult to determine whether an ownership change has occurred, we currently believe that an ownership change has not occurred.\nOur ability to use our Current NOLs in future years will depend upon the amount of our federal and state taxable income. If we do not have sufficient federal and state taxable income in future years to use the Current NOLs before they expire, we will lose the benefit of the Current NOLs permanently. In addition to the generation of future federal and state taxable income, our ability to use our Current NOLs will depend significantly on our success in identifying suitable acquisition or investment candidates, and once identified, successfully consummating an acquisition of, or investment in these candidates. We have adopted an amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cProtective Amendment\u201d) and a tax benefit preservation plan (\u201cTax Plan\u201d), each designed to preserve our ability to utilize our NOLs, by preventing an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 that would impair our ability to utilize our NOLs. For more information, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Tax Benefits Preservation Plan.\u201d\nAlthough the Tax Plan is intended to diminish the likelihood of an ownership change, we cannot assure you that it will be effective. The amount by which an ownership interest may change in the future could, for example, be affected by purchases and sales of common stock by stockholders holding five percent or more of our outstanding common stock, over which we have no control, and new issuances of shares of common stock by us, should we choose to do so.\nThe amount of NOLs that we have claimed has not been audited or otherwise validated by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"). The IRS could challenge our calculation of the amount of our NOLs or our determinations as to when a prior change in ownership occurred, and other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to carry forward our NOLs to offset taxable income in future years. If the IRS was successful with respect to any such challenge, the potential tax benefit of the NOLs to us could be substantially reduced. In addition, determining whether an ownership change has occurred is subject to uncertainty, both because of the complexity and ambiguity of the Section 382 provisions and because of limitations on the knowledge that any publicly traded company can have about the ownership of, and transactions in, its securities on a timely basis. Therefore, we cannot assure you that the IRS or other taxing authority will not claim that we experienced an ownership change and attempt to reduce the benefit of the NOLs even if the Protective Amendment and Tax Plan are in place. Any of the above risks to our ability to use our NOLs could significantly impair our financial condition and materially adversely affect the value of your investment.\nThere may be adverse effects on the value of your investment from our use of the Protective Amendment and Tax Plan.\nThe Protective Amendment and Tax Plan are intended to deter persons or groups of persons from acquiring beneficial ownership of our Common Stock in excess of the specified limitations, as a way of preventing an \u201cownership change\u201d and protecting our ability to use our NOLs. For more information, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Tax Benefits Preservation Plan.\u201d Nonetheless, the Protective Amendment and Tax Plan may have an \u201canti-takeover effect\u201d because they may deter a person or group of persons from acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.99 percent or more of our outstanding common stock or, in the case of a person or group of persons that already own 4.99 percent or more of our outstanding common stock, from acquiring any additional common stock. The Protective Amendment and Tax Plan could discourage or prevent a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or accumulations of substantial blocks of shares of common stock.\nAdditionally, a stockholder\u2019s ability to dispose of our common stock may be limited if the Protective Amendment or Tax Plan reduces the number of persons willing to acquire our common stock or the amount they are willing to acquire. Thus, the Protective Amendment and Tax Plan could severely reduce liquidity of our common stock, negatively impacting the value of your investment. A stockholder may also become a greater than 4.99 percent stockholder upon actions taken by persons related to, or affiliated with, that stockholder. Stockholders are advised to carefully monitor their ownership of our common stock and consult their own legal advisors and/or us to determine whether their ownership of common stock approaches the proscribed level.\nWe are subject to federal, state and foreign tax audits, which could result in the imposition of liabilities that may or may not have been reserved, and changes in our provision for income taxes.\nWe are subject to audits by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions with respect to income taxes and for various other taxes, including but not limited to value added tax (\"VAT\"), excise tax, sales and use tax, gross receipts tax and property tax. These audits can cover periods for several years prior to the date the audit is undertaken and could result in the imposition of liabilities, interest and penalties if our positions are not accepted by the auditing tax authority.\nIn addition, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 38 countries, including the United States, has made changes and is contemplating additional changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes finalized and adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes.\nWe may be subject to state sales taxes that we have not paid, or collected from our customers or reserved for on our financial statements, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOn June 21, 2018, the United States Supreme Court rendered a decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. holding that a state may require a remote seller with no physical presence in the state to collect and remit sales tax on goods and services provided to purchasers in the state, overturning certain existing court precedent. We are evaluating our state tax filings with respect to the Wayfair decision and prior regulations, and are in the process of reviewing our collection practices. It is possible that one or more jurisdictions may assert that we have liability for periods for which we have not collected sales, use or other similar taxes and, if such an assertion or assertions were successful, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. One or more jurisdictions may change their laws or policies to apply their sales, use or other similar taxes to our operations and if such changes were made, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur failure to maintain compliance with Nasdaq's continued listing requirements could result in the delisting of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. In order to maintain this listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements. On April 28, 2020, we received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\"Nasdaq\") notifying the Company that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price of the Company's common stock has not been maintained at the minimum required closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share as required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market pursuant to Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) (the \"Minimum Bid Price Rule\"). On January 26, 2021, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq notifying it that it had regained full compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule, and that the matter was closed. From that date until July 31, 2021, the closing price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock fluctuated from a low of $1.68 to a high of $2.21. The Company's continued compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule is dependent on the Company's share price and there can be no assurance that Company will continue to satisfy Nasdaq's minimum financial and other requirements in future periods.\nThe perception among investors that the Company is at heightened risk of a deficiency under the Minimum Bid Price Rule and of subsequent delisting could negatively affect the market price of our securities and trading volume of the Company's common stock. Additionally, any delisting determination, if made following the notification of a deficiency and expiration of any applicable cure period, could seriously decrease or eliminate the value of an investment in the Company's common stock. While an alternative listing on an over-the-counter exchange could maintain some degree of a market in the Company's common stock, we could face substantial material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to: limited availability for market quotations for the Company's common stock; reduced liquidity with respect to the Company's common stock; a determination that the Company's common stock is a \"penny stock\" under SEC rules, subjecting brokers trading the Company's common stock to more stringent rules on disclosure and the class of investors to which the broker may sell the common stock; and limited news and analyst coverage.\nSPH Group Holdings LLC and its affiliates own a majority of the voting power of our capital stock and have significant influence over our corporate decisions.\nAs of October 1, 2021, SPH Group Holdings LLC (\"SPHG Holdings\") and its affiliates, including Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (\"Steel Holdings\"), Handy & Harman Ltd. and Steel Partners, Ltd., beneficially owned approximately 50.0% of our outstanding capital stock, including 17,857,143 shares of common stock underlying Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \"Series C Preferred Stock\"), which vote on an as-converted basis together with our common\nstock, and 6,293,707 shares of common stock underlying a 7.50% Convertible Senior Note due 2024, which do not vote on an as-converted basis together with our common stock. In addition, as of July 31, 2021, a Section 13(d) group made of SPHG Holdings and certain of its affiliates, collectively owned 54.8% of our outstanding capital stock, representing 51.3% of the voting power of our capital stock.\nAs a result of this board representation and ownership of our capital stock, SPHG Holdings and its affiliates are able to influence our management and affairs and many matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, the passage of a tax benefits preservation plan and certain amendments to our organizational documents. In addition, because a business combination, such as a merger or consolidation, requires the affirmative vote of 75% of our outstanding voting stock, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. SPHG Holdings and its affiliates may also have interests that are different from other shareholders and may vote in a way that may be adverse to our other stockholders' interests, conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, could arise between our interests and the interests of SPHG Holdings and its affiliates. See Note 21 for additional information.\nMembers of our Board also have significant interests in Steel Holdings and its affiliates, which may create conflicts of interest.\nSome members of our Board also hold positions with Steel Holdings and its affiliates. Specifically, Warren G. Lichtenstein, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of the Board, is affiliated with Steel Holdings and is the Executive Chairman of Steel Partners Holdings GP Inc. (\"Steel Holdings GP\"). Glen Kassan, our Vice Chairman of the Board and former Chief Administrative Officer, is an employee of Steel Services. Jack L. Howard, a director, is the President and a director of Steel Holdings GP. See our definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed on June 15, 2021 for full biographical information for Messrs. Lichtenstein, Kassan and Howard.\nAs a result, these individuals may face potential conflicts of interest with each other and with our stockholders. They may be presented with situations in their capacity as either an officer or as our directors that conflict with their fiduciary obligations to Steel Holdings and its affiliates, which in turn may have interests that conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. While our contractual arrangements place restrictions on the parties' conduct in certain situations and related party transactions are subject to independent review and approval in accordance with our related party transaction approval procedures and applicable law, the potential for a conflict of interest exists and such persons may have conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, with respect to matters involving or affecting SPHG Holdings and affiliates.\nThere can be no assurance that the proposed transaction between us and Steel Holdings will be agreed upon, approved and ultimately consummated and the terms of any such transaction may differ materially from those originally proposed by Steel Holdings.\nOn November 19, 2020, the Company's Board received a preliminary, non-binding expression of interest from Steel Holdings to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock not already owned by Steel Holdings or its affiliates for a combination of cash and Steel Holdings 6% Series A Preferred Units, which would imply a value per share of common stock in the range of $0.65 to $0.72 per share.\nThe transaction, as proposed, is subject to negotiation. Any definitive agreement with respect to such transaction is subject to approval by the board of directors of Steel Holdings, the Board and shareholders. Such definitive agreement would be expected to contain customary closing conditions, including standard regulatory notifications and approvals.\nAs a result, we cannot predict whether the terms of such transaction will be agreed upon by Steel Holdings and the Board's special committee for recommendation to their respective boards of directors, for approval of the transaction or whether any such transactions would be approved by the requisite votes of our shareholders.\nWe also cannot predict the timing, final structure or other terms of any potential transaction and the terms of any such transaction may differ materially from those originally proposed by Steel Holdings. The pendency of any such proposed transaction may have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. In addition, we expect to incur a number of non-recurring, transaction-related costs associated with negotiating the proposed transaction.\nOur Board may choose to effect a reverse split of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock at the ratio of one-for-ten, the effects of which we cannot predict with certainty and which may be materially adverse to the value of your investment in our common stock.\nAt our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved a reverse split of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock at the ratio of one-for-ten (the \u201cReverse Stock Split\u201d). Our board is authorized to determine when to file the necessary amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation for the Reverse Stock Split with the Delaware Secretary of State at any time on or before the 12-month anniversary of stockholder approval thereof. The board may, at its discretion, cause the filing of the amendment to effect the Reverse Stock Split or abandon the amendment and not effect the Reverse Stock Split if it determines that any such action is or is not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The board\u2019s decision as to whether and when to effect the Reverse Stock Split will be based on a number of factors, including market conditions, existing and expected trading prices for our common stock, and the Nasdaq Rules. Upon consummation of the Reverse Stock Split, every ten shares of common stock held by a stockholder at that time will be combined into one share of common stock. The Reverse Stock Split will affect all of our stockholders uniformly and will not affect any stockholder\u2019s percentage ownership interests in the Company or proportionate voting power, except for minor adjustments due to the treatment of fractional shares. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split.\nIf the Reverse Stock Split is implemented, our board expects that it will increase the market price of our common stock so that we are able to maintain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. However, the effect of the Reverse Stock Split upon the market price of our common stock cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the history of similar stock splits for companies in like circumstances is varied. It is possible that (i) the per share price of our common stock after the Reverse Stock Split will not rise in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding resulting from the Reverse Stock Split, (ii) the market price per post-Reverse Stock Split share may ultimately not exceed or remain in excess of the $1.00 minimum bid price for a sustained period of time, or (iii) the Reverse Stock Split may not result in a per share price that would attract brokers and investors who do not trade in lower priced stocks. In addition, if the Reverse Stock Split is implemented and the market price of our common stock declines, the percentage decline may be greater than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split. Furthermore, although our board believes that the decrease in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as a consequence of the Reverse Stock Split and the anticipated increase in the market price of our common stock could encourage interest in our common stock and possibly promote greater liquidity for our stockholders, such liquidity could also be adversely affected by the reduced number of shares outstanding after the Reverse Stock Split. The liquidity of our common stock may be harmed by the proposed Reverse Stock Split given the reduced number of shares of common stock that would be outstanding after the Reverse Stock Split, particularly if the stock price does not increase as a result of the Reverse Stock Split.\nAdditionally, at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders also approved the amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation to reduce the number of shares of authorized common stock (the \u201cAuthorized Shares Reduction\u201d), from 1,400,000,000 to 140,000,000. While our board currently intends to implement the Authorized Shares Reduction to the extent that it implements the Reverse Stock Split, our board reserves its right to elect not to proceed with the Authorized Shares Reduction if it determines, in its sole discretion, following stockholder approval, that this proposal is no longer in the best interests of the Company or its stockholders. Under these circumstances, the Reverse Stock Split could have an anti-takeover effect. A relative increase in the number of our authorized shares of common stock could enable the board to render more difficult or discourage an attempt by a party attempting to obtain control of the Company by tender offer or other means. The issuance of common stock in a public or private sale, merger or similar transaction would increase the number of outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote, increase the number of votes required to approve a change of control of the Company, and dilute the interest of a party attempting to obtain control of the Company. Any such issuance could deprive stockholders of benefits that could result from an attempt to obtain control of the Company, such as the realization of a premium over the market price that the attempt could cause. Moreover, the issuance of common stock to persons friendly to the board could make it more difficult to remove incumbent officers and directors from office even if the change were favorable to stockholders generally. However, this anti-takeover effect is not the purpose or intent of our board. Even if we were not to implement the Authorized Shares Reduction, we have no present intent to use the relative increase in the number of authorized but unissued shares of our common stock for anti-takeover purposes. We are not aware of any pending or threatened efforts to obtain control of the Company, and the board has no present intent to authorize the issuance of additional shares of common stock to discourage these efforts if they were to arise.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS\nAs of July 31, 2021, the carrying value of the debt outstanding was approximately $373.1 million, which was comprised of $363.8 million outstanding on a term loan due December 15, 2022 and $9.3 million outstanding on a 7.50% Senior Convertible Notes due March 1, 2024.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to service, refinance or repay our debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow\nfunds in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt, meet working capital requirements and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flows, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. The term loan is due December 15, 2022 and the MidCap credit agreement expires on December 31, 2022. Our ability to refinance these agreements is not guaranteed and will depend on the capital and credit markets and our financial condition at such time. Even if we are able to refinance the term loan, we may not be able to obtain favorable terms with a lender. For more information, see \"Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nOur indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences for us and our stockholders. For example, our debt agreements require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes. In addition, our indebtedness could:\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and competitive pressures in our industry;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.\nThe debt agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that will restrict our operational flexibility and require that we maintain specified financial covenants. If we cannot comply with these covenants, we may be in default under either or both debt agreements.\nThe debt agreements governing our indebtedness contain affirmative and negative covenants, including with regard to specified financial covenants, which limit and restrict our operations and may hamper our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Events beyond our control could affect our ability to meet these and other covenants under the debt agreements. Our failure to comply with our covenants and other obligations under the debt agreements may result in an event of default thereunder. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay down the indebtedness (together with accrued interest and fees), or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. This could have serious consequences to our financial condition, operating results and business, and could cause ModusLink or IWCO to become insolvent or enter into bankruptcy proceedings, and shareholders may lose all or a portion of their investment because of the priority of the claims of the creditors on the assets.\nChanges in reference interest rates could adversely affect our results from operations and financial condition.\nAn increase in prevailing interest rates would have an effect on the interest rates charged on our variable rate debt, which rise and fall upon changes in reference interest rates. If prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates, the increased interest expense would adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness.\nIn addition to this, LIBOR, the London Interbank Offered Rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. The Company typically uses LIBOR as a reference rate in the Company's credit facilities such that the interest due to our lenders is calculated using LIBOR. In 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist, if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 or if replacement conventions will be developed. In March 2021, the FCA confirmed that all of the LIBOR settings for Euro and Swiss Franc and some of the LIBOR settings for Japanese Yen, Sterling and US dollars will cease in December 2021 and the remainder of the LIBOR settings for US dollars will cease in June 2023. To identify a successor rate for LIBOR, financial regulators in various countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and Switzerland, have formed working groups with the aim of recommending alternatives to LIBOR denominated in their local currencies. Some of the financial regulators have identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as their preferred alternative rate for LIBOR.\nSOFR is observed and backward-looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question.\nAlthough certain financial regulators have indicated their preference for SOFR as the preferred replacement rate for LIBOR, it is unclear if other benchmarks may emerge or if other rates will be adopted. As such, the future of LIBOR is uncertain.\nAt this time, due to a lack of consensus existing as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the Company's liquidity or interest expense. Uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the performance of LIBOR relative to its historic values. However, even if the financial instruments transition to using alternative benchmarks like SOFR successfully, the new benchmarks are likely to differ from LIBOR, as the alternative benchmark rate may be calculated differently. If LIBOR ceases to exist, the Company may also need to renegotiate its credit agreements that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. This may increase the interest expense associated with our outstanding indebtedness or any future indebtedness we may incur. Further, transitioning to an alternative benchmark rate, such as SOFR, may result in us incurring expense and legal risks, as renegotiation and changes to documentation may be required in effecting the transition. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our borrowing costs, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGENERAL RISKS FACTORS\nAn increase in our effective tax rate may adversely impact our results of operations.\nA number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates, including:\n\u2022the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u2022the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;\n\u2022changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;\n\u2022increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development, impact of costs associated with business combinations and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;\n\u2022changes in available tax credits;\n\u2022changes in share-based compensation;\n\u2022changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles;\n\u2022the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes; and\n\u2022increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions.\nAny significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods.", "PERMNO": 80114, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "STCN"}
