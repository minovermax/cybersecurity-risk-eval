The following discussion addresses some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause, or contribute to causing, actual results to differ materially from expectations. In evaluating our business, you should pay particular attention to the descriptions of risks and uncertainties described below. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future financial performance depends upon increased consumer acceptance, growth of sales of our products, and operational execution of our strategic initiatives. We believe that most consumers are not generally aware of the existence and attributes of moissanite jewels and that the consumer market for moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite remains in the early stages of development. Total moissanite jewelry retail sales have historically been less than 1% of the total jewelry market. The degree of future market acceptance and demand is subject to a significant amount of uncertainty. Our future financial performance will depend, in part, upon greater consumer acceptance of moissanite jewels as an ethically-sourced, affordable, luxurious alternative to other gemstones, such as diamond and our ability to develop brands and execute strategic initiatives, in particular, our direct-to-consumer e-commerce business, to grow our sales and operating income. As we execute our strategy to build and reinvest in our businesses, significant expenses and investment of cash will be required ahead of the revenue streams we expect in the future, and this may adversely affect our operating income. If we are unable to execute and achieve desired revenue levels, we may adjust our strategic initiatives in response to the results of our investments.\nIn addition, consumer acceptance may be affected by retail jewelers\u2019 and jewelry manufacturers\u2019 acceptance of moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite. The quality, design, and workmanship of the jewelry settings, whether manufactured by us or other manufacturers, could affect both consumers\u2019 perception and acceptance of our jewels and costs incurred by returns and markdowns.\nThus, our future financial performance may be affected by:\n\u00b7\nour ability to understand the consumer market segment and effectively market to them a compelling value proposition that leads to converted customers;\n\u00b7\nour ability to reach consumers through traditional and digital channels in order to gain interest in moissanite jewels and jewelry;\n\u00b7\nour continued success in developing and promoting brands for our moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite, resulting in increased interest and demand for moissanite jewelry at the consumer level;\n\u00b7\nthe continued willingness and ability of our jewelry distributors and other jewelry suppliers, manufacturers, and designers to market and promote Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite\u00ae to the retail jewelry trade;\n\u00b7\nthe continued willingness of distributors, retailers, and others in the channel of distribution to purchase loose Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite\u00ae, and the continued willingness of manufacturers, designers, and retail jewelers to undertake setting of the loose jewels;\n\u00b7\nour continued ability and the ability of manufacturers, designers, and retail jewelers to select jewelry settings that encourage consumer acceptance of and demand for our moissanite jewels and finished jewelry;\n\u00b7\nour continued ability and the ability of jewelry manufacturers and retail jewelers to set loose moissanite jewels in finished jewelry with high-quality workmanship;\n\u00b7\nour continued ability and the ability of retail jewelers to effectively market and sell finished jewelry featuring moissanite to consumers; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to operationally execute our direct-to-consumer e-commerce business.\nWe are currently substantially dependent on a limited number of distributors, jewelry manufacturers, and retailers for the sale of our products. The majority of the moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite that we sell are distributed through a limited number of distributors, manufacturers, and retailers and, therefore, we are substantially dependent upon these companies for distribution of our products. During 2016, our three largest customers, two of which are loose jewel and finished jewelry distributors and one of which is a television shopping network which carries loose jewel and finished jewelry, collectively accounted for 45% of net sales. As we continue to build our finished jewelry business, we anticipate in the near term that the majority of the moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite that we sell will continue to be to a limited number of manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.\nThe execution of our business plans could significantly impact our liquidity. The execution of our business plans to expand our direct-to-consumer distribution channels and to create required inventory of our Forever OneTM jewels requires significant investments, which may reduce our cash position. Should we fail to execute on our business plans, we could see delays in the return of cash from our investments, resulting in a liquidity shortfall. Under the $10,000,000 asset-based revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility, that we obtained from Wells Fargo, National Association, or Wells Fargo, on June 25, 2014, failure to conduct our business as conducted on the date we obtained the Credit Facility, failure to make required payments to third parties, or failure to comply with the other covenants and defaults contained in the Credit Facility, including a covenant to maintain at least $1,000,000 in excess availability (as defined under the Credit Facility), could restrict our ability to draw on the Credit Facility. If we are not able to take advances against the Credit Facility, our cash and cash equivalents and other working capital may be insufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs. In addition, the Credit Facility matures on June 25, 2017 and there is no guarantee for extension or renewal.\nOur business and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result of our inability to fulfill orders on a timely basis. As sales of our loose moissanite jewels increase, including our Forever Brilliant\u00ae and Forever OneTM jewels, availability of certain shapes and sizes may be at risk. In addition, finished jewelry has a large variety of styles of which we maintain on-hand stock for such basic designs as stud earrings, solitaire and three-stone rings, pendants, and bracelets; and make-to-order under strict deadlines for certain wholesale and direct-to-consumer e-commerce customers. We must adequately maintain relationships, forecast demand, and operate within the lead times of third parties that facet and/or enhance the jewels and manufacture the finished jewelry setting to ensure adequate on-hand quantities and/or the shipment of customer orders in a timely manner as we transition certain customers from Forever Brilliant\u00ae to Forever OneTM. In addition, we are currently dependent on a limited number of vendors for all of the faceting of our loose jewels. If any or all of these vendors were to cancel their arrangements with us, we could experience a disruption in our operations and incur additional costs to procure faceting services from a replacement vendor. The inability to fulfill orders on a timely basis and within promised customer deadlines could result in a cancellation of the orders and loss of customer goodwill that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe financial difficulties or insolvency of one or more of our major customers or their lack of willingness and ability to market our products could adversely affect results. We are subject to a concentration of credit risk amongst our major customers (some of whom are distributors), and a default by any of these customers on their debts to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Future sales and our ability to collect accounts receivable depend, in part, on the financial strength of our customers and our distributors\u2019 willingness and ability to successfully market our products. We estimate an allowance for accounts for which collectability is at risk and this allowance adversely impacts profitability. In the event customers experience greater than anticipated financial difficulties, insolvency, or difficulty marketing products, we expect profitability to be adversely impacted by our failure to collect accounts receivable in excess of the estimated allowance. In these circumstances, we may demand the return of product sold to such customers, resulting in an increase in inventory and a reduction in accounts receivable. Given the current economic environment, constrained access to capital and general market contractions may heighten our exposure to customer default and lower than expected distributor sales.\nWe expect to remain dependent upon the Supply Agreement with Cree for the sole supply of our SiC crystals for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to obtain sufficient, high-quality SiC crystals from Cree and we have a significant increase in demand for our moissanite jewels, then we may not be able to meet that demand. Cree has certain proprietary rights relating to its process for growing large single crystals of SiC and its process for growing near-colorless SiC crystals. Under the Supply Agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions, we agreed to exclusively purchase from Cree, and Cree agreed to exclusively supply, 100% of our required SiC materials in quarterly installments that must equal or exceed a set minimum order quantity. The initial term of the Supply Agreement will expire on June 24, 2018, unless extended by the parties. We also have one option to unilaterally extend the term of the agreement for an additional two-year period, subject to certain conditions. Our total purchase commitment under the Supply Agreement until June 2018 is dependent upon the size of the SiC material and ranges between approximately $29.6 million and approximately $31.5 million. However, there can be no assurance that Cree will be able to continue to produce and supply us with SiC crystals of sufficient quality, sizes, and volumes that we desire or that we will successfully negotiate future purchase commitments at acceptable prices that enable us to manage our inventories and raw material costs effectively.\nWe face intense competition in the worldwide jewelry industry. The jewelry industry is highly competitive and we compete with numerous other jewelry products. In addition, we face competition from treated diamonds, synthetic diamonds, lab-grown diamonds, other moissanite jewels, and companies developing other synthetic jewelry technologies. A substantial number of companies supply products to the jewelry industry, many of which we believe have greater financial resources than we do. Competitors could develop new or improved technologies that may render the price point for moissanite noncompetitive, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, we have relied on our patent rights and other intellectual property rights to maintain our competitive position. Our current U.S. product and method patents for moissanite jewels expired in 2015 and most of our patents in foreign jurisdictions expired in 2016 with only Mexico remaining (which expires in 2021). As a result, we anticipate new providers of moissanite will enter the market. However, because the process of creating high-quality moissanite is challenging, we believe it will take emerging providers significant time and investment to bring meaningful and competitive products to market. As we experienced ourselves, we anticipate it will take these new providers significant time to evolve from producing low-end moissanite to delivering high-quality gemstones in the colorless or near-colorless range. Achieving the capacity to consistently produce a high-quality moissanite product at mass scale requires a careful balance of silicon carbide-specific faceting skills and a well-tuned global supply chain. Therefore, we do not anticipate direct moissanite competition in the colorless grade D-E-F or near-colorless grade G-H-I ranges for some time to come. If, however, we are unable to successfully build strong brands for our moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite or competition grows faster than expected, we may not have commercially meaningful protection for our products or a commercial advantage against our competitors or their competitive products or processes, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe resignation of our Chief Financial Officer and the departure of our Chief Revenue Officer create uncertainties and could impact our business. Effective December 2, 2016, Kyle S. Macemore resigned as our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Clint J. Pete, our current Corporate Controller, was appointed to serve as our Interim Chief Financial Officer effective upon Mr. Macemore\u2019s resignation. In addition, effective January 10, 2017, Steve Larkin, our Chief Revenue Officer, is no longer with the Company. The Company\u2019s ability to execute its business strategies may be adversely affected by the uncertainty associated with these transitions.\nLeadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty and decreased productivity among our employees and increase the likelihood of turnover, which could result in significant disruptions to our operations. We could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team should we have additional departures. In addition, these management transitions inherently cause some loss of institutional knowledge, which can negatively affect strategy and execution, and our results of operations and financial condition could suffer as a result. Finally, we continue to execute a number of significant business initiatives. Successfully managing these initiatives, including retention of key employees, is critical to our business success.\nSales of our common stock by Mr. Larkin may cause the market price of our common stock to decrease. As previously noted, Steve Larkin, our Chief Revenue Officer, is no longer with our company, effective as of January 10, 2017. Upon Mr. Larkin\u2019s departure, he held 279,957 shares of common stock and options exercisable for 150,000 shares of common stock. Mr. Larkin has the ability, subject to applicable securities laws, to sell all or a portion of his currently held common stock and any shares of common stock he obtains through the exercise of in- the-money stock options to provide liquidity or to diversify his investments. If he does sell his common stock into the market, these sales may cause the market price of our common stock to decrease.\nOur failure to maintain compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements could result in the delisting of our common stock. Our common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. In order to maintain this listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements. In the past, we have received a notification letter from NASDAQ indicating that we were not in compliance with listing requirements because the minimum bid price of our common stock closed below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. However, NASDAQ subsequently notified us that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. If we fail to satisfy NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements in the future, we expect to take actions to regain compliance, but we can provide no assurance that any such action would prevent our common stock from dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements. If our common stock is delisted from NASDAQ, the delisting could substantially decrease trading in our common stock and adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock; adversely affect our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, if at all; and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers, and employees and fewer business development opportunities. Additionally, the market price of our common stock may decline further and shareholders may lose some or all of their investment.\nOur current wholesale customers may potentially perceive us as a competitor in the finished jewelry business. As described above, we are currently substantially dependent on a limited number of customers, including distributors and jewelry manufacturers, for the sale of our products. Our design, manufacture, and marketing of finished jewelry featuring moissanite under exclusive brands for sale to distributors and retailers may result in some of these current customers perceiving us as a competitor, despite our efforts to use primarily non-conflicting sales channels. In response, these customers may choose to reduce their orders for our products. This reduction in orders could occur faster than our sales growth in this business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may experience quality control challenges from time to time that can result in lost revenue and harm to our brands and reputation. Part of our strategy for success is to establish Charles & Colvard with reputable, high-quality, and sophisticated brands. The achievement of this goal depends in large part on our ability to provide customers with high-quality moissanite and finished jewelry featuring moissanite. Although we take measures to ensure that we sell only the best quality products, we may face quality control challenges, which could impact our competitive advantage. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and resolve all quality control issues prior to shipment of products to our distributors, manufacturers, retailers, and end consumers. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, lost customers, significant warranty and other expenses, and harm to our reputation.\nOur business and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result of general economic and market conditions. Our business, including our sales volumes and overall profitability, could be adversely impacted by disruptions in global financial markets, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increased unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the effects of these disruptions in the financial markets and the adverse global economic conditions, and if economic conditions deteriorate, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The consequences of such adverse effects could include interruptions or delays in our suppliers\u2019 performance of our contracts, reductions and delays in customer purchases, delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products, and bankruptcy of customers and/or suppliers.\nLuxury products, such as fine jewelry, are discretionary purchases for consumers. Recessionary economic cycles, higher interest rates, higher fuel and energy costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets, access to credit, consumer debt levels, unsettled financial markets, and other economic factors that may affect consumer spending or buying habits could materially and adversely affect demand for our products. In addition, volatility in the financial markets has had and may continue to have a negative impact on consumer spending patterns. A reduction in consumer spending or disposable income may affect us more significantly than companies in other industries and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to certain risks due to our international distribution channels and vendors. We currently have over 20 international distributors for moissanite jewels covering portions of Western Europe, Australia, India, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. In addition, we use certain companies based outside the U.S. to facet our moissanite jewels and to manufacture finished jewelry. Due to our reliance on development of foreign markets and use of foreign vendors, we are subject to the risks of conducting business outside of the U.S. These risks include the following:\n\u00b7\nthe adverse effects on U.S.-based companies operating in foreign markets that might result from war; terrorism; changes in diplomatic, trade, or business relationships; or other political, social, religious, or economic instability;\n\u00b7\nthe continuing adverse economic effects of any global financial crisis;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\ndelays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses;\n\u00b7\ntariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions;\n\u00b7\nthe burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and other factors beyond our control;\n\u00b7\nthe potential difficulty of enforcing agreements with foreign customers and suppliers; and\n\u00b7\nthe complications related to collecting receivables through a foreign country\u2019s legal system.\nAdditionally, while all of our foreign transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, foreign currency fluctuations could impact demand for our products or the ability of our foreign suppliers to continue to perform. Further, some of our foreign distributors operate relatively small businesses and may not have the financial stability to assure their continuing presence in their markets. There can be no assurance that the foregoing factors will not adversely affect our operations in the future or require us to modify our anticipated business practices.\nOur operations could be disrupted by natural disasters. We conduct substantially all of our activities, including executive management, manufacturing, packaging, and distribution activities, at one North Carolina location. Although we have taken precautions to safeguard our facility, including obtaining business interruption insurance, any future natural disaster, such as a hurricane, flood or fire, could significantly disrupt our operations and delay or prevent product shipment during the time required to repair, rebuild or replace our facility, which could be lengthy and result in significant expenses. Furthermore, the insurance coverage we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case or continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms. In addition, the vendors that perform all of the faceting of our loose moissanite jewels are located in regions that are susceptible to tsunamis, flooding, and other natural disasters that may cause a disruption in our vendors\u2019 operations for sustained periods and the loss or damage of our work-in-process inventories located at such vendors\u2019 facilities. Damage or destruction that interrupts our ability to deliver our products could impair our relationships with our customers. Prolonged disruption of our services as a result of a natural disaster may result in product delivery delays, order cancellations, and loss of substantial revenue, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nSales of moissanite jewelry could be dependent upon the pricing of precious metals, which is beyond our control. Any increases in the market price of precious metals (primarily gold) could affect the pricing and sales of jewelry incorporating moissanite jewels, including jewelry manufactured by us. The majority of price increases in precious metals are passed on to the end consumer in the form of higher prices for finished jewelry. These higher prices could have a negative impact on the sell-through of moissanite jewelry at the retail level. From the beginning of 2006 through 2016, the price of gold has increased significantly (approximately 117%), resulting in higher retail price points for gold jewelry. This has had a negative impact on both sales of moissanite jewelry and the jewelry industry as a whole.\nSeasonality of our business may adversely affect our net sales and operating income. Sales in the retail jewelry industry are typically seasonal due to increased consumer purchases during the holiday season. Because historically we have primarily sold our loose jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite at wholesale to distributors, manufacturers, and retailers, our sales to support the holiday season largely have taken place during the third and beginning of the fourth calendar quarters, depending on the sales channel and the level of advance planning and production our customers undertook. As sales of our finished jewelry featuring moissanite to retailers and directly to consumers increase, both in dollars and as a percentage of total sales, our fourth quarter results may depend upon the general level of retail sales during the holiday season as well as general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. In anticipation of increased sales activities during the fourth quarter, we may incur significant additional expenses, including higher inventory of finished jewelry in the second half of the year. In recent years, excluding one-time sales events, we have experienced a higher degree of seasonality in the fourth quarter than we have experienced in prior years primarily as a result of the holiday season sales to end consumers through our direct-to-consumer e-commerce website, charlesandcolvard.com and as a result of increased sales through televised home shopping networks within our wholesale distribution segment. Our quarterly results of operations may continue to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including seasonal cycles, the timing of new product introductions, the timing of orders by our customers, and the mix of product sales demand, and these factors may significantly affect our results of operations in a given quarter.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our products and brands and adversely affect our business. We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. We had U.S. product and method patents for moissanite jewels, which expired in August 2015, under which we believed that we had broad, exclusive rights to manufacture, use, and sell moissanite jewels in the U.S. We had these same patents in 25 foreign jurisdictions primarily across Asia and Europe that expired in the third quarter of 2016, and will expire in Mexico in 2021. However, our patent expirations could enable competitors and other businesses to duplicate and market a similar product and enter the marketplace. Without patent protection, we must rely primarily on our branding strategy and the Supply Agreement under which Cree supplies SiC crystals exclusively to us, as well as confidentiality procedures, to protect our proprietary rights, which may or may not be sufficient. In addition, at the present time, we are dependent on Cree\u2019s technology for the production of SiC crystals. There can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by or to us will provide any significant commercial protection, that we will have sufficient resources to protect our respective patents and proprietary rights, that any additional patents will be issued in the future, or that any existing or future patents will be upheld by a court should we seek to enforce our rights against an infringer. At this point, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact these patent expirations will have on our future results of operations.\nThe existence of valid patents does not prevent other companies from independently developing competing technologies. Existing producers of SiC crystals or others may refine existing processes for growing SiC crystals or develop new technologies for growing large single crystals of SiC or colorless SiC crystals in a manner that does not infringe any patents issued to or licensed by or to us. Accordingly, existing and potential competitors may be able to develop products that are competitive with or superior to our products, and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, we have certain trademarks and pending trademark applications that support our moissanite branding strategy, and we use certain brand names for which we do not currently have proprietary rights. The success of our growth strategy may depend on our continued ability to use our existing brand names in order to increase consumer awareness and further develop strong brands around our moissanite jewels and finished jewelry collections. We cannot assure that any future trademark or other registrations will be issued for pending or future applications or that we will be able to obtain licenses or other contractual rights to use brand names that may infringe the proprietary rights of third parties. We also cannot assure that any registered or unregistered trademarks or other intellectual property or contractual rights will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights. Our inability to secure proprietary protection with respect to our brands could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe also cannot be certain that our products and brand names do not or will not infringe valid patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights held by third parties. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to the intellectual property of others in the ordinary course of our business. Litigation to determine the validity of any third party\u2019s claims could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is determined in our favor. In the event of an adverse result of any such litigation, we could be required to expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or to obtain licenses for, and pay royalties on the use of, the technology subject to the litigation. We have no assurance that we would be successful in such development or that any such license would be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA failure of our information technology (IT) infrastructure or a failure to protect confidential information of our customers and our network against security breaches could adversely impact our business and operations. We rely upon the capacity, reliability, and security of our information technology infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. For example, we implemented new IT systems and payment gateways that support our wholesale and charlesandcolvard.com e-commerce businesses. As we implement and integrate new systems, or de-integrate systems, they may not perform as expected. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or a security breach of our IT systems, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, we and certain of our third-party vendors receive and store personal information associated with our sales operations and other aspects of our business. In connection with our e-commerce business, we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to effect secure transmission of confidential information, including credit card numbers. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems and e-commerce business are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack, and other similar disruptions. An increasing number of websites and Internet companies have reported breaches of their security. Any such compromise of our security could damage our reputation, business, and brand and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, which could substantially harm our business and results of operations. In addition, anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations, damage our computers or those of our customers, or otherwise damage our reputation and business. These issues are likely to become more difficult as we expand the number of countries in which our e-commerce website operates. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches.\nIf the e-commerce opportunity changes dramatically or if e-commerce technology or providers change their models, our results of operations may be adversely affected. As we adopt e-commerce as one of our primary selling channels, our business model becomes more reliant on third-party platforms to achieve success. Should our products, product listings, or business not meet the requirements of certain third-party transactional channels such as marketplaces, comparison shopping engines, or social commerce sites, it may affect our ability to meet our revenue targets. Additionally, Amazon, eBay, Jet, Walmart.com, Gemvara, or other desirable e-commerce platforms may decide to make significant changes to their respective business models, policies, systems, or plans, and those changes could impair or inhibit our ability to sell our products through those channels. Further, a significant change in consumer online behavior or introduction of new or disruptive technology could adversely affect overall e-commerce trends and diminish the value of investments we have made in select online channels. Any of these results could cause a significant reduction in our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we fail to evaluate, implement, and integrate strategic acquisition or disposition opportunities successfully, our business may suffer. From time to time we evaluate strategic opportunities available to us for product, technology, or business acquisitions or dispositions. If we choose to make acquisitions or dispositions, we face certain risks, such as failure of an acquired business to meet our performance expectations, failure to recognize cost savings from a disposition, diversion of management attention, retention of management and existing customers of our current and any acquired business, and difficulty in integrating or separating a business\u2019s operations, personnel, and financial and operating systems. We may not be able to successfully address these risks or any other problems that arise from future acquisitions or dispositions. Any failure to successfully evaluate strategic opportunities and address risks or other problems that arise related to any acquisition or disposition could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nGovernmental regulation and oversight might adversely impact our operations. We are subject to governmental regulations in the manufacture and sale of moissanite jewels and finished jewelry. In particular, the FTC has issued regulations and guidelines governing the marketing of synthetic gemstones and other gemstones similar to diamond that require such gemstones to be clearly identified in any promotional or marketing materials. In addition, the precious metal in our finished jewelry may be subject to requirements, which vary by country and by state, such as hallmarking and alloy content. We may be under close scrutiny both by governmental agencies and by competitors in the gemstone industry, any of which may challenge our promotion and marketing of our moissanite jewels and finished jewelry products. While we have a policy to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, if our production or marketing of moissanite jewels and/or finished jewelry is challenged by governmental agencies or competitors, or if regulations are issued that restrict our ability to market our products, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nSome anti-takeover provisions of our charter documents may delay or prevent a takeover of our company. A number of provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws impact matters of corporate governance and the rights of shareholders. Certain of these provisions have an anti-takeover effect and may delay or prevent takeover attempts not first approved by our Board of Directors (including takeovers that certain shareholders may deem to be in their best interests). These provisions also could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors or the assumption of control by shareholders. We believe that these provisions are appropriate to protect our interests and the interests of all of our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 85539, "SIC": 3290, "TIC": "CTHR"}
