{"cik": "71829", "company": "NEWPARK RESOURCES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following summarizes the most significant risk factors to our business. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks. Any of these risk factors, either individually or in combination, could have significant adverse impacts to our results of operations and financial condition, or prevent us from meeting our profitability or growth objectives.\nRisks Related to our Customer Concentration and Cyclical Nature of the E&P Industry\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from companies in the E&P industry, and our customer base is concentrated in major integrated and independent oil and gas E&P companies operating in the markets that we serve. In 2014, approximately 40% of our consolidated revenues were derived from our 20 largest customers, although no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues.\nThe E&P industry is historically cyclical, with levels of activity generally affected by the following factors:\n\u25a0 current oil and natural gas prices and expectations about future prices\n\u25a0 the cost to explore for, produce and deliver oil and gas\n\u25a0 the discovery rate for new oil and gas reserves\n\u25a0 the ability of oil and gas companies to raise capital\n\u25a0 domestic and international political, military, regulatory and economic conditions\n\u25a0 government regulations regarding environmental protection, taxation, price controls and product allocation\nAny of the factors above could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Specifically, during the fourth quarter of 2014 and early 2015, the price for oil has declined dramatically from the price levels in recent years and there are no assurances that the price for oil will not continue to decline. Following this decline, U.S. drilling activity has decreased, which will reduce the demand for our services and negatively impact customer pricing in our North American operations in 2015. Due to these expected changes, our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in future periods. Because our business has high fixed costs, including significant facility and personnel expenses, downtime or low productivity due to reduced demand can have a significant adverse impact on our profitability.\nRisks Related to Operating Hazards Present in the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\nOur operations are subject to hazards present in the oil and natural gas industry, such as fire, explosion, blowouts, oil spills and leaks or spills of hazardous materials (both onshore and offshore). These incidents as well as accidents or problems in normal operations can cause personal injury or death and damage to property or the environment. The customer\u2019s operations can also be interrupted and it is possible that such incidents can interrupt our ongoing operations and the ability to provide our services. From time to time, customers seek recovery for damage to their equipment or property that occurred during the course of our service obligations. Damage to the customer\u2019s property and any related spills of hazardous materials could be extensive if a major problem occurred. We purchase insurance which may provide coverage for incidents such as those described above, however, the policies may not provide coverage or a sufficient amount of coverage for all types of damage claims that could be asserted against us. See the section entitled \u201cRisks Related to the Inherent Limitations of Insurance Coverage\u201d for additional information.\nRisks Related to International Operations\nWe have significant operations outside of the United States, including certain areas of Canada, EMEA, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. In 2014, these international operations generated approximately 33% of our consolidated revenues. In addition, we may seek to expand to other areas outside the United States in the future. International operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25a0 difficulties and cost associated with complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws, treaties and regulations\n\u25a0 uncertainties in or unexpected changes in regulatory environments or tax laws\n\u25a0 legal uncertainties, timing delays and expenses associated with tariffs, export licenses and other trade barriers\n\u25a0 difficulties enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems\n\u25a0 risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export laws, and other similar U.S. laws applicable to our operations in international markets\n\u25a0 exchange controls or other limitations on international currency movements\n\u25a0 sanctions imposed by the U.S. government that prevent us from engaging in business in certain countries\n\u25a0 inability to obtain or preserve certain intellectual property rights in the foreign countries in which we operate\n\u25a0 our inexperience in new international markets\n\u25a0 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates\n\u25a0 political and economic instability\n\u25a0 acts of terrorism\nIn addition, several North African markets in which we operate, including Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Algeria experienced social and political unrest in recent years, which negatively impacted our operating results, including the temporary suspension of our operations. More recently in Brazil, a significant number of senior executives at Petrobras resigned their positions in connection with a widely-publicized corruption investigation. We expect these developments to further disrupt Petrobras\u2019 operations in the near term.\nRisks Related to the Cost and Continued Availability of Borrowed Funds\nWe employ borrowed funds as an integral part of our long-term capital structure and our future success is dependent upon continued access to borrowed funds to support our operations. The availability of borrowed funds on reasonable terms is dependent on the condition of credit markets and financial institutions from which these funds are obtained. Adverse events in the financial markets may significantly reduce the availability of funds, which may have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowings and our ability to fund our business strategy. In addition, changes in commodity prices, such as the recent declines in the price of oil, may have an adverse effect on the availability of borrowed funds or the cost of borrowings to us and our customers. As many of our customers finance their drilling and production operations through borrowed funds, the reduced availability and increased cost of borrowing could cause our customers to reduce their spending on drilling programs, thereby reducing demand and potentially pricing for our products and services.\nOur ability to meet our debt service requirements and the continued availability of funds under our existing or future credit agreements is dependent upon our ability to continue generating operating income and remain in compliance with the covenants in our credit agreements. This, in turn, is subject to the volatile nature of the E&P industry, and to competitive, economic, financial and other factors that are beyond our control.\nRisks Related to Business Acquisitions and Capital Investments\nOur ability to successfully execute our business strategy will depend, among other things, on our ability to make capital investments and acquisitions which provide us with financial benefits. In 2015, our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $70 million to $90 million, including additional investments to complete our mat manufacturing expansion project and research and development facilities, the expansion of our chemical blending capabilities and field service infrastructure, additions to our composite mat rental fleet, as well as expansion of our field equipment. These investments are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25a0 incorrect assumptions regarding the future benefits or results from our capital investments, acquired operations or assets\n\u25a0 failure to complete a planned acquisition transaction or to successfully integrate the operations or management of any acquired businesses or assets in a timely manner\n\u25a0 diversion of management's attention from existing operations or other priorities\n\u25a0 unanticipated disruptions to our business associated with the implementation of our enterprise-wide operational and financial system\n\u25a0 delays in completion and cost overruns associated with large construction projects, including those mentioned above\nAny of the factors above could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Availability of Raw Materials and Skilled Personnel\nOur ability to provide products and services to our customers is dependent upon our ability to obtain the raw materials and qualified personnel necessary to operate our business.\nBarite is a naturally occurring mineral that constitutes a significant portion of our drilling fluids systems. We currently secure the majority of our barite ore from foreign sources, primarily China and India. The availability and cost of barite ore is dependent on factors beyond our control including transportation, political priorities and government imposed export fees in the exporting countries, as well as the impact of weather and natural disasters. The future supply of barite ore from existing sources could be inadequate to meet the market demand, particularly during periods of increasing world-wide demand, which could ultimately result in a reduction in industry activity, or our inability to meet customer\u2019s needs.\nOur mats business is highly dependent on the availability of high-density polyethylene (\u201cHDPE\u201d), which is the primary raw material used in the manufacture of the DURA-BASE mat. The cost of HDPE can vary significantly based on the energy costs of the producers of HDPE, demand for this material, and the capacity/operations of the plants used to make HDPE. Should our cost of HDPE increase, we may not be able to increase our customer pricing to cover our costs, which may result in a reduction in future profitability.\nAll of our businesses are also highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled engineers, technical sales and service personnel. The market for these employees is very competitive, and if we cannot attract and retain quality personnel, our ability to compete effectively and to grow our business will be severely limited. Also, a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force or an increase in our operating costs.\nRisks Related to the Impact of Restrictions on Offshore Drilling Activity\nFollowing the Deepwater Horizon event in 2010, the Department of Interior of the U.S. government took several actions aimed at restricting and temporarily prohibiting certain drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Following the adoption of a number of new regulations impacting offshore drilling activities by a variety of regulatory authorities, drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico has recovered. However, additional or renewed restrictions on exploration and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico and other offshore basins in the United States and globally in response to a similar event or perceptions of the risks of a similar event could have a significant impact on our business.\nRisk Related to our Market Competition\nWe face competition in the Fluids Systems business from larger companies, which compete vigorously on fluids performance and/or price. In addition, these companies have broad product and service offerings in addition to their drilling fluids. At times, these larger companies attempt to compete by offering discounts to customers to use multiple products and services from our competitor, some of which we do not offer. We also have smaller regional competitors competing with us mainly on price and local relationships. Our competition in the Mats and Integrated Services business is fragmented, with many competitors providing various forms of mat products and services. More recently several competitors have begun marketing composite products to compete with our DURA-BASE mat system. While we believe the design and manufacture of our mat products provide a differentiated value to our customers, many of our competitors seek to compete on pricing.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters, Including Environmental Regulations\nWe are responsible for complying with numerous federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies that govern environmental protection, zoning and other matters applicable to our current and past business activities, including the activities of our former subsidiaries. Failure to remain compliant with these laws and regulations may result in fines, penalties, costs of cleanup of contaminated sites and site closure obligations, or other expenditures. Further, any changes in the current legal and regulatory environment could impact industry activity and the demands for our products and services, the scope of products and services that we provide, or our cost structure required to provide our products and services, or the costs incurred by our customers.\nThe markets for our products and services are dependent on the continued exploration for and production of fossil fuels (predominantly oil and natural gas). Climate change is receiving increased attention worldwide. Many scientists, legislators and others attribute climate change to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) has adopted regulations that potentially limit greenhouse gas emissions and impose reporting obligations on large greenhouse gas emission sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules that could require the reduction of certain air emissions during exploration and production of oil and gas. To the extent that laws and regulations enacted as part of climate change legislation increase the costs of drilling for or producing such fossil fuels, or reduce the demand for fossil fuels, such legislation could have a material adverse impact on our operations and profitability.\nHydraulic fracturing is an increasingly common practice used by E&P operators to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly from shale oil and gas formations in the United States. The process of hydraulic fracturing, which involves the injection of sand (or other forms of proppants) laden fluids into oil and gas bearing zones, has come under increasing scrutiny from a variety of regulatory agencies, including the EPA and various state authorities. Several states have adopted regulations requiring operators to identify the chemicals used in fracturing operations, others have adopted moratoriums on the use of fracturing, and the State of New York has banned the practice altogether. The EPA has commenced a study of the potential impact of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water including the disposal of waste fluid by underground injection. Further, the EPA has announced plans to develop effluent limitations associated with wastewater generated by hydraulic fracturing. Although we do not provide hydraulic fracturing services and our drilling fluids products are not used in such services, regulations which have the effect of limiting the use or availability of hydraulic fracturing could have a significant negative impact on the drilling activity levels of our customers, and, therefore, the demand for our products and services.\nRisks Related to the Inherent Limitations of Insurance Coverage\nWhile we maintain liability insurance, this insurance is subject to coverage limitations. Specific risks and limitations of our insurance coverage include the following:\n\u25a0 self-insured retention limits on each claim, which are our responsibility\n\u25a0 exclusions for certain types of liabilities and limitations on coverage for damages resulting from pollution\n\u25a0 coverage limits of the policies, and the risk that claims will exceed policy limits\n\u25a0 the financial strength and ability of our insurance carriers to meet their obligations under the policies\nIn addition, our ability to continue to obtain insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms is dependent upon a variety of factors impacting the insurance industry in general, which are outside our control.\nAny of the issues noted above, including insurance cost increases, uninsured or underinsured claims, or the inability of an insurance carrier to meet their financial obligations could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nRisks Related to Potential Impairments of Long-lived Intangible Assets\nAs of December 31, 2014, our consolidated balance sheet includes $91.9 million in goodwill and $15.7 million of intangible assets, net. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently as the circumstances require, using a combination of market multiple and discounted cash flow approaches. In completing this annual evaluation during the fourth quarter of 2014, we determined that no reporting unit had a fair value below its net carrying value, and therefore, no impairment was required. As a result of the significant declines in oil prices and decreases in U.S. drilling activities subsequent to our November 1, 2014 evaluation date, we updated our fair value estimates based on our current forecasts and market conditions and determined that each reporting unit\u2019s fair value remains in excess of its net carrying value. However, if the financial performance or future projections for our operating segments deteriorate significantly from current levels, a future impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may be required, which would negatively impact our financial results, in the period of impairment.\nRisks Related to Technological Developments in our Industry\nThe market for our products and services is characterized by continual technological developments that generate substantial improvements in product functions and performance. If we are not successful in continuing to develop product enhancements or new products that are accepted in the marketplace or that comply with industry standards, we could lose market share to competitors, which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe hold U.S. and foreign patents for certain of our drilling fluids components and our mat systems. However, these patents are not a guarantee that we will have a meaningful advantage over our competitors, and there is a risk that others may develop systems that are substantially equivalent to those covered by our patents. If that were to happen, we would face increased competition from both a service and a pricing standpoint. In addition, costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our patents and proprietary rights. It is possible that future innovation could change the way companies drill for oil and gas which could reduce the competitive advantages we may derive from our patents and other proprietary technology.\nRisks Related to Severe Weather, Particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast\nApproximately 19% of our consolidated revenue from continuing operations in 2014 was generated in market areas in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and related near-shore areas, which are susceptible to hurricanes and other adverse weather events. These weather events can disrupt our operations and result in damage to our properties, as well as negatively impact the activity and financial condition of our customers. Our business may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of future hurricanes or other adverse weather events in regions in which we operate.\nRisks Related to Fluctuations in the Market Value of our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate due to a number of factors, including the general economy, stock market conditions, general trends in the E&P industry, announcements made by us or our competitors, and variations in our operating results. Investors may not be able to predict the timing or extent of these fluctuations.", "PERMNO": 34673, "SIC": 5160, "TIC": "NR"}
