{"cik": "1314772", "company": "Summer Infant, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline. The risk factors listed below are not exhaustive. We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment in which new factors may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict the impact of all of these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business may be materially adversely impacted due to the recent coronavirus outbreak in the U.S.\nOur business may be materially adversely impacted by the effects of the recent coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. In addition to other risks related to the outbreak noted below, such as to our supply chain or a temporary closure of our distribution facility, as of the date of this filing, multiple retail stores in the U.S. have temporarily closed their stores in response to the outbreak, and state governments are taking action to curtail public activities. A significant portion of our sales in 2019 were made to large and small retail stores. We cannot at this time accurately predict what effects the closure of our customers' stores and the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. will have on our sales in 2020, including due to uncertainties relating to the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, the length of voluntary business closures and governmental actions taken in response to the outbreak. More generally, a widespread health crisis could adversely affect the U.S. economy, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and therefore impact our results.\nThe concentration of our business with certain retail customers means that changes in the purchasing policies of these customers could have a significant impact on our business and operating results.\nIn fiscal 2019, sales to our top seven customers, including Amazon.com, Wal-Mart, and Target, accounted for approximately 81% of our total sales. We do not have long-term commitments or contracts with any of our retail customers, and retailers make purchases by delivering one-time purchase orders. As such, any customer could potentially renegotiate the terms of our business relationship at any time, which might include reducing overall purchases of our products, altering pricing, reducing the number and variety of our products carried and the shelf space allotted for our products, and reducing cooperative advertising or marketing support. Because of the current concentration of our business with these retail customers, a change in our relationship with any of these customers could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreased tariffs, additional tariffs or other import or export taxes on our products could have an adverse impact on the cost of our product, the demand for our products and our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, any suspension, revocation, expiration, non-renewal or other loss of our temporary exemption from certain tariffs could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe United States and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods, including products imported into the United States from China. The majority of our products are manufactured outside the United States, mainly in China, and imported for sale in the United States. Tariffs enacted in 2018 and 2019 impacted our 2018 and 2019 results, and caused market disruption amongst our major customers. While we took actions to mitigate the impact of these tariffs and are exploring alternative sources of supply outside of China, if existing tariffs are increased or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by the United States, China or other countries, the cost of our products\nmanufactured in China or other countries and imported into the United States would increase substantially, which would force us to increase the prices of the affected products.\nIn December 2019, an exclusion for metal safety gates was granted by the USTR, retroactive to the date of implementation (September 2018). Any amounts we paid in respect of such tariffs between the time of their implementation and the date the exclusion was granted will be refunded. However, the exclusion is temporary and expires in August 2020. While the USTR is expected to publish a process to seek extension of the exclusion, there can be no guarantee that the exclusion will be extended past August 2020. Any suspension, revocation, expiration, non-renewal or other loss of the granted exclusion could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We would be required to negotiate for increased prices to mitigate the impact of the tariffs, which in turn could impact demand for our products.\nThere is no assurance that we would be successful in mitigating the impact of increased or additional tariffs, and any increase in pricing to allow us to maintain reasonable margins could adversely affect the demand for those products and may result in decreased profitability and lower sales, thereby having an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of or savings from our restructuring initiatives, and our restructuring initiatives may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2020, we announced restructuring initiatives to further streamline our operations and improve our financial outlook. We may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that are initially anticipated in connection with these restructuring initiatives. Reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. If these initiatives are not implemented in a timely manner, anticipated cost savings and benefits are not realized, business disruption occurs during the pendency of or following such actions, or unanticipated charges are incurred, particularly if material, there may be a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe intense competition in our market could reduce our net sales and profitability.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and compete with several large domestic and foreign companies and with smaller producers of infant and juvenile products. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than us, or have greater e-commerce and social media presence than us. We experience price competition for our products and competition for shelf space at retailers, all of which may increase in the future. If we cannot adjust to changes in our market and compete successfully in the future, our net sales and profitability will likely decline.\nOur ability to grow and compete will be harmed if we do not successfully satisfy consumer preferences, enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products, and successfully market and achieve acceptance of our products.\nOur business and operating results depend largely upon providing our customers with products that appeal to the end user. Consumer preferences are constantly changing, particularly among parents whom are often the end purchasers of our products. Our success largely depends on our ability to identify emerging trends in the infant and juvenile health, safety and wellness marketplace, and to design quality products that address consumer preferences and prove safe and cost effective.\nOur ability to maintain and increase our current market share will depend upon our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and satisfy these preferences, enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products, grow existing distribution channels and seek additional distribution channels for these products, successfully market the products and, ultimately, achieve\nconsumer acceptance of these products. A failure to achieve market acceptance of our products could harm our ability to grow our business.\nAn inability to develop and introduce planned new products or product lines in a timely and cost-effective manner may damage our business.\nIn developing new products and product lines, we have anticipated dates for associated product introductions. When we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a particular product or product line at a certain time in the future, those expectations are based on completing the associated development, implementation, marketing work, and manufacturing in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule. Unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development, changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products, and delays in the manufacturing process may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or, in some situations, may cause a product introduction to be discontinued. The risk is also heightened by the sophistication of certain products we are designing, in terms of combining digital and analog technologies, and providing greater innovation and product differentiation. If we are unable to manufacture, source and ship new products in a timely manner and on a cost effective basis, it could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIf we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels or if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities, or on a timely basis, or if our inventory levels are too high, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur business places stringent demands on our inventory forecasting and production planning processes. This inventory management approach may be particularly challenging when combined with \"just-in-time\" inventory management systems commonly used by customers to minimize their inventory levels. If we fail to meet tight shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with customers, increase our shipping costs or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. To deliver our merchandise on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. This approach requires us to begin to place orders for components for certain products up to a year in advance, and we procure a significant amount of product months in advance of certain time periods. At the time we place factory orders, we may not have firm orders from customers or a complete understanding of what consumer demand for those products will be. If our inventory forecasting processes are not accurate, it may result in inventory levels in excess of the levels forecasted and we may not have sufficient space at our main distribution center to accommodate excess inventory. As a result, we could be required to record inventory write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory, and/or incur additional expense for storage of excess inventory, which would adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if our processes result in our inventory levels being too low to meet customer demand, we may lose sales, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nCovenants in our credit facility and term loan agreement may affect our liquidity or limit our ability to complete acquisitions, incur debt, make investments, sell assets, merge or complete other significant transactions. Deviations from expected results of operations and expected cash requirements could result in a failure to meet financial covenants, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on our credit facility and cash generated from our operations to meet our working capital needs. Our credit facility and term loan agreement include certain covenants that place limitations on or restrict a number of our activities, including our ability to incur additional debt, create liens on our assets or make guarantees, make certain investments or loans, pay dividends or make distributions, dispose of or sell assets, or enter into a merger or similar transaction.\nThese restrictive covenants may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best long-term interests. In addition, if we do not maintain a specified level of availability under our credit facility and term loan agreement, we will be required to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant. Any significant deviation in actual results from our expected results of operations, or in the timing of material expenditures from current estimates, any significant business or product acquisitions, or other significant unanticipated expenses could result in us not meeting applicable financial covenants.\nNon-compliance with the covenants in our credit facility and term loan agreement could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our credit facility, a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations. If access to our credit facility is limited or terminated, our liquidity would be constrained, affecting our operations and growth prospects, and we would need to seek amendments to our credit facility or obtain additional equity or debt financing or face default. There is no assurance that such financing would be available on acceptable terms or at all. Furthermore, any equity financing may result in dilution to existing stockholders and any debt financing may include restrictive covenants that could impede our ability to effectively operate and grow our business in the future.\nLiquidity problems or bankruptcy of our key retail customers could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is with key retail customers. Due to the current pressure on traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, there is increased risk that retailers may suffer material losses or file for a petition for bankruptcy. Sales to retail customers are typically made on credit without collateral. If a customer files for bankruptcy, our pre-petition accounts receivable may not be realized and post-petition orders reduced or cancelled. The bankruptcy laws may severely limit our ability to collect pre-petition accounts receivable. If key customers, cease doing business as a result of bankruptcy, or significantly reduce the number of stores operated and therefore the amount of products ordered from us, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including our ability to access availability under our credit facility.\nBecause we rely on foreign suppliers and we sell our products in foreign markets, we are subject to numerous risks associated with international business that could increase our costs or disrupt the supply of our products, resulting in a negative impact on our business and financial condition.\nWhile most of our sales continue to be in North America, we operate facilities and sell products in countries outside the United States. Additionally, as we discuss below, we utilize third-party suppliers and manufacturers located in Asia to produce a majority of our products. These sales and manufacturing operations, including operations in emerging markets that we have entered, may enter, or may increase our presence in, are subject to the risks associated with international operations, including:\n\u2022 economic and political instability;\n\u2022 restrictive actions by foreign governments;\n\u2022 greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 trade restrictions;\n\u2022 work stoppages or other changes in labor conditions;\n\u2022 disease epidemics and health-related concerns, such as the H1N1 virus, coronavirus, or SARS outbreaks in recent years, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of\nraw materials, scrutiny or embargo of goods produced in infected areas, or delays in manufacturing or shipment of products to the U.S.;\n\u2022 reduction in business activity in some parts of the world;\n\u2022 currency fluctuations and devaluations;\n\u2022 changes in import duties or import or export restrictions;\n\u2022 compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations;\n\u2022 untimely shipping of product and unloading of product through West Coast ports, as well as untimely truck delivery to our warehouses;\n\u2022 complications in complying with the laws and policies of the United States affecting the importation of goods, including duties, quotas, and taxes;\n\u2022 limitations on repatriation of foreign earnings; and\n\u2022 complications in complying with foreign tax laws.\nFuture changes to the U.S. tariff and import/export regulations could have a negative effect on our results of operations. Due to our reliance of manufacturers located in China, from which we import a majority of our products, the occurrence of such trade reforms or restrictions could impact our business in an adverse manner.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC resulting in record fines and penalties, increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators, and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. Our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could harm our business and financial condition.\nAlso, because we generate some of our revenue outside the United States but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, our financial results are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. If the U.S. dollar is strong against foreign currencies, our translation of foreign currency denominated revenue or expense could result in lower U.S. dollar denominated net revenue and expense.\nEarthquakes, floods, fire, epidemics or other catastrophic events out of our control may damage or impact the operations of our primary distribution facility and harm our results of operations.\nOur primary distribution facility is located in Riverside, California, near major earthquake faults. A catastrophic event, such as an earthquake, flood, fire, or other natural or manmade disaster, could impact operations at this facility. In addition, the state of California has declared a state of emergency related to the recent coronavirus outbreak, and operations at our distribution facility could be disrupted or required to close if there are any employees who are diagnosed with the coronavirus or there is a governmentally-imposed quarantine or other geographic limitations imposed on companies doing business in California. Any of these events could impair distribution of our products, damage inventory, interrupt critical functions, or otherwise affect our business negatively, harming our results of operations.\nAny adverse change in our relationship with our suppliers could harm our business.\nWe rely on numerous third-party suppliers located in Asia for the manufacture of most of our products. While we believe that alternative suppliers could be located if required, our product sourcing could be affected if any of these suppliers do not continue to manufacture our products in required quantities or at all, or with the required levels of quality. We do not have any long-term supply contracts with our foreign suppliers; rather, we enter into purchase orders with these suppliers. In addition, difficulties encountered by these suppliers in the countries where they operate, such as fire, accident, natural disasters, outbreaks of contagious diseases, or political unrest, could halt or disrupt production at the affected locations, resulting in delay or cancellation of orders. For instance, the recent coronavirus outbreak in China may result in delays in manufacturing of our products due to closure of factories and delays in shipping products to the U.S., which could impact our sale forecasts and inventory levels. Any of these events could result in delayed deliveries by us of our products, causing reduced sales and harm to our reputation and brand name.\nIncreases in the cost of materials or labor used to manufacture our products could decrease our profitability and therefore negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nBecause our products are manufactured by third-party suppliers, we do not directly purchase the materials used in the manufacture of our products. However, the prices paid by us to these suppliers could increase if raw materials, labor, or other costs increase. If we cannot pass these increases along to our customers, our profitability will be adversely affected.\nIntellectual property claims relating to our products could increase our costs and adversely affect our business.\nWe receive, from time to time, claims of alleged infringement of patents relating to certain of our products, and we may face similar claims in the future. The defense of intellectual property claims can be costly and time consuming, even in circumstances where the claim is without merit. We may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs in order to resolve these types of claims. In addition, these claims could materially harm our brand name, reputation and operations.\nAs a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future, violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of future product liability suits, product recalls, and other claims relating to the use of our products, which could harm our business.\nBecause we produce infant and juvenile health, safety and wellness consumer products, we are subject to significant government regulation and face product liability risks relating to consumer use of our products. We must comply with a variety of state and federal product safety and product testing regulations. In particular, our products are subject to the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (\"FHSA\") and the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (\"CPSIA\"), which empower the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the \"CPSC\"), to take action against hazards presented by consumer products. With expanded authority under the CPSIA, the CPSC has and continues to adopt new regulations for safety and products testing that apply to our products. These regulations have or likely will significantly increase the regulatory requirements governing the manufacture and sale of children's products and increase the potential penalties for noncompliance with applicable regulations. The CPSC has the authority to exclude from the market and recall certain consumer products that are found to be potentially hazardous. Consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the United States and in Canada and Europe, as well as certain other countries. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, or if we face product liability claims, we may be subject to damage awards or settlement costs that exceed any available insurance coverage and we may incur significant costs in complying with recall requirements.\nWe maintain a quality control program to help ensure compliance with applicable product safety requirements. Nonetheless, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, issues in products that may lead to product liability, personal injury or property damage claims, recalls, withdrawals, replacements of products, or regulatory actions by governmental authorities. A product recall could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, depending on the product affected by the recall and the extent of the recall efforts required. A product recall could also negatively affect our reputation and the sales of other products. Furthermore, concerns about potential liability may lead us to voluntarily recall selected products. Complying with existing or new regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business operations, decrease sales, increase legal fees and other costs, and put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other manufacturers not affected by similar issues with products, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Similarly, increased penalties for non-compliance could subject us to greater expense if our products were found to not comply with such regulations.\nIn addition to product liability risks relating to the use by consumers of our products, we also must comply with a variety of state and federal laws and regulations which prohibit unfair or deceptive trade practices, including dissemination of false or misleading advertising. While we take steps that we believe are necessary to comply with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will always be in compliance. Compliance with these various laws and regulations could impose significant costs on our business if we fail to comply, and could result in monetary liabilities and other penalties and lead to significant negative media attention and consumer dissatisfaction, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success is dependent in part on our executive officers, and management turnover can create uncertainties and could disrupt and impact our business.\nOur success depends in part on the efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel. Changes in our company as a result of management transition, including the fact that our current Chief Executive Officer is serving on an interim basis, can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause disruption to our business due to, among other things, diverting management's attention away from the Company's day-to-day business, negatively impacting relationships with our key retail customers, suppliers and employees, or causing a deterioration in workplace morale. If our interim CEO were to resign, we would be forced to expend significant time and money in the pursuit of a replacement.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities that, if not identified, could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by nondeductible equity-based compensation, earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, transfer pricing adjustments, not meeting the terms and conditions of tax holidays or incentives, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in actual results versus our estimates, or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, and taxes relating to deemed dividends resulting from foreign guarantees made by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. In addition, like other companies, we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. While we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nA material impairment in the carrying value of other intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nA portion of our assets are intangible, which are reviewed on an annual basis and/or whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current fair value, the asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value, resulting in a non-cash charge to earnings during the period in which any impairment is determined. If we make changes in our business strategy, our future operating performance was to fall significantly below forecast levels or if external conditions adversely affect our business operations, we may be required to record an impairment charge for intangibles, which would lead to decreased assets and reduced net operating results and net worth.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our information systems from cyberattacks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, including personal data, damage our reputation, disrupt our operations and subject us to significant financial and legal exposure.\nWe rely on information technology systems, including systems managed by third parties, across our operations, including for management of our supply chain, sale and delivery of our products, and various other processes and transactions, including credit card processing for online sales. In the course of our operations, we may collect and use confidential customer data and a variety of personal data. A successful cyberattack could result in the theft or destruction of intellectual property, data, or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Cyberattacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, including wrongful conduct by hostile foreign governments, industrial espionage, wire fraud and other forms of cyber fraud, the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service and social engineering fraud. Cyberattacks have become increasingly difficult to detect, and a successful cyberattack could cause serious negative consequences for us, including the disruption of operations and the misappropriation of confidential business information or personal data. Although we devote resources to protect our information systems, we realize that cyberattacks are a threat, and there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent information security breaches that would result in business, legal, financial or reputational harm to us, or would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, use of, or disclosure of personal data could result in significant liability under state, federal and international laws regarding data privacy, and may cause a material adverse impact to our reputation and potentially disrupt our business.\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. When we or our competitors announce new products, experience quarterly fluctuations in operating results, announce strategic relationships, acquisitions or dispositions, change earnings estimates, publish financial results or other material news, our stock price is often affected. The volatility of our stock price may be accentuated during periods of low volume trading, which may require a stockholder wishing to sell a large number of shares to do so in increments over time to mitigate any adverse impact of the sales on the market price of our stock.\nWe may not be able to maintain our listing on Nasdaq.\nOur common stock currently trades on The Nasdaq Capital Market. This market has continued listing requirements that we must continue to maintain to avoid delisting, including, among others, a minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share and any of: (i) a minimum stockholders' equity of $2.5 million; (ii) a market value of listed securities of $35 million; or (iii) net income from continuing operations of $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the last three fiscal years.\nOur results of operations and our fluctuating stock price directly impact our ability to satisfy these listing standards. If we are unable to maintain these listing standards, we may be subject to delisting. In 2019, we received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market notifying us that we are not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. In order to regain compliance with this requirement, on March 13, 2020 we implemented a 1-for-9 reverse stock split. As of March 16, 2020, the closing bid price of our common stock was $2.55 per share. However, there is no guarantee that our stock price will remain above $1.00, and the history of similar reverse stock splits for companies in like circumstances is varied. A delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market would result in our common stock being eligible for quotation on \"over-the-counter\" markets, which is generally considered to be a less efficient system than listing on markets such as Nasdaq or other national exchanges because of lower trading volumes, transaction delays and reduced security analyst and news media coverage. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock. Additionally, trading of our common stock on over-the-counter markets may make us less desirable to institutional investors and may, therefore, limit our future equity financing options and could negatively affect the liquidity of our stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may limit the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our Company and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, which may not be in your best interests.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us, even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. These provisions in our certificate of incorporation include authorization for our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred stock issued, and to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or change in control. Our bylaws require advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nAdditionally, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, in general, imposes restrictions upon acquirers of 15% or more of our stock. Finally, the Board of Directors may in the future adopt other protective measures, such as a stockholder rights plan, which could delay, deter or prevent a change of control.", "PERMNO": 91909, "SIC": 3990, "TIC": "SUMR"}
