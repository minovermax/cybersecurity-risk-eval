{"cik": "1403475", "company": "Bank of Marin Bancorp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nWe assume and manage a certain degree of risk in order to conduct our business. The material risks and uncertainties that Management believes may affect our business are listed below and in ITEM 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk. The list is not exhaustive; additional risks and uncertainties that Management is not aware of, or focused on, or currently deems immaterial may also impair business operations. If any of the following risks, or risks that have not been identified, actually occur, our financial condition, results of operations, and stock trading price could be materially and adversely affected. We manage these risks by promoting sound corporate governance practices, which include but are not limited to, establishing policies and internal controls, and implementing internal review processes. Before making an investment decision, investors should carefully consider the risks, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nEarnings are Significantly Influenced by General Business and Economic Conditions\nOur success depends, to a certain extent, on local, national and global economic and political conditions. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in the State of California with particular focus on the local markets in the San Francisco Bay Area. The local economic conditions in this area have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposits as our primary funding source. Economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding the sustainability of economic improvements may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and saving habits, which may affect the demand for loans and other products and services we offer. Further, loan defaults that adversely affect our earnings correlate highly with deteriorating economic conditions (such as the unemployment rate), which impact our borrowers' creditworthiness. In addition, health epidemics or pandemics (or expectations about them) such as the novel coronavirus (aka \"COVID-19\"), international trade disputes, inflation risks, oil price volatility, the level of U.S. debt and global economic conditions could destabilize financial markets in which we operate. Lastly, actions of the Federal Open Market Committee (\"FOMC\") of the Federal Reserve could cause financial market volatility, which will affect the pricing of our loan and deposit products.\nInterest Rate Risk is Inherent in Our Business\nOur earnings are largely dependent upon our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. The banking industry is facing headwinds of interest margin compression coming into 2020 due to a flatter yield curve compared to previous years. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the FOMC, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, can influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but can also affect (i) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the duration of our securities and loan portfolios. Our portfolio of loans and securities will generally decline in value if market interest rates increase, and increase in value if market interest rates decline. In addition, our loans and callable mortgage-backed securities are also subject to prepayment risk when interest rates fall, and the borrowers' credit risk may increase in rising rate environments. Factors such as inflation, productivity, oil prices, unemployment rates, and global demand play a role in the FOMC's consideration of future rate adjustments. On March 3, 2020, in light of the challenges brought by coronavirus and its potential to disrupt the U.S. and worldwide economies, the FOMC reduced the federal funds target rate by 50 basis points to a range of 1.0% to 1.25%. In a press conference on March 3, 2020, Chairman Powell stated that the FOMC \"took this action to help the U.S. economy keep strong in the face of new risks to the economic outlook.\"\nOur net interest income is vulnerable to a falling or flat rate environment and will benefit if the prevailing market interest rates increase in the long-term. See the sections captioned \u201cNet Interest Income\u201d in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in ITEM 7 and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in ITEM 7A of this report for further discussion related to management of interest rate risk.\nPage-12\nBanks and Bank Holding Companies are Subject to Extensive Government Regulation and Supervision\nBancorp and the Bank are subject to extensive federal and state governmental supervision, regulation and control. Holding company regulations affect the range of activities in which Bancorp is engaged. Banking regulations affect the Bank's lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, and compliance costs among other things. Compliance risk is the current and prospective risk to earnings or capital arising from violations of, or non-conformance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, or ethical standards set forth by regulators. Compliance risk also arises in situations where the laws or rules governing certain bank products or activities of our clients may be ambiguous or untested. This risk exposes Bancorp and the Bank to potential fines, civil money penalties, payment of damages and the voiding of contracts. Compliance risk can lead to diminished reputation, reduced franchise value, limited business opportunities, reduced expansion potential and an inability to enforce contracts. The Bank manages these risks through its extensive compliance plan, policies and procedures. For further information on supervision and regulation, see the section captioned \u201cSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\u201d in ITEM 1 of this report.\nCompetition with Other Financial Institutions to Attract and Retain Banking Customers\nWe are facing significant competition for customers from other banks and financial institutions located in the markets that we serve. We compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, non-bank financial services companies, including financial technology firms, and other financial institutions operating within or near our service areas. Some of our non-bank competitors and peer-to-peer lenders may not be subject to the same extensive regulations as we are, giving them greater flexibility in competing for business. We anticipate intense competition will continue for the coming year due to the consolidation of many financial institutions and more changes in legislation, regulation and technology. National and regional banks much larger than our size have entered our market through acquisitions and they may be able to benefit from economies of scale through their wider branch networks, more prominent national advertising campaigns, lower cost of borrowing, capital market access and sophisticated technology infrastructures. Further, intense competition for creditworthy borrowers could lead to pressure for loan rate concessions and affect our ability to generate profitable loans.\nGoing forward, we may see continued competition in the industry as competitors seek to expand market share in our core markets. Further, our customers may withdraw deposits to pursue alternative investment opportunities in the recent bullish equity market. Technology and other changes have made it more convenient for bank customers to transfer funds into alternative investments or other deposit accounts such as online virtual banks and non-bank service providers. Efforts and initiatives we may undertake to retain and increase deposits, including deposit pricing, can increase our costs. Based on our current strong liquidity position, our adjustment to deposit pricing has lagged the market in a rising interest rate environment. If our customers move money into higher yielding deposits or alternative investments, we may lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds, thus increasing our funding costs through more expensive wholesale borrowings.\nActivities of Our Large Borrowers and Depositors May Cause Unexpected Volatilities in Our Loan and Deposit Balances, as well as Net Interest Margin\nRising real estate values in the Bay Area market have motivated some of our borrowers to sell real estate that collateralized our loans, contributing to loan payoff activity. Payoffs of loans originated during a higher interest rate environment may be replaced by new loans with lower interest rates, causing downward pressure on our net interest margin. In addition, our top ten depositor relationships accounted for approximately 16% and 11% of our total deposit balances at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in 2019 primarily relates to funds deposited by a large existing deposit customer whose deposit volatility increases leading to and during an election year. In addition, the business models and cash cycles of some of our large commercial depositors may also cause short-term volatility in their deposit balances held with us. As our customers' businesses grow, the dollar value of their daily activities may also grow leading to larger fluctuations in daily balances. Any long-term decline in deposit funding would adversely affect our liquidity. For additional information on our management of deposit volatility, refer to the Liquidity section of ITEM 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, of this report.\nPage-13\nNegative Conditions Affecting Real Estate May Harm Our Business and Our Commercial Real Estate (\"CRE\") Concentration May Heighten Such Risk\nConcentration of our lending activities in the California real estate sector could negatively affect our results of operations if adverse changes in our lending area occur. Although we do not offer traditional first mortgages, nor have sub-prime or Alt-A residential loans or significant amounts of securities backed by such loans in the portfolio, we are not immune to volatility in those markets. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 88% of our loans were secured by real estate, of which 68% were secured by CRE and the remaining 22% by residential real estate. Real estate valuations are influenced by demand, and demand is driven by economic factors such as employment rates and interest rates.\nLoans secured by CRE include those secured by office buildings, owner-user office/warehouses, mixed-use residential/commercial properties and retail properties. There can be no assurance that the companies or properties securing our loans will generate sufficient cash flows to allow borrowers to make full and timely loan payments to us. In the event of default, the collateral value may not cover the outstanding amount due to us, especially during real estate market downturns.\nRising CRE lending concentrations may expose institutions to unanticipated earnings and capital volatility in the event of adverse changes in the CRE market. Concentration risk exists when financial institutions deploy too many assets to any one industry or segment. Concentration stemming from commercial real estate is one area of regulatory concern. The CRE Concentration Guidance provides supervisory criteria, including the following numerical indicators, to assist bank examiners in identifying banks with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) commercial real estate loans exceeding 300% of capital and increasing 50% or more in the preceding three years; or (ii) construction and land development loans exceeding 100% of capital. The CRE Concentration Guidance does not limit banks\u2019 levels of commercial real estate lending activities, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, using regulatory definitions in the CRE Concentration Guidance, our CRE loans represented 330% and 340%, respectively, of our total risk-based capital. We are actively working to manage our CRE concentration and we have discussed the CRE Concentration Guidance with the regulatory agencies and believe that our underwriting policies, management information systems, independent credit administration process, and monitoring of real estate loan concentrations are currently sufficient to address the CRE Concentration Guidance.\nSevere Weather, Natural Disasters or Other Climate Change Related Matters Could Significantly Affect Our Business\nOur primary market is located in both earthquake and wildfire-prone zones in Northern California, which is also subject to other weather or disasters, such as severe rainstorms, drought or flood. These events have interrupted our business operations unexpectedly (e.g., October 2019 PG&E power shutoff's in the North Bay). Climate-related physical changes and hazards could also pose credit risks for us. For example, our borrowers may have collateral properties or operations located in areas at risk of wildfires, or coastal areas at risk to rising sea levels and erosion, or subject to the risk of drought in California. The properties pledged as collateral on our loan portfolio could also be damaged by tsunamis, landslides, floods, earthquakes or wildfires and thereby the recoverability of loans could be impaired. A number of factors can affect credit losses, including the extent of damage to the collateral, the extent of damage not covered by insurance, the extent to which unemployment and other economic conditions caused by the natural disaster adversely affect the ability of borrowers to repay their loans, and the cost of collection and foreclosure to us. Lastly, there could be increased insurance premiums and deductibles, or a decrease in the availability of coverage, due to severe weather-related losses. The ultimate outcome on our business of a natural disaster, whether or not caused by climate change, is difficult to predict.\nWe are Subject to Significant Credit Risk and Loan Losses May Exceed Our Allowance for Loan Losses in the Future\nThe operation of our business requires us to manage credit risk. As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms, and that the collateral securing repayment of their loans, if any, may not be sufficient to ensure repayment. In addition, there are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks relating to proper loan underwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers. In order to successfully manage credit risk, we must, among other things, maintain disciplined\nPage-14\nand prudent underwriting standards and ensure that our bankers follow those standards. The weakening of these standards for any reason, such as an attempt to attract higher yielding loans, a lack of discipline or diligence by our employees in underwriting and monitoring loans, the inability of our employees to adequately adapt policies and procedures to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting borrowers and the quality of our loan portfolio, may result in loan defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs and may necessitate that we significantly increase our allowance for loan losses, each of which could adversely affect our net income. As a result, any inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses that represents Management's best estimate of probable losses that may be incurred within the existing portfolio of loans (under the \"incurred loss model\"). The level of the allowance reflects Management's continuing evaluation of specific credit risks, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality and present economic, political and regulatory conditions. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Inaccurate assumptions in appraisals or an inappropriate choice of the valuation techniques may lead to an inadequate level of specific reserve or charge-offs. If charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses or cash flows from acquired loans do not perform as expected, we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses.\nThe adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments as of January 1, 2020 will impact how we measure the allowance for credit losses as the methodology is based on a current expected credit loss (\"CECL\") model, rather than incurred losses, and requires the recognition of credit loss expense in the consolidated statements of income and a related allowance for credit losses at the time of origination or purchase of a loan receivable or held-to-maturity debt security. In addition, the CECL model requires the use of not only relevant historical experience and current conditions, but reasonable and supportable forecasts of future events and circumstances (e.g., economic forecasts) incorporating a broad range of information in developing credit loss estimates, which could result in significant changes to both the timing and amount of credit loss expense and allowance. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in ITEM 8 for further information.\nSecurities May Lose Value due to Credit Quality of the Issuers\nWe invest in significant portions of investment securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises (\"GSE\"), such as Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\"), Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFNMA\u201d), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\"FHLMC\"), and Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation. We also hold mortgage-backed securities (\u201cMBS\u201d) issued by FNMA and FHLMC, both of which have been under U.S. Government conservatorship since 2008. While we consider FNMA and FHLMC securities to have low credit risk as they carry the explicit backing of the U.S. Government due to the conservatorship, they are not direct obligations of the U.S. Government and the fair value of our securities issued or guaranteed by these two GSE entities may be negatively impacted if the U.S. government ceases to provide them credit support. GSE debt is sponsored but not guaranteed by the federal government and carries implicit backing, whereas government agencies such as Government National Mortgage Association (\"GNMA\") are divisions of the government whose securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.\nAlthough Congress has taken steps to improve regulation and consumer protection related to the housing finance system (e.g., Dodd-Frank Act), FNMA and FHLMC have entered their twelfth year of U.S. Government conservatorship via the Federal Housing Finance Agency (the \"FHFA\"). In September 2019, the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued a Housing Finance Reform Plan that, among other things, directed the Secretary of the Treasury to develop a Roadmap to begin the process of responsibly ending the GSEs' conservatorships. In February 2020, the FHFA hired a financial advisor to assist with the development and implementation of the Roadmap, which will include business and capital structures, as well as market impacts, and timing and available capital raising alternatives. While proposals to end the conservatorship may include an initial public offering, at the date of this report, its future and ultimate impact on the financial markets and our investments in GSEs are uncertain.\nWhile we generally seek to minimize our exposure by diversifying the geographic location of our portfolio, investing in investment grade securities and actively monitoring the credit worthiness of the issuers and/or credit guarantee providers, there is no guarantee that the issuers will remain financially sound or continue their payments on these debentures.\nPage-15\nUnexpected Early Termination of Interest Rate Swap Agreements May Affect Earnings\nWe have entered into interest-rate swap agreements, primarily as an asset/liability risk management tool, in order to mitigate the changes in the fair value of specified long-term fixed-rate loans and firm commitments to enter into long-term fixed-rate loans caused by changes in interest rates. These hedges allow us to offer long-term, fixed-rate loans to customers without assuming the interest rate risk of a long-term asset by swapping our fixed-rate interest stream for a floating-rate interest stream. In the event of default by the borrowers on our hedged loans, we may have to terminate these designated interest-rate swap agreements early, resulting in prepayment penalties charged by our counterparties and negatively affect our earnings.\nGrowth Strategy or Potential Future Acquisitions May Produce Unfavorable Outcomes\nWe seek to expand our franchise safely and consistently. A successful growth strategy requires us to manage multiple aspects of the business simultaneously, such as following adequate loan underwriting standards, balancing loan and deposit growth without increasing interest rate risk or compressing our net interest margin, maintaining sufficient capital, and recruiting, training and retaining qualified professionals.\nOur strategic plan also includes merger and acquisition possibilities that either enhance our market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services, such as the Bank of Napa acquisition in 2017. We may incur significant acquisition related expenses either during the due diligence phase of acquisition targets or during integration of the acquirees. These expenses have and may continue to negatively impact our earnings prior to realizing the benefits of acquisitions. We may also be exposed to difficulties in combining the operations of acquired institutions into our own operations, which may prevent us from achieving the expected benefits from our acquisition activities. Our earnings, financial condition and prospects after the merger may affect our stock price and will depend in part on our ability to integrate the operations and management of the acquired institution while continuing to implement other aspects of our business plan. Inherent uncertainties exist in integrating the operations of an acquired institution and there is no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully. Among the issues that we could face are:\n\u2022\nunexpected problems with operations, personnel, technology or credit;\n\u2022\nloss of customers and employees of the acquiree;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in working with the acquiree's employees and customers;\n\u2022\nthe assimilation of the acquiree's operations, culture and personnel;\n\u2022\ninstituting and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; and\n\u2022\nlitigation risk not discovered during the due diligence period.\nUndiscovered factors as a result of an acquisition could bring liabilities against us, our management and the management of the institutions we acquire. These factors could contribute to our not achieving the expected benefits from our acquisitions within desired time frames, if at all. Further, although we generally anticipate cost savings from acquisitions, we may not be able to fully realize those savings. Any cost savings may be offset by losses in revenues or other charges to earnings.\nWe May Not Be Able to Attract and Retain Key Employees\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract qualified personnel and to retain key people, as well as the prompt replacement of retiring executives. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged by us has been intense, especially in light of the recent improvement in the job market, and we may not be able to hire skilled people or retain them. The loss of key personnel could have an unfavorable effect on our business because of the need for prompt replacement of skills and knowledge of our market and years of industry experience.\nAccounting Estimates and Risk Management Processes Rely on Analytical and Forecasting Models\nThe processes we use to estimate probable loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in\nPage-16\ntheir design or their implementation. If the models we use for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, we may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models we use for determining our probable loan losses are inadequate, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If the models we use to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what we could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in our analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Value of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets May Decline in the Future\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had goodwill totaling $30.1 million and a core deposit intangible asset totaling $4.7 million from business acquisitions. A significant decline in expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock could necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe May Take Filing Positions or Follow Tax Strategies That May Be Subject to Challenge\nWe provide for current and deferred tax provision in our consolidated financial statements based on our results of operations, business activities and business combinations, legal structure and federal and state legislation and regulations. We may take filing positions or follow tax strategies that are subject to interpretation of tax statutes. Our net income may be reduced if a federal, state or local authority were to assess charges for taxes that have not been provided for in our consolidated financial statements. Taxing authorities could change applicable tax laws and interpretations, challenge filing positions or assess new taxes and interest charges. If taxing authorities take any of these actions, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be significantly affected.\nThe Financial Services Industry is Undergoing Rapid Technological Changes and, As a Result, We Have a Continuing Need to Stay Current with Those Changes to Compete Effectively and Increase Our Efficiencies. We May Not Have the Resources to Implement New Technology to Stay Current with These Changes\nThe financial services industry is undergoing technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to providing better client service, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and reduces operational costs. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to use technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands securely and cost-effectively. In connection with implementing new technology enhancements and/or products, we may experience operational challenges (e.g. human error, system error, incompatibility) which could result in us not fully realizing the anticipated benefits from such new technology or require us to incur significant costs to remedy any such challenges in a timely manner.\nRisks Associated with Cybersecurity Could Negatively Affect Our Earnings and Reputation\nOur business requires the secure management of sensitive client and bank information. We work diligently to implement security measures that intend to make our communications and information systems safe to conduct business. Cyber threats such as social engineering, ransomware, and phishing emails are more prevalent now than ever before. These incidents include intentional and unintentional events that may present threats designed to disrupt operations, corrupt data, release sensitive information or cause denial-of-service attacks. A cybersecurity breach of systems operated by the Bank, merchants, vendors, customers, or externally publicized breaches of other financial institutions may significantly harm our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and financial liability. While we have systems and procedures designed to prevent security breaches, we cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, physical system or network break-ins or inappropriate access will not compromise or breach the technology protecting our networks or proprietary client information. If a material security breach were to occur, the Bank has policies and procedures in place to ensure timely disclosure.\nWe Rely on Third-Party Vendors for Important Aspects of Our Operation\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information and systems provided by certain key vendors, including but not limited to data processing, payroll processing, technology support, investment safekeeping and accounting.\nPage-17\nFor example, we outsource core processing to Fidelity Information Services (\"FIS\") and wire processing to Finastra, which are leading financial services solution providers that allow us access to competitive technology offerings without having to invest in their development. Our ability to operate, as well as our financial condition and results of operations, could be negatively affected in the event of an interruption of an information system, an undetected error, a cyber-breach, or in the event of a natural disaster whereby certain vendors are unable to maintain business continuity.\nBancorp Relies on Dividends from the Bank to Pay Cash Dividends to Shareholders\nBancorp is a separate legal entity from its subsidiary, the Bank. Bancorp receives substantially all of its cash stream from the Bank in the form of dividends, which is Bancorp's principal source of funds to pay cash dividends to Bancorp's common shareholders, service subordinated debt, and cover operational expenses of the holding company. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to Bancorp. In the event that the Bank is unable to pay dividends to Bancorp, Bancorp may not be able to pay dividends to its shareholders or pay interest on the subordinated debentures. As a result, it could have an adverse effect on Bancorp's stock price and investment value.\nFederal law would prohibit capital distributions from the Bank, with limited exceptions, if the Bank were categorized as \"undercapitalized\" under applicable Federal Reserve or FDIC regulations. In addition, as a California bank, Bank of Marin is subject to state law restrictions on the payment of dividends. For further information on the distribution limit from the Bank to Bancorp, see the section captioned \u201cBank Regulation\u201d in ITEM 1 above and \u201cDividends\u201d in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in ITEM 8 of this report.\nThe Trading Volume of Bancorp's Common Stock is Less than That of Other, Larger Financial Services Companies\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market exchange. Our trading volume is less than that of nationwide or larger regional financial institutions. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence of willing buyers and sellers of common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the low trading volume of our common stock, significant trades of our stock in a given time, or the expectations of these trades, could cause volatility in the stock price.\nThe Small to Medium-sized Businesses that we Lend to may have Fewer Resources to Weather Adverse Business Developments, which may Impair a Borrower's Ability to Repay a Loan, and such Impairment could Adversely Affect our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nWe focus our business development and marketing strategy primarily on small to medium-sized businesses. Small to medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower's ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small and medium-sized business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two people or a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could adversely affect the business and its ability to repay its loan. If general economic conditions negatively affect the California markets in which we operate and small to medium-sized businesses are adversely affected or our borrowers are otherwise affected by adverse business developments, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nA Lack of Liquidity could Adversely Affect our Operations and Jeopardize our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nLiquidity is essential to our business. We rely on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of our loans and investment securities, respectively, to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, securities sales, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our most important source of funds consists of deposits. Deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return trade-off. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other\nPage-18\ninvestments, then we would lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income.\nOther primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations, investment maturities and sales, loan repayments, and proceeds from the issuance and sale of any equity and debt securities to investors. Additional liquidity is provided by the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the Federal Home Loan Bank and our ability to raise brokered deposits. We also may borrow funds from third-party lenders, such as other financial institutions. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities, or on terms that are acceptable to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the bank or non-bank financial services industries or the economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the bank or non-bank financial services industries. For example, in September 2019, in response to a shortage in liquidity and spikes in the overnight bank funding rate, the New York Federal Reserve began injecting liquidity into the market in the form of overnight market repurchase agreements (\"repos\") designed to smooth money markets and bring interest rates in line with the central bank's intended range to sustain economic expansion. The availability of liquidity during financial market disruptions such as the repo rate spike is uncertain and the continued liquidity support by the central bank is not guaranteed.\nBased on experience, we believe that our deposit accounts are relatively stable sources of funds. If we increase interest rates paid to retain deposits, our earnings may be adversely affected, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely affect our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, and pay dividends to our shareholders or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to, or Elimination of, London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) Could Adversely Affect our Financial Instruments with Interest Rates Currently Indexed to LIBOR\nIn 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom (the \u201cFCA\u201d) announced its intention to cease sustaining LIBOR after 2021. While the FCA came to an agreement with panel banks to continue receiving submissions to LIBOR until the end of 2021, it is not possible to predict whether and how credible LIBOR will be as an acceptable market benchmark. The FCA is encouraging due diligence and implementation of alternative rates prior to the phase out of LIBOR. While there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), a steering committee comprised of U.S. financial market participants selected by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, published recommended fall-back language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments and identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by Treasury securities, for U.S. Dollar LIBOR). At this time, we cannot predict whether ARRC's specific recommendations or proposals will be widely accepted and what effect their implementation will have on floating rate financial instrument markets. Banks like us may need to amend contracts to reference SOFR and identify an acceptable spread to LIBOR or amend the definition of LIBOR through a specific grandfathering protocol.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had loans totaling approximately $1 million and investment securities totaling approximately $27 million indexed to LIBOR that mature after December 31, 2021. In addition, our interest rate swap agreements and subordinated debentures are indexed to LIBOR, all of which mature after December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 7 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in ITEM 8 of this report for more information on our swap agreements and subordinated debentures. The transition from LIBOR could result in additional costs, as well as economic and reputation risk. At this time, we cannot predict any favorable or unfavorable effects the chosen alternative index may have on financial instruments currently indexed to LIBOR.", "PERMNO": 87476, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BMRC"}
