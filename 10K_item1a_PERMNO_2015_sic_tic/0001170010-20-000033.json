{"cik": "1170010", "company": "CARMAX INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-04-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks, the most significant of which are described below. Our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.\nThe recent outbreak of COVID-19 will likely have a significant negative impact on our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 has led to severe disruptions in general economic activities, particularly retail operations, as businesses and federal, state, and local governments take increasingly broad actions to mitigate this public health crisis. We have experienced significant disruption to our business, both in terms of disruption of our operations and the adverse effect on overall economic conditions. We have closed or limited operations at many of our retail and wholesale locations since the beginning of the outbreak and the ultimate scope and duration of these closures is not known. For stores that remain open, consumer demand has deteriorated. These conditions will significantly negatively impact all aspects of our business, including used vehicle sales operations, wholesale vehicle auctions, used vehicle financing, extended protection plan sales, inventory acquisition, and retail service. The unexpected deterioration in economic conditions may also lead to future credit losses in our portfolio of auto loans receivable that are not incorporated in the existing allowance for loan losses. Our business is also dependent on the continued health and productivity of our associates, including store, region and corporate management teams, throughout this crisis. Individually and collectively, the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, our liquidity could be negatively impacted if these conditions continue for a significant period of time and we may be required to pursue additional sources of financing to obtain working capital, maintain appropriate inventory levels, support the origination of auto loans receivable, and meet our financial obligations. Currently capital and credit markets have been disrupted by the crisis and our ability to obtain any required financing is not guaranteed and largely dependent upon evolving market conditions and other factors. Depending on the continued impact of the crisis, further actions may be required to improve the Company's cash position and capital structure.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak ultimately impacts our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience significant impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any economic downturn or recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nThe automotive retail industry in general and our business in particular are sensitive to economic conditions. These conditions could adversely affect our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to national and regional U.S. economic conditions. These conditions include, but are not limited to, recession, inflation, interest rates, unemployment levels, the state of the housing market, gasoline prices, consumer credit availability, consumer credit delinquency and loss rates, personal discretionary spending levels, and consumer sentiment about the economy in general. These conditions and the economy in general could be affected by significant national or international events such as a global health crisis, like COVID-19, and acts of terrorism. When these economic conditions worsen or stagnate, it can have a material adverse effect on consumer demand for vehicles generally, demand from particular consumer categories or demand for particular vehicle types. It can also negatively impact availability of credit to finance vehicle purchases for all or certain categories of consumers. This could result in lower sales, decreased margins on units sold, and decreased profits for our CAF segment. Worsening or stagnating economic conditions can also have a material adverse effect on the supply of late-model used vehicles, as automotive manufacturers produce fewer new vehicles and consumers retain their current vehicles for longer periods of time. This could result in increased costs to acquire used vehicle inventory and decreased margins on units sold.\nAny significant change or deterioration in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is dependent upon capital to operate, fund growth and support the activities of our CAF segment. Changes in capital and credit markets could adversely affect our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in the availability or cost of capital and working capital financing, including the long-term financing to support the expansion of our store base and sales growth in existing stores, could adversely affect sales, operating strategies and store growth. Although, in recent years, internally generated cash flows have been sufficient to maintain our operations and fund our growth, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate sufficient cash for these purposes. Failure to do so-or our decision to put our cash to other uses-would make us more dependent on external sources of financing to fund our growth.\nChanges in the availability or cost of the long-term financing to support the origination of auto loans receivable through CAF could adversely affect sales and results of operations. We use a securitization program to fund the majority of the auto loans\nreceivable originated by CAF. Changes in the condition of the asset-backed securitization market could lead us to incur higher costs to access funds in this market or require us to seek alternative means to finance CAF\u2019s loan originations. In the event that this market ceased to exist and there were no immediate alternative funding sources available, we might be forced to curtail our lending practices for some period of time. The impact of reducing or curtailing CAF\u2019s loan originations could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nOur revolving credit facility, term loan, senior unsecured notes and certain securitization and sale-leaseback agreements contain covenants and performance triggers. Any failure to comply with these covenants or performance triggers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility. If our ability to secure funds from the facility were significantly impaired, our access to working capital would be impacted, our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels could be affected and these conditions-especially if coupled with a failure to generate significant cash flows-could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. Failure to develop and execute strategies to remain the nation\u2019s preferred retailer of used vehicles and to adapt to the increasing use of the internet to market, buy, sell and finance used vehicles could adversely affect our business, sales and results of operations.\nAutomotive retailing is a highly competitive and highly fragmented business. Our competition includes publicly and privately owned new and used car dealers and online and mobile sales platforms, as well as millions of private individuals. Competitors buy and sell the same or similar makes of vehicles that we offer in the same or similar markets at competitive prices. New car dealers leverage their franchise relationships with automotive manufacturers to brand certain used cars as \u201ccertified pre-owned,\u201d which could provide those competitors with an advantage over CarMax.\nRetail Competition. Some of our competitors have replicated or attempted to replicate portions of the consumer offer that we pioneered when we opened our first used car store in 1993, including our use of competitive, no-haggle prices and our commitment to buy a customer\u2019s vehicle even if they do not purchase one from us.\nCompetitors using online focused business models, both for direct sales and consumer-to-consumer facilitation, could materially impact our business model. The online availability of used vehicle information, including pricing information, could make it more difficult for us to differentiate our customer offering from competitors\u2019 offerings, could result in lower-than-expected retail margins, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. If we fail to respond effectively to our retail competitors, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nOnline Facilitation. In addition, our competitive standing is affected by companies, including search engines and online classified sites, that are not direct competitors but that may direct online traffic to the websites of competing automotive retailers. The increasing activities of these companies could make it more difficult for carmax.com to attract traffic. These companies could also make it more difficult for CarMax to otherwise market its vehicles online.\nThe increasing use of the internet to facilitate consumers\u2019 sales or trade-ins of their current vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our vehicle acquisition costs and results of operations. For example, online appraisal tools are available to consumers that generate offers and facilitate purchases by dealers other than CarMax.\nIn addition, there are companies that sell software and data solutions to new and used car dealers to enable those dealers to, among other things, more efficiently source and price inventory. Although these companies do not compete with CarMax, the increasing use of such products by dealers who compete with CarMax could reduce the relative competitive advantage of CarMax\u2019s internally developed proprietary systems.\nIf we fail to respond effectively to competitive pressures or to changes in the used vehicle marketplace, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nCAF Competition. Our CAF segment is subject to competition from various financial institutions, including banks and credit unions, which provide vehicle financing to consumers. If we were unable to continue providing competitive finance offers to our customers through CAF, it could result in a greater percentage of sales financed through our third-party finance providers, which are generally less profitable to CarMax, or through other outside financing sources. Moreover, if CAF competitors are able to attract potential customers before they visit CarMax, whether through competitive finance offers or ease of customer experience, they may be directed to retail options other than CarMax. Accordingly, if CAF was unable to continue making competitive finance\noffers to our customers, or our finance competitors are able to successfully attract and redirect a disproportionate number of our potential customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nEvolving Marketplace. The marketplace for used vehicles may be impacted by the significant, and likely accelerating, changes to the broader automotive industry. Technological changes, including the development of autonomous vehicles, new products and services, new business models and new methods of travel could reduce automotive retail demand or disrupt our current business model. If we fail to respond effectively to the evolving marketplace, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nCarMax was founded on the fundamental principle of integrity. Failure to maintain a reputation of integrity and to otherwise maintain and enhance our brand could adversely affect our business, sales and results of operations.\nOur reputation as a company that is founded on the fundamental principle of integrity is critical to our success. Our reputation as a retailer offering competitive, no-haggle prices, a broad selection of CarMax Quality Certified used vehicles and superior customer service is also critical to our success. If we fail to maintain the high standards on which our reputation is built, or if an event occurs that damages this reputation, it could adversely affect consumer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. Such an event could include an isolated incident at a single store, particularly if such incident results in adverse publicity, governmental investigations, or litigation and could involve, among other things, our sales process, our provision of financing, our reconditioning process, or our treatment of customers. Even the perception of a decrease in the quality of our brand could impact results.\nThe use of social media increases the speed with which information and opinions can be shared and thus the speed with which reputation can be affected. We monitor social media and attempt to address customer concerns, provide accurate information and protect our reputation, but there can be no guarantee that our efforts will succeed. If we fail to correct or mitigate misinformation or negative information, including information spread through social media or traditional media channels, about the vehicles we offer, our customer experience, or any aspect of our brand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nOur failure to realize the benefits associated with our omni-channel initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nWe announced the rollout of a new omni-channel experience in December 2018, and by the end of fiscal 2020, our omni-channel experience was available to more than 60% of customers. For our remaining markets, we are pivoting to focus on rolling out the most pertinent parts of the experience as quickly and broadly as possible given current customer needs. If we fail to complete this rollout, if we are inefficient in implementing this rollout or if we are unable to capture the benefits that we expect from this rollout, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. We must anticipate and meet our customers\u2019 expectations in an evolving retail industry. Our business, sales and results of operations may be negatively affected if we fail to provide a high quality and consistent customer experience, regardless of sales channel, if our omni-channel experience does not meet customer expectations, or if we are unable to attract, retain and manage the personnel at various levels who have the necessary skills and experience we need to implement our omni-channel initiatives.\nOur success depends upon the continued contributions of our associates.\nIn April 2020, in response to the COVID-19 situation, we announced approximately 15,500 associates have been placed on furlough, effective April 18, 2020. Our associates are the driving force behind our success. We believe that one of the things that sets CarMax apart is a culture centered on valuing all associates. If we fail to maintain our culture while responding to the COVID-19 situation or in the aftermath of recovery and reintegration of furloughed associates, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nIn addition, our response to COVID-19 as well as our strategic initiatives require management, employees and contractors to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities. Our failure to maintain this culture or to continue developing and retaining the associates that drive our success could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nIn response to COVID-19, we have instituted a hiring freeze. Once that freeze is lifted, we will need to recruit new associates and our ability to recruit associates while controlling related costs is subject to numerous external and internal factors, including unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, our growth plans, changes in employment legislation, and competition for qualified employees in the industry and regions in which we operate and for service technicians in particular. Our ability to recruit associates while controlling related costs is also subject to our ability to maintain positive associate relations. If we are unable to do so, or\nif, despite our efforts, we become subject to successful unionization efforts, it could increase costs, limit our ability to respond to competitive threats and have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nOur response to COVID-19 and our ongoing success also depend upon the continued contributions of our store, region and corporate management teams. Consequently, the loss of the services of any of these associates could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. In addition, an inability to build our management bench strength to support store growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nWe collect sensitive confidential information from our customers. A breach of this confidentiality, whether due to a cybersecurity or other incident, could result in harm to our customers and damage to our brand.\nWe collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information in the normal course of business and may share that information with our third-party service providers. This information includes the information customers provide when purchasing a vehicle and applying for vehicle financing. We also collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential associate information in the normal course of business and may share that information with our third-party service providers. Although we have taken measures designed to safeguard such information and have received assurances from our third-party providers, our facilities and systems, and those of third-party providers, could be vulnerable to external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors or other similar events. Numerous national retailers have disclosed security breaches involving sophisticated cyber-attacks that were not recognized or detected until after such retailers had been affected, notwithstanding the preventive measures such retailers had in place. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer or associate information, whether experienced by us or by our third-party service providers, and whether due to an external cybersecurity incident, a programming error, or other cause, could damage our reputation, expose us to mitigation costs and the risks of private litigation and government enforcement, disrupt our business and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. In addition, our failure to respond quickly and appropriately to such a security breach could exacerbate the consequences of the breach.\nOur business is sensitive to changes in the prices of new and used vehicles.\nAny significant changes in retail prices for new and used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations. For example, if retail prices for used vehicles rise relative to retail prices for new vehicles, it could make buying a new vehicle more attractive to our customers than buying a used vehicle, which could have a material adverse effect on sales and results of operations and could result in decreased used margins. Manufacturer incentives could contribute to narrowing this price gap. In addition, any significant changes in wholesale prices for used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by reducing wholesale margins.\nWe may experience greater credit losses in CAF\u2019s portfolio of auto loans receivable than anticipated.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our customers who finance their purchases through CAF will be unable or unwilling to repay their loans according to their terms and that the vehicle collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to ensure full repayment. Credit losses are inherent in CAF\u2019s business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about CAF\u2019s portfolio of auto loans receivable and provide an allowance for loan losses based on a number of factors. Although management will establish an allowance for loan losses it believes is appropriate, this allowance may not be adequate. For example, when economic conditions deteriorate unexpectedly, such as in connection with the COVID-19 outbreak, additional loan losses not incorporated in the existing allowance for loan losses may occur. Losses in excess of the existing allowance for loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is dependent upon access to vehicle inventory. A failure to expeditiously liquidate that inventory-or obstacles to acquiring inventory-whether because of supply, competition, or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nUsed vehicle inventory is subject to depreciation risk. Accordingly, if we develop excess inventory, the inability to liquidate such inventory at prices that allow us to meet margin targets or to recover our costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nA reduction in the availability of, or access to, sources of inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nWe source a significant percentage of our vehicles though our appraisal process and these vehicles are generally more profitable for CarMax. Accordingly, if we fail to adjust appraisal offers to stay in line with broader market trade-in offer trends, or fail to recognize those trends, it could adversely affect our ability to acquire inventory. It could also force us to purchase a greater percentage of our inventory from third-party auctions, which is generally less profitable for CarMax. Our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process could also be affected by competition, both from new and used car dealers directly and through third parties driving appraisal traffic to those dealers. See the risk factor above titled \u201cWe operate in a highly competitive industry\u201d for discussion of this risk. Our ability to source vehicles from third-party auctions could be affected by an increase in the number of closed auctions that are open only to new car dealers who have franchise relationships with automotive manufacturers.\nWe rely on third-party finance providers to finance a significant portion of our customers\u2019 vehicle purchases. Accordingly, our sales and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these third parties.\nWe provide financing to qualified customers through CAF and a number of third-party finance providers. If one or more of these third-party providers cease to provide financing to our customers, provide financing to fewer customers or no longer provide financing on competitive terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. Additionally, if we were unable to replace the current third-party providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events, it could also have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party providers to supply EPP products to our customers. Accordingly, our sales and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these third-parties.\nWe receive revenue for selling EPP products on behalf of unrelated third-parties, who are the primary obligors. If one or more of these third-party providers cease to provide EPP products, make changes to their products or no longer provide their products on competitive terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. Additionally, if we were unable to replace the current third-party providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events, it could also have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations. Changes in these laws and regulations, or our failure to comply, could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as changes in these laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied. Our sale of used vehicles is subject to state and local licensing requirements, federal and state laws regulating vehicle advertising, and state laws regulating vehicle sales and service. Our provision of vehicle financing is subject to federal and state laws regulating the provision of consumer finance. Our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety. In addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to our business, we are also subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies and large employers generally, including privacy laws and federal employment practices, securities and tax laws. For additional discussion of these laws and regulations, see the section of this Form 10-K titled \u201cBusiness - Laws and Regulations.\u201d\nThe violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties or in a cease-and-desist order against our business operations, any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations.\nOur failure to manage our growth and the related challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nOur growth is dependent on the success of our omni-channel experience as well as on opening stores in new and existing markets and continued sales growth in our existing stores. The omni-channel rollout and the expansion of our store base places significant demands on our management team, our associates and our information systems. If we fail to effectively or efficiently manage our growth, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. Sales growth in our existing stores requires that we continue to effectively execute our business strategies and implement new and ongoing initiatives to elevate the experience of our customers. See the risk factor above titled \u201cOur failure to realize the benefits associated with our omni-channel initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations\u201d for more discussion of this risk. The expansion of our store base and implementation of new initiatives also requires us to recruit and retain the associates necessary to support that expansion. See the risk factor above titled \u201cOur success depends upon the continued contributions of our associates\u201d for discussion of this risk. The expansion of our store base also requires real estate. Our inability to acquire or lease suitable real estate at favorable terms could limit our expansion and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nSubsequent to the end of fiscal 2020, we paused our store expansion strategy and the implementation of certain of our customer experience initiatives in recognition of the potential impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on our business and financial condition. While the ultimate duration and impact of this pause is unknown, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nWe rely on sophisticated information systems to run our business. The failure of these systems, or the inability to enhance our capabilities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent upon the integrity and efficient operation of our information systems. In particular, we rely on our information systems to manage sales, inventory, our customer-facing websites and applications (carmax.com, CarMax mobile apps, and carmaxauctions.com), consumer financing and customer information. The failure of these systems to perform as designed, the failure to maintain or update these systems as necessary, or the inability to enhance our information technology capabilities, could disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nDespite our ongoing efforts to maintain and enhance the integrity and security of these systems, we could be subjected to attacks by hackers, including denial-of-service attacks directed at our websites or other system breaches or malfunctions due to associate error or misconduct or other disruptions. Such incidents could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on sales and results of operations. See the risk factor above titled \u201cWe collect sensitive confidential information from our customers\u201d for the risks associated with a breach of confidential customer or associate information.\nIn addition, COVID-19 may have an adverse impact on our information technology systems, including telecommuting issues associated with certain associates working remotely or an increase in online transactions due to disruptions or closures of our retail store operations that overburdens our existing information technology systems.\nWe rely on third-party vendors for key components of our business.\nMany components of our business, including data management, key operational processes and critical customer systems are provided by third parties. We carefully select our third-party vendors, but we do not control their actions. If our vendors fail to perform as we expect, our operations and reputation could suffer if the failure harms the vendors\u2019 ability to serve us and our customers. One or more of these third-party vendors may experience financial distress, staffing shortages or liquidity challenges, file for bankruptcy protection, go out of business, or suffer disruptions in their business due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The use of third-party vendors represents an unavoidable inherent risk to our company that could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings. If the outcomes of these proceedings are adverse to CarMax, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to various litigation matters from time to time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals, either individually or through class actions, or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings. These claims could be asserted under a variety of laws including, but not limited to, consumer finance laws, consumer protection laws, intellectual property laws, privacy laws, labor and employment laws, securities laws and employee benefit laws. These actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs, injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties including, but not limited to, suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business.\nOur business is sensitive to conditions affecting automotive manufacturers, including manufacturer recalls.\nAdverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations and could impact the supply of vehicles, including the supply of late-model used vehicles. In addition, manufacturer recalls are a common occurrence. Because we do not have manufacturer authorization to complete recall-related repairs, some vehicles we sell may have unrepaired safety recalls. Such recalls, and our lack of authorization to make recall-related repairs, could adversely affect used vehicle sales or valuations, could cause us to temporarily remove vehicles from inventory, could force us to incur increased costs and could expose us to litigation and adverse publicity related to the sale of recalled vehicles, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nOur failure to realize the benefits associated with our strategic investments could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations and we may incur impairment losses on our strategic investments in equity securities.\nFrom time to time, CarMax makes strategic investments and we currently hold non-controlling investments in the equity securities of a number of companies. For example, in January 2020, we announced that we were partnering with, and investing $50 million in Edmunds for a minority stake in the company. We may encounter difficulties in managing strategic investments and in assimilating new capabilities to meet the future needs of our business. Furthermore, we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of these investments, or the realized benefits may be significantly delayed. While our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business, legal, and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential benefits and risks of a particular investment.\nAdditionally, under GAAP, if any investment\u2019s fair value declines below its carrying value, we will need to record an impairment loss in the applicable fiscal period. As a result, we may incur expenses related to the impairment of existing or future equity investments. Any such impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations and financial condition are subject to management\u2019s accounting judgments and estimates, as well as changes in accounting policies.\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of CarMax\u2019s assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and earnings. If these estimates or assumptions are incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We have identified several accounting policies as being \u201ccritical\u201d to the fair presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve major aspects of our business and require us to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. These policies are described in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe implementation of new accounting requirements or other changes to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation.\nThe price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon our operating results, general economic and market conditions, general trends and prospects for our industry, announcements by our competitors and other factors. In addition, the market price of our common stock may also be affected by whether we meet analysts\u2019 expectations. Failure to meet such expectations could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation may be initiated. If similar litigation were instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could adversely affect our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nProtecting our intellectual property (including patents, trademarks, copyrights, confidential information and trade secrets) is integral to our business. The failure to protect our intellectual property, including from unauthorized uses, can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is sensitive to weather events.\nThe occurrence of severe weather events, such as rain, hail, snow, wind, storms, hurricanes, extended periods of unusually cold weather or natural disasters, could cause store closures or affect the timing of consumer demand, either of which could adversely affect consumer traffic and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations in a given period.\nWe are subject to local conditions in the geographic areas in which we are concentrated.\nOur performance is subject to local economic, competitive and other conditions prevailing in geographic areas where we operate. Since a large portion of our sales is generated in the Southeastern U.S., California, Texas and Washington, D.C./Baltimore, our results of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in these markets. In\nthe event that any of these geographic areas experience a downturn in economic conditions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 89508, "SIC": 5500, "TIC": "KMX"}
