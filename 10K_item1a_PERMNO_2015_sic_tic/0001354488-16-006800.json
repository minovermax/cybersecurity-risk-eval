In addition to the other information in this Annual Report and our other filings with the SEC, you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not specified herein, not currently known to us, or currently deemed to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows.\nAny one of these factors or a combination of these factors could materially affect our future results of operations and could influence whether any forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update these statements unless we are required to do so.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe dangers inherent in oil and gas operations could expose us to potentially significant losses, costs or liabilities and reduce our liquidity.\nOil and gas operations are inherently subject to significant hazards and risks. These hazards and risks include, but are not limited to, fires, explosions, ruptures, blowouts, spills, third-party interference and equipment failure, any of which could result in interruption or termination of operations, pollution, personal injury and death, or damage to our assets and the property of others. These risks could harm our reputation and business, result in claims against us, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe geographic concentration of our assets creates a significant exposure to the risks of the regional economy and other regional adverse conditions.\nOur primary operating asset, the Nixon Facility, is located in Nixon, Texas in the Eagle Ford Shale and we market our refined petroleum products in a single, relatively limited geographic area. In addition, our onshore facilities assets are located in Freeport, Texas, and all of our pipelines, offshore facilities and oil and gas properties are located within the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, our operations are more susceptible to regional economic conditions than our more geographically diversified competitors. Any changes in market conditions, unforeseen circumstances or other events affecting the area in which our assets are located could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These factors include, among other things, changes in the economy, weather conditions, demographics, and population.\nBLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY\n2015 FORM 10-K\nCompetition from companies having greater financial and other resources could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe refining industry is highly competitive. Our refining operations compete with domestic refiners and marketers in PADD 3 (Gulf Coast), domestic refiners in other PADD regions, and foreign refiners that import products into the U.S. Certain of our competitors have larger, more complex refineries and may be able to realize higher margins per barrel of production. Several of our principal competitors are integrated national or international oil companies that are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do and have access to proprietary sources of controlled crude oil production. Unlike these competitors, we obtain all of our feedstocks from a single supplier. Because of their integrated operations and larger capitalization, larger, more complex refineries may be more flexible in responding to volatile industry or market conditions, such as crude oil and other feedstocks supply shortages or commodity price fluctuations. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose existing customers or fail to acquire new customers.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to remain in compliance or to remediate current or future contamination that could give rise to material liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the emission or discharge of pollutants into the environment, product specifications and the generation, treatment, storage, transportation, disposal and remediation of solid and hazardous wastes. Violations of these laws and regulations or permit conditions can result in substantial penalties, injunctive orders compelling installation of additional controls, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns.\nIn addition, new environmental laws and regulations, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, increased governmental enforcement of laws and regulations or other developments could require us to make additional unforeseen expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. The requirements to be met, as well as the technology and length of time available to meet those requirements, continue to develop and change. These expenditures or costs for environmental compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and profitability.\nThe Nixon Facility operates under a number of federal and state permits, licenses and approvals with terms and conditions containing a significant number of prescriptive limits and performance standards in order to operate. All of these permits, licenses, approvals, limits and standards require a significant amount of monitoring, record keeping and reporting in order to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit, license, approval, limit or standard. Non-compliance or incomplete documentation of our compliance status may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive relief. Additionally, due to the nature of our refining processes, there may be times when we are unable to meet the standards and terms and conditions of our permits, licenses and approvals due to operational upsets or malfunctions, which may lead to the imposition of fines and penalties or operating restrictions that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our facilities, and accordingly our financial performance.\nWe are subject to strict laws and regulations regarding personnel and process safety, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and profitability.\nWe are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers, and the proper design, operation and maintenance of our equipment. In addition, OSHA and certain environmental regulations require that we maintain information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that we provide this information to personnel and state and local governmental authorities. Failure to comply with these requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring and control of occupational exposure to regulated substances, may result in significant fines or compliance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nBLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY\n2015 FORM 10-K\nOur insurance policies may be inadequate or expensive.\nOur insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses, costs or liabilities. We could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of our existing insurance coverage. Our ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which we have no control. In addition, if we experience insurable events, we may experience an increase in annual premiums, a limit on coverage, or loss of coverage. Inadequate insurance or loss of coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLEH holds a significant interest in us, and our related party transactions with LEH and its affiliates may cause conflicts of interest that may adversely affect us.\nJonathan P. Carroll, our Chief Executive Officer, President, Assistant Treasurer and Secretary, is also a majority owner of LEH. LEH owns approximately 81% of our Common Stock, and, pursuant to the Operating Agreement, manages and operates all of our properties. LEH and Mr. Carroll have significant influence over matters such as the election of our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), control over our business, policies and affairs and other matters submitted to our stockholders. LEH and Mr. Carroll are entitled to vote the Common Stock owned by LEH in accordance with its interests, which may be contrary to the interests of other stockholders. LEH has interests that may differ from the interests of other stockholders and, as a result, there is a risk that important business decisions will not be made in the best interest of some of our stockholders.\nLEH and its affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us and are not obligated to offer us business opportunities. We believe that the transactions and agreements that we have entered into with LEH and its affiliates are on terms that are at least as favorable as could reasonably have been obtained at such time from third-parties. However, these relationships could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our Board is faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and LEH or its affiliates. The appearance of conflicts, even if such conflicts do not materialize, might adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of us, as well as our relationship with other companies and our ability to enter into new relationships in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business.\nWe may have capital needs for which our internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity may not be adequate.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise secure sufficient liquidity to support our short-term and long-term capital requirements, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations or pursue our business strategies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity. Our short-term working capital needs are primarily related to repayment of debt obligations and capital expenditures for maintenance, upgrades, and refurbishment of equipment at the Nixon Facility. Our long-term working capital needs are primarily related to repayment of long-term debt obligations. In addition, we continue to utilize capital to reduce operational, safety and environmental risks. We may incur substantial compliance costs in connection with any new environmental, health and safety regulations. Our liquidity will affect our ability to satisfy any of these needs.\nOur ability to use net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cIRC Section 382\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income. Within the meaning of IRC Section 382, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs when the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% shareholders, applying certain look-through rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders' lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years).\nAs of December 31, 2015, we reported a net deferred tax asset of approximately $3.6 million. Blue Dolphin experienced ownership changes in 2005 in connection with a series of private placements, and in 2012 as a result of a reverse acquisition. The 2012 ownership change limits our ability to utilize NOLs following the 2005 ownership change that were not previously subject to limitation. Limitations imposed on our ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income could cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect, and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. NOLs generated after the 2012 ownership change are not subject to limitation.\nBLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY\n2015 FORM 10-K\nTerrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, threats of war, or actual war may negatively affect our operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nEnergy-related assets in the U.S. may be at a greater risk for future terrorist attacks than other potential targets. A direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, any terrorist attack in the U.S. could have an adverse impact on energy prices, including prices for crude oil and refined petroleum products, and refining margins. Disruption or significant increases in energy prices could result in government imposed price controls. While we currently maintain some insurance that provides coverage against terrorist attacks, such insurance has become increasingly expensive and difficult to obtain. As a result, insurance providers may not continue to offer this coverage to us on terms that we consider affordable, or at all.\nOur operations are dependent on our technology infrastructure, which includes a data network, telecommunications system, internet access, and various computer hardware equipment and software applications. Our technology infrastructure is subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources, including natural disasters, software viruses or other malware, power failures, cyber-attacks, and/or other events. To the extent that our technology infrastructure is under our control, we have implemented measures such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes to address identified risks. However, there can be no assurance that a security breach or cyber-attack will not compromise confidential, business critical information, cause a disruption in our operations, or harm our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Refining Operations\nRefining margins are volatile, and a reduction in refining margins will adversely affect the amount of cash we will have available for working capital.\nHistorically, refining margins have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship, or margin, between our refined petroleum product sales prices and our crude oil and condensate costs. Our crude oil and condensate acquisition costs and the prices at which we can ultimately sell our refined petroleum products depend upon numerous factors beyond our control.\nThe prices at which we sell refined petroleum products are strongly influenced by the commodity price of crude oil. If crude oil prices increase, our \u201crefinery operations\u201d business segment margins will fall unless we are able to pass along these price increases to our wholesale customers. Increases in the selling prices for refined petroleum products typically lag behind the rising cost of crude oil and may be difficult to implement when crude oil costs increase dramatically over a short period of time.\nThe price volatility of crude oil, other feedstocks, refined petroleum products, and fuel and utility services may have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur refining earnings, cash flows and liquidity from operations depend primarily on the margin above operating expenses (including the cost of refinery feedstocks, such as crude oil and condensate that are processed and blended into refined petroleum products) at which we are able to sell refined petroleum products. Crude oil refining is primarily a margin-based business. In order to improve margins, it is important for a crude oil refinery to maximize the yields of high value finished petroleum produces and to minimize the costs of feedstocks and operating expenses. When the margin between refined petroleum product prices and crude oil and other feedstock costs decreases, our margins are negatively affected. Crude oil refining margins have historically been volatile, and are likely to continue to be volatile, as a result of a variety of factors, including fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, other feedstocks, refined petroleum products, and fuel and utility services. While an increase or decrease in the price of crude oil may result in a similar increase or decrease in prices for refined petroleum products, there may be a time lag in the realization of the similar increase or decrease in prices for refined petroleum products. The effect of changes in crude oil and condensate prices on our refining margins therefore depends, in part, on how quickly and how fully refined petroleum product prices adjust to reflect these changes.\nBLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY\n2015 FORM 10-K\nPrices of crude oil, other feedstocks and refined petroleum products depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, other feedstocks, and refined petroleum products. Such supply and demand are affected by, among other things:\n\u25cf\nchanges in foreign, domestic, and local economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nforeign and domestic demand for fuel products;\n\u25cf\nworldwide political conditions, particularly in significant oil producing regions;\n\u25cf\nforeign and domestic production levels of crude oil, other feedstocks, and refined petroleum products and the volume of crude oil, feedstocks, and refined petroleum products imported into the U.S.;\n\u25cf\navailability of and access to transportation infrastructure;\n\u25cf\ncapacity utilization rates of refineries in the U.S.;\n\u25cf\nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries\u2019 influence on oil prices;\n\u25cf\ndevelopment and marketing of alternative and competing fuels;\n\u25cf\ncommodities speculation;\n\u25cf\nnatural disasters (such as hurricanes and tornadoes), accidents, interruptions in transportation, inclement weather or other events that can cause unscheduled shutdowns or otherwise adversely affect our refineries;\n\u25cf\nfederal and state governmental regulations and taxes; and\n\u25cf\nlocal factors, including market conditions, weather conditions and the level of operations of other refineries and pipelines in our markets.\nPotential downtime at the Nixon Facility could result in lost margin opportunity, increased maintenance expense, increased inventory, and a reduction in cash available for payment of our obligations.\nThe safe and reliable operation of the Nixon Facility is key to our financial performance and results of operations, and we are particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our operations because all of our refining operations are conducted at a single facility. Although currently operating at anticipated levels, the Nixon Facility is still in a recommissioning phase and may require unscheduled downtime for unanticipated reasons, including maintenance and repairs, voluntary regulatory compliance measures, or cessation or suspension by regulatory authorities. Occasionally, the Nixon Facility experiences a temporary shutdown due to power outages as a result of high winds and thunderstorms. In the case of such a shutdown, the refinery must initiate a standard start-up process, and such process can last several days although we are typically able to resume normal operations the next day. Any scheduled or unscheduled downtime may result in lost margin opportunity, increased maintenance expense and a build-up of refined petroleum products inventory, which could reduce our ability to meet our payment obligations.\nLoss of market share by a key customer or consolidation among our customer base that could harm our operating results.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, 56% of our refined petroleum products sales came from three customers. These customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us, including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms, which often results in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier. Our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance. Our operating results could be harmed if a key customer is lost, reduces their order quantity, requires us to reduce our prices, is acquired by a competitor, or suffers financial hardship.\nBLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY\n2015 FORM 10-K\nAdditionally, our profitability could be adversely affected if there is consolidation among our customer base and our customers command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale. We could decide not to sell our refined petroleum products to a particular customer if, as a result of increased leverage, the customer pressures us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished, which could result in a decrease in our revenue. Consolidation may also lead to reduced demand for our products, replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors, and cancellations of orders, each of which could harm our operating results.\nThe sale of refined petroleum products to the wholesale market is our primary business, and if we fail to maintain and grow the market share of our refined petroleum products, our operating results could suffer.\nOur success in the wholesale market depends in large part on our ability to maintain and grow our image and reputation as a reliable operator and to expand into and gain market acceptance of our refined petroleum products. Adverse perceptions of product quality, whether or not justified, or allegations of product quality issues, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish our reputation and cause our wholesale customers to choose refined petroleum products offered by our competitors.\nWe are dependent on third-parties for the transportation of crude oil and condensate into and refined petroleum products out of our Nixon Facility, and if these third-parties become unavailable to us, our ability to process crude oil and condensate and sell refined petroleum products to wholesale markets could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on trucks for the receipt of crude oil and condensate into and the sale of refined petroleum products out of our Nixon Facility. Since we do not own or operate any of these trucks, their continuing operation is not within our control. If any of the third-party trucking companies that we use, or the trucking industry in general, become unavailable to transport crude oil, condensate, and/or our refined petroleum products because of acts of God, accidents, government regulation, terrorism or other events, our revenue and net income would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur supplier sources a substantial amount, if not all, of our crude oil and condensate from the Eagle Ford Shale and may experience interruptions of supply from that region.\nOur supplier sources a substantial amount, if not all, of our crude oil and condensate from the Eagle Ford Shale. As a result, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of supply from that region caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, unavailability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of oil or natural gas produced from the wells in that area.\nOur refining operations and customers are primarily located within the Eagle Ford Shale and changes in the supply/demand balance in this region could result in lower refining margins.\nOur primary operating asset, the Nixon Facility, is located in the Eagle Ford Shale and we market our refined petroleum products in a single, relatively limited geographic area. As a result, we are more susceptible to regional economic conditions than our more geographically diversified competitors. Should the supply/demand balance shift in our region as a result of changes in the local economy, an increase in refining capacity or other reasons, resulting in supply in the PADD 3 (Gulf Coast) region to exceed demand, we would have to deliver refined petroleum products to customers outside of our current operating region and thus incur considerably higher transportation costs, resulting in lower refining margins.\nHedging of our refined petroleum products and crude oil and condensate may limit our gains and expose us to other risks.\nWe are exposed to commodity price risk related to our refined petroleum products and crude oil and condensate inventories. The spread between the cost of crude oil and condensate and refined petroleum product sales prices is the primary factor affecting our operations, liquidity and financial condition. Our feedstock acquisition costs and refined petroleum products sales prices depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the supply of and demand for crude oil, gasoline, and refined petroleum products. Supply and demand for these products depend on various factors, including changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, availability of imports and exports, marketing of competitive fuels, and government regulation.\nBLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY\n2015 FORM 10-K\nUnder our inventory risk management policy, Genesis may, but is not required to, use derivative instruments as certain of our refined petroleum product inventories exceed certain thresholds in an effort to reduce our commodity price risk. However, Genesis\u2019 execution of the inventory risk management plan is outside of our control. Accordingly, there could be situations in which Genesis fails to execute on the plan or executes on the plan in a manner that causes significant losses to us, all of which are beyond our control. In the event that our inventory risk management system fails and/or is implemented poorly or not at all, we could experience a material and negative adverse effect on our operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur operations are highly dependent on our relationships with Genesis, and, if we are unable to successfully maintain these relationships, our operations, liquidity and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe are party to a variety of contracts and agreements with Genesis and its affiliates that enable the purchase of crude oil and condensate, transportation of crude oil and condensate, and other services. Certain of these agreements with Genesis and its affiliates have successive one-year renewals until August 2019 unless sooner terminated by Genesis or its affiliates with 180 days prior written notice. These agreements and understandings require us to have a close working relationship with Genesis in order for us to be successful in fully executing our business strategy. If we are unable to maintain these relationships or our relationships are not on good terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe have an understanding with Genesis related to inventory risk management, which is intended to reduce the commodity price risk of our refined petroleum product inventories and generate a more consistent gross profit margin for each barrel of refined petroleum products. We also purchase 100% of our crude oil and other feedstocks exclusively from a Genesis affiliate. We have the ability to purchase crude oil and condensate from other suppliers with the prior consent of the Genesis affiliate. To the extent that the volume of crude oil and other feedstocks that are supplied to us are reduced as a result of declining production, competition, or otherwise, our sales, net income and cash available for payments of our debt obligations would decline unless we were able to acquire comparable supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks on comparable terms from other suppliers. Further, a material decrease in either crude oil and condensate production or drilling activity in the fields that supply the Nixon Facility, as a result of depressed commodity prices, natural production declines, governmental moratoriums on drilling or production activities, the availability and the cost of capital or otherwise, could result in a decline in the volume of crude oil and condensate that we refine.\nOur business may suffer if any of the executive officers or other key personnel discontinues employment with us. Furthermore, a shortage of skilled labor or disruptions in our labor force may make it difficult for us to maintain productivity.\nOur future success depends to a large extent on the services of the executive officers and other key personnel and on our continuing ability to recruit, train and retain highly qualified personnel in all areas of our operations. Furthermore, our operations require skilled and experienced personnel with proficiency in multiple tasks. Competition for skilled personnel with industry-specific experience is intense, and the loss of these executives or personnel could harm our business. If any of these executives or other key personnel resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nLEH may, but is not required to, fund our working capital requirements in the event our internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity are inadequate.\nHistorically, we relied on LEH to fund working capital requirements when cash reserves and revenue from operations, including sales of refined petroleum products and rental of petroleum storage tanks, were insufficient to fund our working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, working capital requirements funded by LEH were $0 and $1,174,168, respectively, and are reflected in accounts payable, related party in our consolidated balance sheets. In the event our working capital requirements are inadequate, or we are otherwise unable to secure sufficient liquidity to support our short term and/or long-term capital requirements, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations, comply with certain deadlines related to environmental regulations and standards or pursue our business strategies, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity. Our long-term needs for cash include ongoing capital expenditures for equipment to improve the Nixon Facility and reduce operational, safety and environmental risks. Our liquidity will affect our ability to satisfy any of these needs.\nBLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY\n2015 FORM 10-K\nRegulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase our operational costs and reduce demand for our products.\nContinued political focus on climate change, human activities contributing to the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on our operations and financial results. International agreements and federal, state and local regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions are currently in various stages of discussion and implementation. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies, and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating, and maintenance costs. The level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, our activities in the particular jurisdiction, and market conditions. The effect of regulation on our financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, among others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which we would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations, our ability to acquire compliance related equipment, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and our ability to recover incurred regulatory compliance costs through the pricing of our products. Material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could also reduce demand for products we currently sell and adversely affect our sales volumes, revenues and margins.\nRisks Related to Our Pipelines and Oil and Gas Properties\nRequests by the BOEM to increase bonds or other sureties in order to maintain compliance with the BOEM\u2019s regulations could significantly impact our liquidity and financial condition.\nIn order to cover the various obligations of lessees on the Outer Continental Shelf, such as the cost to plug and abandon wells and decommission and remove platforms and pipelines at the end of production, the BOEM generally requires that lessees demonstrate financial strength and reliability according to regulations or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be satisfied, unless the BOEM exempts the lessee from such financial assurance requirements. In August 2014, the BOEM issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in which the agency indicated that it was considering changing the financial assurance requirements, and it currently plans to publish a revised notice to lessees in 2016. Part of the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking includes the BOEM revising its supplemental bonding procedures by shifting from the current \u201cwaiver\u201d model for self-insurance to a credit based model. The cost of these bonds or assurances can be substantial, and there is no assurance that they can be obtained in all cases.\nIn August 2015, we received notice from the BOEM requesting additional supplemental bonds or acceptable financial assurance of approximately $4.2 million for existing pipeline rights-of-way. We are currently working with the BOEM to develop a tailored plan to address the financial assurance requirements. There can be no assurance that the BOEM will accept a reduced amount of supplemental financial assurance or not require additional supplemental pipeline bonds related to our existing pipeline rights-of-way.\nAt December 31, 2015, we maintained approximately $0.9 million in credit and cash-backed rights-of-way bonds issued to the BOEM. At December 31, 2014, we maintained approximately $1.6 million in credit and cash-backed rights-of-way bonds issued to the BOEM. In December 2014, we completed work to abandon-in-place the pipeline associated with Right-of-Way Number OCS-G 08606. As a result, in November 2015, the BOEM released approximately $0.7 million in cash collateral backing this supplemental pipeline bond.\nMore stringent requirements imposed by the BOEM and the BSEE related to the decommissioning, plugging, and abandonment of wells, platforms, and pipelines could materially increase our estimate of future AROs.\nIn October 2010, the BOEM issued a notice to lessees that establishes a more stringent regimen for the timely decommissioning of what is known as \u201cidle iron\u201d - wells, platforms, and pipelines that are no longer producing or serving exploration or support functions related to an operator\u2019s lease. The notice to lessees sets forth more stringent standards for decommissioning timing by requiring that any well that has not been used during the past five years for exploration or production on active leases and is no longer capable of producing in paying quantities must be permanently plugged or temporarily abandoned within three years. Plugging or abandonment of wells may be delayed by two years if all of the well\u2019s hydrocarbon and sulfur zones are appropriately isolated. Similarly, platforms or other facilities which are no longer useful for operations must be removed within five years of the cessation of operations. The triggering of these plugging, abandonment, and removal activities under what may be viewed as an accelerated schedule in comparison to historical decommissioning efforts could cause an increase, perhaps materially, in our future plugging, abandonment, and removal costs, which may translate into a need to increase our estimate of future AROs. Although management has used its best efforts to determine future AROs, assumptions and estimates can be influenced by many factors beyond management\u2019s control. Such factors, include, but are not limited to, changes in regulatory requirements, changes in costs for abandonment related services and technologies, which could increase or decrease based on supply and demand, and/or extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, which may cause structural or other damage to pipeline and related assets and oil and gas properties. As of December 31, 2015, our estimated future asset retirement obligations were approximately $2.0 million. See \u201cPart II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note (11) Asset Retirement Obligations\u201d of this Annual Report for additional information regarding asset retirement obligations.\nBLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY\n2015 FORM 10-K", "PERMNO": 76310, "SIC": 4922, "TIC": "BDCO"}
