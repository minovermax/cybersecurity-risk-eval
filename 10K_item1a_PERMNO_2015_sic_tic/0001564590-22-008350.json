{"cik": "1069308", "company": "Acer Therapeutics Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider the following risk factors, as well as other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report, before deciding to invest in our securities. The following factors affect our business, our intellectual property, the industry in which we operate and our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or which we consider immaterial as of the date hereof may also have an adverse effect on our business. If any of the matters discussed in the following risk factors were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected, the market price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Financial Condition\nWe will require additional financing to complete development and seek to obtain marketing approval of our product candidates other than ACER-001 and, if approved, to commercialize our product candidates, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development, other operations or commercialization efforts.\nSince our inception, substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to the clinical development of our product candidates. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $114.5 million, cash and cash equivalents of $12.7 million and current liabilities of $29.1 million, which include $15.8 million associated with deferred collaboration funding, as well as a $9.3 million liability related to the securities class action and stockholder derivative actions settlements and legal costs, for which we have also recorded an asset of an equal amount representing the recovery from our insurance carriers. As discussed above, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents available at December 31, 2021, plus the $5.0 million second tranche of the Second Development Payment received on January 14, 2022 per the Collaboration Agreement with Relief, will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating and capital requirements into mid-2022, excluding support for planned ACER-001 (MSUD), ACER-801 and EDSIVOTM clinical trials. There is no guarantee that ACER-001 will receive regulatory authority approval in any territory or become commercially available for the indications under investigation.\nWe will need to raise additional capital in order to finance the completion of clinical development and regulatory preparedness of our product candidates, preparations for a commercial launch of our product candidates, if approved, and development of any other current or future product candidates we may choose to further develop. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, obtaining marketing approvals, and manufacturing and supply as well as marketing and selling any products approved for sale. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. Because the outcome of any drug development process is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our current product candidates, if approved, or future product candidates, if any.\nOur operating plan may change as a result of factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek substantial additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as non-dilutive funding or strategic collaborations. Such financing may result in dilution to stockholders, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, results, and costs of researching and developing our current product candidates, and future product candidates, if any, including conducting preclinical and clinical trials\n\u2022\nthe cost of seeking regulatory and marketing approvals and reimbursement for our product candidates and future product candidates, if any\n\u2022\nthe cost of commercialization activities if our current product candidates and future product candidates, if any, are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs, and preparedness of our corporate infrastructure\n\u2022\nthe cost of manufacturing current product candidates and future product candidates, if any, that we obtain approval for and successfully commercialize\n\u2022\nthe timing, receipt, and amount of payments we may receive from Relief under the Collaboration Agreement\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements\n\u2022\nthe number and characteristics of any additional product candidates we may develop or acquire\n\u2022\nany product liability or other lawsuits related to our product candidates or commenced against us\n\u2022\nthe expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with being a public company\n\u2022\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending, and enforcing our intellectual property rights, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation\n\u2022\nthe timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, future approved product candidates, if any\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to:\n\u2022\ndelay, limit, reduce or terminate preclinical studies, clinical trials or other development activities for our current product candidates or future product candidates, if any\n\u2022\ndelay, limit, reduce or terminate our research and development activities\n\u2022\ndelay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize future approved product candidates, if any\nSubstantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $114.5 million, cash and cash equivalents of $12.7 million, and current liabilities of $29.1 million, which include $15.8 million associated with deferred collaboration funding, as well as a $9.3 million liability related to the securities class action and stockholder derivative actions settlements and legal cost, for which we have also recorded an asset of an equal amount representing the recovery from our insurance carriers. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents available at December 31, 2021, plus the $5.0 million second tranche of the Second Development Payment received on January 14, 2022 per the Collaboration Agreement with Relief, will be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated operating and capital requirements into mid-2022, excluding support for planned ACER-001 (MSUD), ACER-801 and EDSIVOTM clinical trials. There is no guarantee that ACER-001 will receive regulatory authority approval in any territory or become commercially available for the indications under investigation. We will continue to require substantial capital to continue our clinical development and pursuit of regulatory approval activities. Accordingly, we will need to raise substantial additional capital to continue to fund our operations. Moreover, we have not established a source of product sales and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our development of, and seek marketing approvals for, our product candidates. These factors individually and collectively raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and therefore it may be more difficult for us to attract investors. Unless we are able to raise additional capital to finance our operations, our long-term business plan may not be accomplished, and we may be forced to cease, reduce, or delay operations, including reduction of employees recently hired in order to prepare for possible launch and marketing of ACER-001.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that resulted in a restatement of our unaudited condensed interim financial statements for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021. This material weakness, if not remediated, could again adversely affect our ability to report our results of operations and financial condition accurately and in a timely manner.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our management is likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses identified through such evaluation in those internal controls. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs described elsewhere in this report, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the accounting and reporting for the Collaboration Agreement entered into with Relief. As a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021, September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2021.\nTo respond to this material weakness, we have devoted, and plan to continue to devote, significant effort and resources to the remediation and improvement of our internal control over financial reporting. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can provide no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. For a discussion of management\u2019s consideration of the material weakness identified with respect to our accounting and reporting for the Relief transaction, see Part II, Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d included in this report.\nAny failure to remediate our existing or any future material weaknesses or otherwise maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to report our financial position and results of operations on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations and may lose confidence in our financial reporting and our business, reputation, results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, stock price and ability to access the capital markets could be adversely affected. In addition, we may be unable to maintain or regain compliance with applicable securities laws, stock market listing requirements and covenants regarding the timely filing of periodic reports, we may be subject to regulatory investigations and penalties, and we may face claims invoking the federal and state securities laws. Any such litigation or dispute, whether successful or not, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe can provide no assurance that the measures we have taken and plan to take in the future will remediate the material weakness identified or that any additional material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls. In addition, even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures, in the future these controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our financial statements.\nWe entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Relief which allows them to control the development and commercialization of ACER-001 in UCDs and MSUD in territories other than the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Turkey, and Japan, which may impact our ability to generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability. In addition, we are required to provide assistance to Relief in the performance of their contractual obligations, which may distract us from achieving our objectives.\nOn March 19, 2021, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Relief providing for the development and commercialization of ACER-001 for the treatment of various inborn errors of metabolism, including for the treatment of UCDs and MSUD. The Collaboration Agreement is the culmination of the Option Agreement previously entered into between Acer and Relief on January 25, 2021 which provided Relief with an exclusive period of time up to June 30, 2021 for the parties to enter into a mutually acceptable definitive agreement with respect to the potential collaboration and license arrangements in return for a $1.0 million exclusivity fee. Upon\nsigning the Collaboration Agreement, we received a $10.0 million cash payment from Relief ($14.0 million, offset by repayment of the $4.0 million outstanding balance of the prior loan, plus interest, from Relief to Acer). Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Relief committed to pay us up to $20.0 million for U.S. development and commercial launch costs for the UCDs and MSUD indications. During the three months ended June 30, 2021, we received from Relief the $10.0 million First Development Payment. We were contractually entitled to receive from Relief an additional $10.0 million Second Development Payment conditioned upon FDA\u2019s acceptance of an NDA for ACER-001 in a UCD for filing and review. This acceptance was received on October 4, 2021. On October 6, we entered into a Waiver and Agreement with Relief to amend the timing for the Second Development Payment. We received the Second Development Payment in two $5.0 million tranches on each of October 12, 2021 and January 14, 2022. Further, we retained development and commercialization rights in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Turkey and Japan. The companies will split net profits from Acer\u2019s territories 60%:40% in favor of Relief. Relief licensed the rights for the rest of the world, where we will receive from Relief a 15% royalty on all net sales received by Relief in Relief\u2019s territories. We could also receive a total of $6.0 million in milestone payments based on the first European (\u201cEU\u201d) marketing approvals of ACER-001 for a UCD and MSUD. There is no guarantee that ACER-001 will receive regulatory authority approval in any territory or become commercially available for the indications under investigation.\nThe rights we have relinquished to our product candidate ACER-001 in the applicable territories, including development and commercialization rights, may impact our ability to generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability. We are reliant on Relief\u2019s resources and efforts with respect to ACER-001 in UCDs and MSUD in their applicable territories, including the pace at which Relief moves forward with development and commercialization. Relief may fail to develop or successfully commercialize ACER-001 for a variety of reasons, including that Relief:\n\u2022\ndoes not have sufficient resources or decides not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints such as limited cash or human resources\n\u2022\ndecides to pursue a competitive potential product\n\u2022\ncannot obtain the necessary regulatory approvals\n\u2022\ndetermines that the market opportunity is not attractive, or\n\u2022\ncannot manufacture or obtain the necessary materials in sufficient quantities from multiple sources or at a reasonable cost\nIn addition, we are required by our agreements with Relief to provide certain assistance in the performance of their obligations. Doing so may cause us to delay or defer achievement of our own objectives regarding ACER-001 or our other programs.\nIf Relief does not pursue development and successfully commercialize ACER-001 in the applicable territories, our ability to generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability could be significantly hindered and may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFunding from our equity line purchase agreement with Lincoln Park may be limited or be insufficient to fund our operations or implement our strategy.\nUnder our equity line purchase agreement with Lincoln Park, we may direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to $15.0 million of shares of our common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions, over a 36-month period commencing on June 8, 2020, with $12.1 million obligation remaining as of December 31, 2021. There can be no assurance that we will be able to receive all of the remaining committed funds from Lincoln Park because the purchase agreement contains limitations, restrictions, requirements, events of default and other provisions that could limit our ability to cause Lincoln Park to buy common stock from us, including that Lincoln Park own no more than 9.99% of our common stock. In addition, under the applicable rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market, if we seek to issue shares in excess of 19.99% of the total common stock outstanding as of the date we entered into the purchase agreement, we may be required to seek stockholder approval in order to be in compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market rules. Our inability to access a portion or the full amount remaining available under the purchase agreement,\nin the absence of any other financing sources, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Subsequent to signing the purchase agreement and through the date of this report, we have sold an aggregate of 1,100,000 shares of common stock under the purchase agreement for net proceeds of $2.6 million.\nThe extent to which we rely on Lincoln Park as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors, including the amount of working capital needed, the prevailing market price of our common stock and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources. We may also need to file one or more additional registration statements to register shares for resale under the terms of the purchase agreement and keep current an offering prospectus. If obtaining sufficient funding from Lincoln Park were to prove unavailable or prohibitively dilutive, we would need to secure another source of funding in order to satisfy our working capital needs. Even if we were to receive all $15.0 million in proceeds under the purchase agreement with Lincoln Park, we may still need additional capital to fully implement our business, operating and development plans. Should the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, the consequences could be a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nFunding from our at-the-market (\u201cATM\u201d) facility with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC (\u201cJonesTrading\u201d) and Roth Capital Partners, LLC (\u201cRoth Capital\u201d) may be limited or may be insufficient to fund our operations or to implement our strategy.\nWe will need to keep current our shelf registration statement and an offering prospectus relating to our ATM facility with JonesTrading and Roth Capital in order to use the program to sell shares of our common stock, as well as provide certain periodic deliverables required by the amended and restated sales agreement with JonesTrading and Roth Capital for the ATM facility. Due to the SEC\u2019s \u201cbaby shelf rules,\u201d which prohibit companies with a public float of less than $75 million from issuing securities under a shelf registration statement in excess of one-third of such company\u2019s public float in a 12-month period, we are only able to issue a limited number of shares which aggregate to no more than one-third of our public float using our shelf registration statement at this time. The number of shares and price at which we may be able to sell shares under the ATM facility may be limited due to market conditions and other factors beyond our control.\nWe have a limited operating history and have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability. The absence of any commercial sales and our limited operating history make it difficult to assess our future viability.\nWe are a development-stage pharmaceutical company with a limited operating history and a history of losses. Pharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We are focused principally on repurposing and/or reformulating existing drugs for serious rare and life-threatening diseases with significant unmet medical needs. We are not profitable and have incurred losses in each year since inception. We have only a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. In addition, we have limited experience and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry. We have not generated any product sales revenue to date. We continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. Our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $15.4 million and $22.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $114.5 million. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our development of, and seek marketing approvals for, our product candidates.\nWe have devoted substantially all of our financial resources to identify, acquire, and develop our product candidates, including providing general and administrative support for our operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of our future expenditures and our ability to obtain funding through public or private equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations, or non-dilutive funding. We expect losses to increase as we conduct clinical trials and continue to develop our product candidates. We expect to invest significant funds into the research and development of our current product candidates to determine the potential to advance these product candidates to\nregulatory approval. We may also invest in acquiring or in-licensing additional product candidates to expand our pipeline.\nIf we obtain regulatory approval to market a product candidate, our future revenue will depend upon the size of any markets in which our product candidates may receive approval and our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, pricing, reimbursement from third-party payors, and adequate market share for our product candidates in those markets. Even if we obtain adequate market share for our product candidates, because the potential markets in which our product candidates may ultimately receive regulatory approval could be very small, we may never become profitable despite obtaining such market share and acceptance of our products.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future, and our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\n\u2022\nseek regulatory and marketing approvals and reimbursement for our product candidates\n\u2022\ncontinue the clinical development of our product candidates\n\u2022\ncontinue efforts to discover new product candidates\n\u2022\nundertake the manufacturing of our product candidates or increase volumes manufactured by third parties\n\u2022\nadvance our programs into larger, more expensive clinical trials\n\u2022\ninitiate additional preclinical, clinical, or other trials or studies for our product candidates\n\u2022\nestablish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval and market for ourselves\n\u2022\nseek to identify, assess, acquire and/or develop other product candidates\n\u2022\nmake milestone, royalty or other payments under third-party license agreements\n\u2022\nseek to maintain, protect and expand our intellectual property portfolio\n\u2022\nseek to attract and retain skilled personnel\n\u2022\nexperience any delays or encounter issues with the development and potential for regulatory approval of our clinical candidates such as safety issues, clinical trial enrollment delays, longer follow-up for planned studies, additional major studies or supportive studies necessary to support marketing approval\nFurther, the net losses we incur will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance.\nWe currently have no source of product sales revenue and may never be profitable.\nWhile we have generated revenue related to the Collaboration Agreement with Relief, we have not generated any revenues from commercial sales of any of our current product candidates. Our ability to generate product revenue depends upon our ability to successfully identify, develop and commercialize these product candidates or other product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire in the future. Our ability to generate future product revenue from our current or future product candidates also depends on a number of additional factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully complete research and clinical development of current and future product candidates\n\u2022\nestablish and maintain supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties, and ensure adequate and legally compliant manufacturing of product candidates\n\u2022\nobtain regulatory approval from relevant regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where we intend to market our product candidates\n\u2022\nlaunch and commercialize future product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, if any, and if launched independently, successfully establish a sales force and medical affairs, marketing and distribution infrastructure\n\u2022\nobtain coverage and adequate product reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors\n\u2022\nachieve market acceptance for our approved product candidates, if any\n\u2022\nestablish, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights\n\u2022\nattract, hire and retain qualified personnel\nIn addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with clinical product development, including that our product candidates may not successfully advance through development or achieve regulatory approval, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of any potential future product sales revenues. Our expenses also could increase beyond expectations if we decide to or are required by FDA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to perform studies or trials to satisfy additional unexpected activities in addition to those that we currently anticipate.\nEven if we complete the development and regulatory processes described above, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with launching and commercializing these products.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, increased costs and risks as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d), as well as rules and regulations implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Capital Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d). Changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of SOX and rules adopted by the SEC and by Nasdaq, have resulted in, and will continue to result in, increased costs as we respond to their requirements. Given the risks inherent in the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting is uncertain. If our internal controls are not designed or operating effectively, we may not be able to conclude an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as required or we or our independent registered public accounting firm may determine that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. We currently have a very limited workforce, and it may be difficult to adhere to appropriate internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure controls with such limited staffing. We are not yet subject to the provisions of section 404(b) of SOX, which would require our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s attestation on management\u2019s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting. Investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and which could affect our ability to run our business effectively. Being a public company could also make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, our Board committees, and as executive officers.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, SOX and Nasdaq rules and regulations. SOX requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. We must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filing for that year, as required by Section 404 of SOX.\nAs discussed in this report, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that resulted in a restatement of our unaudited condensed interim financial statements for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021 relating to the Collaboration Agreement we entered into with Relief. Although we are committed to continuing to improve our internal control processes, and although we will continue to\ndiligently and vigorously review our internal controls over financial reporting, we cannot be certain that, in the future, a material weakness will not exist or otherwise be discovered. We may discover other weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, the market price of our common stock could decline and we could be subject to penalties or investigations by Nasdaq or the SEC.\nWe face risks related to health epidemics including but not limited to the COVID-19 pandemic which could adversely affect our business.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent pandemic of COVID-19, a respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus. While our employees work remotely a large part of the time, these effects could include disruptions or restrictions on our employees\u2019 ability to travel, as well as disruptions at or closures of our facilities or the facilities of our manufacturers and suppliers, which could adversely impact our development activities and other operations. Health professionals may reduce staffing and reduce or postpone meetings with clients, colleagues, and others in response to the spread of an infectious disease. Such events may result in a period of business disruption, and in reduced operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn or volatility that could adversely affect our manufacturers and suppliers and otherwise adversely impact our development activities and other operations.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition is difficult to predict. The outbreak could potentially affect the business of FDA, EMA or other health authorities, which could result in delays in meetings related to our product candidates and our planned clinical trials and ultimately in the review and approval of our product candidates. The spread of COVID-19 may also slow potential enrollment of clinical trials and reduce the number of eligible patients for our clinical trials, thereby making recruitment more difficult and competitive. Prolonged disruptions to businesses, manufacturing and supply chain, including shelter-in-place or similar orders imposed by federal, state or local government authorities, and economic downturns can lead to material adverse effects on our business operations, including layoffs and/or suspension of our business operations. The COVID-19 outbreak and mitigation measures also have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on global economic conditions which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition, including impairing our ability to raise capital when and in the amount needed. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. In addition, any COVID-19 infection of any of our employees could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business.\nWe face substantial competitive and other risks in our ACER-2820 program, aimed against a variety of infectious diseases including COVID-19, and we may be unable to raise non-dilutive capital to continue the program.\nWe have a development program for ACER-2820, a host-directed therapy against a variety of viruses, including COVID-19. There are many companies addressing COVID-19, both in therapeutic treatment and vaccines, many of which have significantly greater resources and capital than we do. Recent positive events in the development of one or more vaccines may reduce the demand for therapeutic products addressing COVID-19. The\ncompetition for funding research and development in this disease is intense and most of our competitors have greater resources available to them. Regulatory requirements in this area are in flux and will likely remain uncertain. Further advancement of the ACER-2820 program in COVID-19 and other infectious diseases is dependent on our ability to raise non-dilutive capital. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate financing to carry out our development plan or that, even if funding is obtained, our development of ACER-2820 will be successful, timely, and accepted by appropriate regulatory authorities.\nAny acquisitions that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nWe expect to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or technologies worldwide. We may also consider joint ventures, licensing and other collaborative projects. We may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates or strategic partners, or successfully negotiate, finance or integrate acquisitions of any businesses, products or technologies. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition and management of any collaborative project may divert our management\u2019s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. As a company, we have limited experience with acquiring other companies, or with acquiring products outside of the U.S. Any cash acquisition we pursue would divert the cash we have on our balance sheet from our present clinical development programs. Any stock acquisitions would dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership.\nRisks Related to the Clinical Development and Marketing Approval of Our Product Candidates\nThe marketing approval processes of FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, including ACER-001 for which we received FDA\u2019s acceptance for filing and substantive review of our NDA in October 2021, our business will be substantially harmed.\nNone of our current product candidates have gained marketing approval for sale in the U.S. or any other country, and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have marketable products. Our business is substantially dependent on our ability to complete the development of, obtain marketing approval for, and successfully commercialize our product candidates in a timely manner. We cannot commercialize our product candidates in the U.S. without first obtaining approval from FDA to market each product candidate. Similarly, we cannot commercialize our product candidates outside of the U.S. without obtaining regulatory approval from comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Our product candidates could fail to receive marketing approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication\n\u2022\nthe results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of any clinical trials we conduct or rely upon for regulatory approval\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may find the human subject protections for our clinical trials inadequate and place a clinical hold on an IND at the time of its submission precluding commencement of any trials or a clinical hold on one or more clinical trials at any time during the conduct of our clinical trials\n\u2022\nthe FDA could determine that we cannot rely on Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA for any or all of our product candidates, and we may be required to conduct clinical trials or provide other forms of substantial evidence of effectiveness instead of, or in addition to, relying on third-party data, as is the position of FDA with respect to our NDA for EDSIVOTM\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials\n\u2022\nthe FDA could determine that we have identified the wrong reference listed drug or drugs or that approval of our 505(b)(2) application for any of our product candidates is blocked by patent or non-patent exclusivity of the reference listed drug or drugs\n\u2022\nthe data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an application to obtain marketing approval in the U.S. or elsewhere\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may find inadequate the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner that would delay marketing approval\nBefore obtaining marketing approval for the commercial sale of any drug product for a target indication, we must demonstrate in preclinical studies and well-controlled clinical trials and, to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authorities, that the product is safe and effective for its intended use and that the manufacturing facilities, processes, and controls are adequate to preserve the drug\u2019s identity, strength, quality and purity. In the U.S., it is necessary to submit and obtain approval of an NDA from FDA. An NDA must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish the product safety and efficacy for each desired indication. The NDA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls for the product. After the submission but before approval of the NDA, the manufacturing facilities used to manufacture a product candidate must be inspected by FDA to ensure compliance with the applicable cGMP requirements. The FDA and the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, may also inspect our clinical trial sites and audit clinical study data to ensure that our studies are properly conducted in accordance with the IND regulations, human subject protection regulations, and cGCP.\nObtaining approval of an NDA is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and approval may not be obtained. Upon submission of an NDA, FDA must make an initial determination that the application is sufficiently complete to accept the submission for filing. We cannot be certain that any submissions, even those that are or have been accepted for filing and reviewed by FDA, will ultimately be approved. If the application is not accepted for review, FDA may require that we conduct additional clinical studies or preclinical testing or take other actions before it will reconsider our application. If FDA requires additional studies or data, we would incur increased costs and delays in the marketing approval process, which may require us to reduce headcount or other expenses and/or expend more resources than we have available. In addition, FDA may not consider any additional information to be complete or sufficient to support the filing or approval of the NDA.\nRegulatory authorities outside of the U.S., such as in Europe and Japan and in emerging markets, also have requirements for approval of drugs for commercial sale with which we must comply prior to marketing in those areas. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our product candidates. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted or the results may not be found adequate by regulatory authorities in other countries, and obtaining regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. However, the failure to obtain regulatory approval in one jurisdiction could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain approval in a different jurisdiction. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product candidate testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could require additional non-clinical studies or clinical trials, which could be costly and time-consuming. Foreign regulatory approval may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. For all of these reasons, we may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all.\nThe process to develop, obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize product candidates is long, complex and costly, both inside and outside of the U.S., and approval is never guaranteed. The time required to obtain approval by FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical\ndata necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. Even if our product candidates were to successfully obtain approval from regulatory authorities, any such approval might significantly limit the approved indications for use, including more limited patient populations, require that precautions, warnings or contraindications be included on the product labeling, including black box warnings, require expensive and time-consuming post-approval clinical studies, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies or surveillance as conditions of approval, or, through the product label, the approval may limit the claims that we may make, which may impede the successful commercialization of our product candidates. Following any approval for commercial sale of our product candidates, certain changes to the product, such as changes in manufacturing processes and additional labeling claims, as well as new safety information, may require new studies and will be subject to additional FDA notification, or review and approval. Also, marketing approval for any of our product candidates may be withdrawn. If we are unable to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates in one or more jurisdictions, or any approval contains significant limitations, our ability to market to our full target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be impaired. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue and cash flows to continue or complete the development of any of our current or future product candidates.\nIf we are unable to obtain approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA or if we are required to generate additional data related to safety or efficacy in order to seek approval under Section 505(b)(2), we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines, and could decide not to pursue further development, depending on the expected time, cost, and risks associated with generating any such additional data.\nTraditional drug development typically relies upon Section 505(b)(1) of the FFDCA for seeking marketing authorization in the U.S., where the sponsor of the product candidate (i.e., the applicant for marketing authorization) is required to conduct all of the studies needed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of such candidate. Although we may consider a Section 505(b)(1) pathway in the future, our current strategy for seeking marketing authorization in the U.S. for our product candidates (including ACER-001 and EDSIVO\u2122) relies at least in part on Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA, which permits use of a marketing application, referred to as a 505(b)(2) application, where at least some of the information needed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidate at issue for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use. The FDA interprets this to mean that an applicant may rely for approval on such data as that found in published literature or FDA\u2019s finding of safety or effectiveness, or both, of a previously approved drug product owned by a third party. There is no assurance that FDA would find third-party data relied upon by us in a 505(b)(2) application sufficient or adequate to support approval, and FDA may require us to generate additional data to support the safety and efficacy of our product candidates. Depending on the time, nature, risk, and cost of obtaining that data or undertaking the required activities, we may decide that we are not able or willing to proceed with development, and may or may not reduce headcount and spending accordingly.\nFor example, in June 2019, we received a Complete Response Letter from FDA regarding our NDA for EDSIVO\u2122 for the treatment of vEDS. The Complete Response Letter stated that it will be necessary to conduct an adequate and well-controlled trial to determine whether celiprolol reduces the risk of clinical events in patients with vEDS. In light of FDA\u2019s Complete Response Letter regarding our NDA for EDSIVOTM, we halted precommercial activities. In December 2019, we submitted a Formal Dispute Resolution Request to the Office of New Drugs appealing FDA\u2019s decision as outlined in the Complete Response Letter. In March 2020, we received a response to our Formal Dispute Resolution Request from the Office of New Drugs of FDA stating that it had denied our appeal of the Complete Response Letter in relation to the NDA for EDSIVOTM. In its Appeal Denied letter, the Office of New Drugs (i) described possible paths forward for us to explore that could provide the substantial evidence of effectiveness needed to support a potential resubmission of the EDSIVOTM NDA for the treatment of patients with vEDS with a confirmed COL3A1 mutation and (ii) referred to the FDA Guidance document issued in December 2019, where substantial evidence of effectiveness can be provided by two or more adequate and well-controlled studies demonstrating efficacy, or a single positive adequate and well-controlled study plus confirmatory evidence.\nFollowing a Type B meeting with FDA in the second quarter of 2021, we are now planning a U.S.-based prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, decentralized pivotal clinical trial in patients with COL3A1+ vEDS, which we refer to as the DiSCOVER trial. The proposed design features of the study discussed\nwith FDA include: the acceptability of a decentralized (virtual) clinical trial design and use of an independent centralized adjudication committee; acceptability of a primary endpoint based on clinical events associated with disease outcome; agreement with modest safety data collection (based on the known safety profile of the drug) and no PK data needing to be collected; and a statistical plan that considers the rare disease classification of vEDS. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we submitted a protocol for the prospective pivotal trial, along with an IND. In January 2022, we also requested breakthrough therapy designation and we are working with FDA to reach agreement on a SPA. Based on initial power calculations, we anticipate that the trial should plan to enroll approximately 200 COL3A1+ vEDS patients in the U.S., and the duration of the clinical trial is estimated to be approximately 3.5 years to complete once fully enrolled. If agreement is reached with FDA on our proposed SPA, initiation of the EDSIVOTM DiSCOVER pivotal clinical trial is expected in the second quarter of 2022, subject to additional capital. There can be no assurance that the resulting data from the trial would be adequate to support approval of our NDA. We may also conclude at any point that the cost, risk and uncertainty of obtaining that additional data does not justify continuing with the development of EDSIVO\u2122.\nIf the data to be relied upon in a 505(b)(2) application are related to drug products previously approved by FDA and covered by patents that are listed in FDA\u2019s Orange Book, we would be required to submit with our 505(b)(2) application a Paragraph IV Certification in which we must certify that we do not infringe the listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, and provide notice to the patent owner or the holder of the approved NDA. The patent owner or NDA holder would have 45 days from receipt of the notification of our Paragraph IV Certification to initiate a patent infringement action against us. If an infringement action is initiated, the approval of our NDA would be subject to a stay of up to 30 months or more while we defend against such a suit. Approval of our product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) may, therefore, be delayed until patent exclusivity expires or until we successfully challenge the applicability of those patents to our product candidates. Alternatively, we might elect a Section 505(b)(1) pathway to generate sufficient clinical data so that we would no longer need to rely on third-party data. However, a Section 505(b)(1) pathway would likely be costly and time-consuming and there would be no assurance that such data generated from such additional activities would be sufficient to seek or obtain approval.\nWe may not be able to obtain shortened review of our applications, and FDA may not agree that our product candidates qualify for marketing approval. If we are required to generate additional data to support approval, we may be unable to meet anticipated or reasonable development and commercialization timelines, may be unable to generate the additional data at a reasonable cost, or at all, and may be unable to obtain marketing approval of our product candidates. If FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) allowing reliance on data in a previously approved drug application owned by a third party, or if there is a change in the law affecting Section 505(b)(2), this could delay or even prevent FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) application that we submit.\nMarketing approval may be substantially delayed or may not be obtained for one or all of our product candidates if regulatory authorities require additional or more studies to assess the safety and efficacy of our product candidates. We could decide not to pursue further development of one or all of our product candidates, depending on, among other things, the expected time, cost, and risks associated with generating any such additional data.\nWe may be unable to initiate or complete development of our product candidates on schedule, if at all. The completion of the studies for certain of our product candidates will require us to obtain substantial additional funding beyond our current resources. In addition, regulatory authorities may require additional or more time-consuming studies to assess the safety or efficacy of our product candidates than we are currently planning. For example, in June 2019, we received a Complete Response Letter from FDA regarding our NDA for EDSIVO\u2122 for the treatment of vEDS. The Complete Response Letter stated that it will be necessary to conduct an adequate and well-controlled trial to determine whether celiprolol reduces the risk of clinical events in patients with vEDS. In light of FDA\u2019s Complete Response Letter regarding our NDA for EDSIVOTM, we halted precommercial activities. In December 2019, we submitted a Formal Dispute Resolution Request to the Office of New Drugs appealing FDA\u2019s decision as outlined in the Complete Response Letter. In March 2020, we received a response to our Formal Dispute Resolution Request from the Office of New Drugs of FDA stating that it had denied our appeal of the Complete Response Letter in relation to the NDA for EDSIVO\u2122. In its Appeal Denied letter, the Office of New Drugs (i) described possible paths forward for us to explore that could provide the substantial evidence of\neffectiveness needed to support a potential resubmission of the EDSIVO\u2122 NDA for the treatment of patients with vEDS with a confirmed COL3A1 mutation and (ii) referred to the FDA Guidance document issued in December 2019, where substantial evidence of effectiveness can be provided by two or more adequate and well-controlled studies demonstrating efficacy, or a single positive adequate and well-controlled study plus confirmatory evidence.\nFollowing a Type B meeting with FDA in the second quarter of 2021, we are now planning a U.S.-based prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, decentralized pivotal clinical trial in patients with COL3A1+ vEDS, which we refer to as the DiSCOVER trial.

There can be no assurance that the resulting data from the trial would be adequate to support approval of our NDA. We may also conclude at any point that the cost, risk and uncertainty of obtaining that additional data does not justify continuing with the development of EDSIVO\u2122.\nWe currently do not have, and may not be able to obtain, adequate funding to complete the necessary steps for approval for any or all of our product candidates. Additional delays may result if FDA, an FDA Advisory Committee (if one is convened to review any NDA we file) or another regulatory authority indicates that a product candidate should not be approved or there should be restrictions on approval, such as the requirement for a REMS, to ensure the safe use of the drug. Delays in marketing approval or rejections of applications for marketing approval in the U.S. or other markets may result from many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or comparable foreign regulatory authorities\u2019 disagreement with the design or implementation of any clinical trials we conduct or rely on for regulatory approval\n\u2022\nregulatory requests for additional analyses, reports, data, non-clinical and preclinical studies and clinical trials\n\u2022\nregulatory questions or disagreement by FDA or comparable regulatory authorities regarding interpretations of data and results and the emergence of new information regarding our current or future product candidates or the field of research\n\u2022\nunfavorable or inconclusive results of clinical trials and supportive non-clinical studies, including unfavorable results regarding safety or efficacy of our product candidates during clinical trials\n\u2022\nfailure to meet the level of statistical significance required for approval\n\u2022\ninability to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks\n\u2022\nlack of adequate funding to commence or continue our clinical trials due to unforeseen costs or other business decisions\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may find inadequate the manufacturing processes or facilities of the third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies\n\u2022\nwe may have insufficient funds to pay the significant user fees required by FDA upon the filing of an NDA\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner that would delay marketing approval\nThe lengthy and unpredictable approval process, as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results, may result in our failure to obtain marketing approval to market our product candidates, which would significantly\nharm our business, results of operations and prospects and could lead to reduction in headcount, including those employees recently hired to assist in commercial launch and marketing of our products, including but not limited to ACER-001.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome. Clinical development of product candidates for rare diseases carries additional risks, such as recruiting patients in a very small patient population.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. The FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and determining when or whether marketing approval will be obtained for our current product candidates. Even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our current product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by FDA or comparable foreign authorities. Our future clinical trial results may not be successful.\nIt is impossible to predict the extent to which the clinical trial process may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments. Due to these and other factors, our current product candidates or future product candidates could take a significantly longer time to gain marketing approval than expected or may never gain marketing approval. This could delay or eliminate any potential product revenue by delaying or terminating the potential commercialization of our current product candidates.\nPreclinical trials must also be conducted in accordance with FDA and comparable foreign authorities\u2019 legal requirements, regulations or guidelines, including cGLP, an international standard meant to harmonize the conduct and quality of nonclinical studies and the archiving and reporting of findings. Preclinical studies including long-term toxicity studies and carcinogenicity studies in animals may result in findings that may require further evaluation, which could affect the risk-benefit evaluation of clinical development, or which may lead the regulatory agencies to delay, prohibit the initiation of or halt clinical trials or delay or deny marketing authorization applications. Failure to adhere to the applicable cGLP standards or misconduct during the course of preclinical trials may invalidate the data and require one or more studies to be repeated or additional testing to be conducted.\nClinical trials must also be conducted in accordance with FDA and comparable foreign authorities\u2019 legal requirements, regulations or guidelines, including human subject protection requirements and cGCP. Clinical trials are subject to further oversight by these governmental agencies and IRBs, at the medical institutions where the clinical trials are conducted. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with supplies of our current product candidates produced under cGMP and other requirements. Clinical trials are usually conducted at multiple sites, potentially including some sites in countries outside the U.S. and the EU, which may subject us to further delays and expenses as a result of increased shipment costs, additional regulatory requirements and the engagement of foreign and non-EU clinical research organizations, as well as expose us to risks associated with clinical investigators who are unknown to FDA or the European regulatory authorities, and with different standards of diagnosis, screening and medical care.\nThe commencement and completion of clinical trials for our current product candidates may be delayed, suspended or terminated as a result of many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe delay or refusal of regulators or IRBs to authorize us to commence a clinical trial at a prospective trial site and changes in regulatory requirements, policies and guidelines\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities disagreeing as to the design or implementation of our clinical trials\n\u2022\nfailure to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites\n\u2022\ndelays in patient enrollment and variability in the number and types of patients available for clinical trials\n\u2022\nthe inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients in trials to ensure adequate statistical power to detect statistically significant treatment effects\n\u2022\nlower than anticipated retention rates of patients and volunteers in clinical trials\n\u2022\nclinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial\n\u2022\nadding new clinical trial sites\n\u2022\nnegative or inconclusive results, which may require us to conduct additional preclinical or clinical trials or to abandon projects that we expect to be promising\n\u2022\nsafety or tolerability concerns could cause us to suspend or terminate a trial if we find that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks\n\u2022\nregulators or IRBs requiring that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements\n\u2022\nour third-party research and manufacturing contractors failing to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all\n\u2022\ndifficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment, resulting in incomplete data\n\u2022\ndelays in establishing the appropriate dosage levels\n\u2022\nthe quality or stability of our current product candidates falling below acceptable standards\n\u2022\nthe inability to produce or obtain sufficient quantities of our current product candidates to complete clinical trials\n\u2022\nexceeding budgeted costs due to difficulty in predicting accurately the costs associated with clinical trials\nPatient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials and is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs or treatments that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may materially adversely affect our ability to recruit qualified subjects for our clinical trials for our product candidates. It is impossible to predict that impact on our clinical trials and our business.\nThere are significant requirements imposed on us and on clinical investigators who conduct clinical trials that we sponsor. Although we are responsible for selecting qualified clinical investigators, providing them with the information they need to conduct the clinical trial properly, ensuring proper monitoring of the clinical trial, and ensuring that the clinical trial is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols contained in the IND, we cannot ensure the clinical investigators will maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements at all times. The pharmaceutical industry has experienced cases where clinical investigators have been found to incorrectly record data, omit data, or even falsify data. We cannot ensure that the clinical investigators in our trials will not make mistakes or otherwise compromise the integrity or validity of data, any of which would have a significant negative effect on our ability to obtain marketing approval, our business, and our financial condition.\nWe could encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such trial is being conducted, by the DSMB for such trial, or by FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. We or such authorities may impose a suspension or termination due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using the drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. If we experience delays in the completion or termination of any clinical trial of our current product candidates, the commercial prospects of our current product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from our product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical\ntrials will increase our costs, slow our development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of our product candidates.\nAny of these occurrences could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of our current product candidates. Significant clinical trial delays could also allow our competitors to bring products to market before we are able to do so, shorten any periods during which we have the exclusive right to commercialize our current product candidates and impair our ability to commercialize our current product candidates, which may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development. Because the results of earlier clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate we advance through clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive marketing approval.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of our clinical development. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical or preclinical testing. Data obtained from tests are susceptible to varying interpretations, and regulators may not interpret our data as favorably as we do, which may delay, limit or prevent marketing approval.\nIn addition, the design of a clinical trial can determine whether our results will support approval of a product or approval of a product for desired indications, and flaws or shortcomings in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. Further, clinical trials of potential products often reveal that it is not practical or feasible to continue development efforts. If one of our product candidates is found to be unsafe or lack efficacy, we will not be able to obtain marketing approval for it and our business would be harmed. For example, if the results of our clinical trials of our product candidates do not achieve pre-specified endpoints or we are unable to provide primary or secondary endpoint measurements deemed acceptable by FDA or comparable foreign regulators or if we are unable to demonstrate an acceptable level of safety relative to the efficacy associated with our proposed indications, the prospects for approval of our product candidates would be materially and adversely affected. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including those with greater resources and experience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety and/or efficacy results between different trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including differences in trial protocols and design, the size and type of the patient population, adherence to the dosing regimen and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. We do not know whether any clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate consistent and/or adequate efficacy and safety to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates.\nAs an organization, we have limited experience in designing and completing clinical trials and may be unable to do so efficiently or at all for our current product candidates or any product candidate we develop.\nWe will need to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates. The conduct of clinical trials and the submission of a successful NDA is a complicated process. As an organization, we have limited experience in designing and completing clinical trials, and we have limited experience in preparing and submitting regulatory filings. Consequently, we may be unable to successfully and efficiently execute and complete necessary clinical trials in a way that leads to NDA submission and approval of our product candidates. We may require more time and incur greater costs than anticipated and may not succeed in obtaining marketing approval of the product candidates\nwe develop. Failure to commence or complete, or delays in, our planned clinical trials would prevent us from or delay us in commercializing our current product candidates or any other product candidate we develop.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their marketing approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if obtained.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of marketing approval by FDA or other comparable foreign authorities. If any of our current product candidates or any other product candidate we develop is associated with serious adverse, undesirable or unacceptable side effects, we may need to abandon such candidate\u2019s development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which such side effects are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many compounds that initially showed promise in early-stage or clinical testing have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound. Results of our trials could reveal a high and unacceptable prevalence of these or other side effects. In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated, and FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims.\nIf our product candidates receive marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product\n\u2022\nwe may be required to recall a product or change the way such product is administered to patients\n\u2022\nadditional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of the particular product or the manufacturing process for the product or any component thereof\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a precaution, \u201cblack box\u201d warning or other warnings or a contraindication\n\u2022\nwe or our collaborators may be required to implement a REMS or create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effect for distribution to patients\n\u2022\nwe or our collaborators could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients\n\u2022\nthe product may become less competitive\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nEven if we receive marketing approval for our product candidates, such approved products will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions, and we may be subject to penalties and legal sanctions if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our approved products.\nIf FDA approves any of our product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMP regulations and GCP for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Any marketing approvals that we receive for our product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be\nmarketed or to conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor safety and efficacy.\nLater discovery of previously unknown problems with an approved product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing operations or processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, or evidence of acts that raise questions about the integrity of data supporting the product approval, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls\n\u2022\nfines, warning letters, or holds on clinical trials\n\u2022\nrefusal by FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, or suspension or revocation of product approvals\n\u2022\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties\nThe FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay marketing approval, manufacturing or commercialization of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\nAgencies such as FDA and national competition regulators in European countries regulate the promotion and uses of drugs not consistent with approved product labeling requirements. If we are found to have improperly promoted our current product candidates for uses beyond those that are approved, we may become subject to significant liability.\nRegulatory authorities such as FDA and national competition agencies in Europe strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products, such as ACER-001, ACER-801, EDSIVOTM, or ACER-2820, if approved. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling, known as \u201coff-label\u201d use, nor may it be promoted prior to obtaining marketing approval. If we receive marketing approval for our product candidates for our proposed indications, physicians may nevertheless use our products for their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label if the physicians personally believe in their professional medical judgment it could be used in such manner. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.\nIn addition, FDA requires that promotional claims not be \u201cfalse or misleading\u201d as such terms are defined in FDA\u2019s regulations. For example, FDA requires substantial evidence, which generally consists of two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, for a company to make a claim that its product is superior to another product in terms of safety or effectiveness. Generally, unless we perform clinical trials meeting that standard comparing our product candidates to competitive products and these claims are approved in our product labeling, we will not be able promote our current product candidates as superior to other products. If we are found to have made such claims, we may become subject to significant liability. In the U.S., the federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in improper promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements. The FDA could also seek permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is monitored, changed or curtailed.\nOur current and future relationships with healthcare professionals, investigators, consultants, collaborators, actual customers, potential customers and third-party payors in the U.S. and elsewhere may be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician payment transparency, health information privacy and security and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to sanctions.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the U.S. and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, investigators, consultants, collaborators, actual customers, potential customers and third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act, that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we sell, market and distribute any drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to physician payment transparency laws and patient privacy and security regulation by the U.S. federal government and states and by the foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include the following:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government\n\u2022\nthe civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent\n\u2022\nHIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private), knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (\u201cHITECH\u201d) and its implementing regulations, which impose obligations on covered entities, including healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without proper written authorization\n\u2022\nthe federal Open Payments program, created under Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, which imposed annual reporting requirements for manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for certain payments and \u201ctransfers of value\u201d provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, where failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required\ninformation for all covered payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties\n\u2022\nanalogous state and foreign laws, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts\nFurther, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal statutes governing healthcare fraud. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nEfforts to ensure that our future business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could significantly harm our business. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business, including our current and future collaborators, if any, are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, those persons or entities may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also affect our business.\nThe impact of recent healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and healthcare spending on us is currently unknown and may adversely affect our business model.\nIn the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions, legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system could prevent or delay marketing approval of our drug candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nOur revenue prospects could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy in the U.S. and abroad. We operate in a highly regulated industry and new laws and judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws or decisions, related to healthcare availability, the method of delivery or payment for healthcare products and services could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. There is significant interest in promoting healthcare reform, as evidenced by the enactment in the U.S. of the Affordable Care Act. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, revising the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, extending the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, imposing mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and subjecting drug manufacturers to payment of an annual fee.\nWe expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs\nmay result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue or commercialize our drugs.\nIt is likely that federal and state legislatures within the U.S. and foreign governments will continue to consider changes to existing healthcare legislation including the Affordable Care Act. It is also possible that the executive branch may take certain steps by executive action which could modify or solidify aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Certain stakeholders are also pursuing litigation challenging certain provisions which, if successful, would have the effect of modifying some or all of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act. We cannot predict the reform initiatives that may be adopted or litigation outcomes in the future or whether initiatives that have been adopted will be repealed or modified. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect:\n\u2022\nthe demand for any drug products for which we may obtain marketing approval\n\u2022\nour ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement approval for a product\n\u2022\nour ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability\n\u2022\nthe level of taxes that we are required to pay\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur research and development activities and our third-party manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 activities involve the controlled storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials, including the components of our product candidates and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our and our manufacturers\u2019 facilities pending their use and disposal. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling, and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by us and our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of specified materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. We do not currently carry biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage.\nOther Risks Related to Our Business\nIf we fail to attract and retain key management and scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates.\nOur success as a pharmaceutical company depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and scientific and clinical personnel. The loss of the services of any of our senior management could delay or prevent obtaining marketing approval or commercialization of our product candidates.\nOur 2019 restructuring may have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. In order to reduce operating expenses and conserve cash resources following receipt of the Complete Response Letter\nwe received from FDA regarding our NDA for EDSIVO\u2122 for the treatment of vEDS in June 2019, we implemented a corporate restructuring initiative including a reduction of approximately 60% of our full-time workforce of 48 employees and a halt of precommercial activities for EDSIVO\u2122. As of February 15, 2022, we had a workforce of 35 full-time employees, in addition to several consultants or independent contractors, to conduct our planned business operations. If our projections prove to be inaccurate or if we are forced to implement any further workforce reductions, we may not have sufficient staffing to pursue our research and development goals.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and scientific personnel in the future due to the intense competition for a limited number of qualified personnel among pharmaceutical businesses, and other pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other businesses. Our failure to attract, hire, integrate and retain qualified personnel could impair our ability to achieve our business objectives.\nWe may not be able to win government, academic institution or non-profit contracts or grants, which could affect the timing or continued development of one or more of our product candidates, and ACER-2820 in particular.\nFrom time to time, we may apply for contracts or grants from government agencies, non-profit entities and academic institutions. For example, we are pursuing several financing options, including federally-funded research contracts and grants and other potentially non-dilutive funding sources, to fund our planned ACER-2820 development program for the potential treatment of patients with COVID-19. Such contracts or grants can be highly attractive because they provide capital to fund the ongoing development of our product candidates without diluting our stockholders. However, there is often significant competition for these contracts or grants. Entities offering contracts or grants may have requirements to apply for or to otherwise be eligible for certain contracts or grants that our competitors may be able to satisfy that we cannot. In addition, such entities may make unfavorable decisions as to whether to offer contracts or make grants, to whom the contracts or grants may or will be awarded and the size of the contracts or grants to each awardee. Even if we are able to satisfy the award requirements, there is no guarantee that we will be a successful awardee. Therefore, we may not be able to win any contracts or grants in a timely manner, if at all.\nIf a successful product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities, we could be forced to pay substantial damage awards.\nThe use of any of our product candidates in clinical trials, and the sale of any approved products, may expose us to product liability claims. We currently maintain product liability insurance coverage in amounts we consider to be reasonable for our stage of development. We intend to monitor the amount of coverage we maintain as the size and design of our clinical trials evolve, and if we are successful in obtaining approval to commercialize any of our product candidates, adjust the amount of coverage we maintain accordingly. However, there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will fully protect us against some or all of the claims to which we might become subject. We might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against potential losses. In the event a claim is brought against us, we might be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim, as well as uncovered damages awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us.\nFurthermore, whether or not we are ultimately successful in defending any such claims, we might be required to direct financial and managerial resources to such defense and adverse publicity could result, all of which could harm our business.\nOur employees, independent contractors, investigators, contract research organizations, consultants, collaborators and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees and other third parties may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by employees and other third parties could include intentional, reckless and/or\nnegligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violate FDA regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to FDA, manufacturing standards, federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, or laws that require the reporting of financial information or data accurately. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee and other third-party misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our development collaborators, third-party clinical research organizations or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer cybersecurity or other security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future CROs and other contractors, consultants and collaborators are vulnerable to cybersecurity breaches and damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our marketing approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we intend to rely on third parties to manufacture our product candidates and conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or cybersecurity or other security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed, and our reputation could be harmed. In addition, there are known cyberattacks against pharmaceutical companies engaged in development of therapeutic or vaccine products addressing COVID-19. Our ACER-2820 program is one such program that could attract the attention of cyber attackers.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nOur product candidate EDSIVOTM has not been approved for any indication in the U.S. and, in June 2019, we received a Complete Response Letter from FDA stating that it will be necessary to conduct an adequate and well-controlled trial to determine whether celiprolol reduces the risk of clinical events in patients with vEDS. We are now planning a pivotal clinical trial in patients with COL3A1+ vEDS. There can be no assurance that our plan will be accepted by FDA or that we will be able to provide adequate data to meet that standard. This may also result in greater research and development expenses or regulatory issues that could further delay or prevent approval.\nEDSIVOTM is a repurposing of celiprolol for the treatment of vEDS. An NDA for this drug for the treatment of hypertension was submitted to FDA in 1987, however, the NDA was withdrawn prior to review. Celiprolol has, however, been approved in Europe for the treatment of hypertension since 1984. Regulatory approval of EDSIVOTM may be more expensive and take longer than for other, more well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical product candidates due to our and regulatory agencies\u2019 lack of experience with celiprolol. In June 2019, we received a Complete Response Letter from FDA regarding our NDA for EDSIVOTM (celiprolol) for the treatment of vEDS.\nThe Complete Response Letter stated that it will be necessary to conduct an adequate and well-controlled trial to determine whether celiprolol reduces the risk of clinical events in patients with vEDS. In light of FDA\u2019s Complete Response Letter regarding our NDA for EDSIVOTM, we halted precommercial activities. We had previously devoted a substantial majority of our research, development, clinical, and precommercial efforts and financial resources towards the development of EDSIVO\u2122. In order to reduce operating expenses and conserve cash resources, in June 2019, we implemented a corporate restructuring which included a reduction of approximately 60% of our full-time workforce of 48 employees and halted precommercial activities for EDSIVOTM. In December 2019, we submitted a Formal Dispute Resolution Request to FDA\u2019s Office of New Drugs appealing FDA\u2019s decision outlined in the Complete Response Letter. In March 2020, we received a response to our Formal Dispute Resolution Request from the Office of New Drugs of FDA stating that it had denied our appeal of the Complete Response Letter in relation to the NDA for EDSIVOTM. In its Appeal Denied letter, the Office of New Drugs (i) described possible paths forward for Acer to explore that could provide the substantial evidence of effectiveness needed to support a potential resubmission of the EDSIVOTM NDA for the treatment of patients with vEDS with a confirmed COL3A1 mutation and (ii) referred to the FDA Guidance document issued in December 2019, where substantial evidence of effectiveness can be provided by two or more adequate and well-controlled studies demonstrating efficacy, or a single positive adequate and well-controlled study plus confirmatory evidence.\nFollowing a Type B meeting with FDA in the second quarter of 2021, we are now planning a U.S.-based prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, decentralized pivotal clinical trial in patients with COL3A1+ vEDS, which we refer to as the DiSCOVER trial. The proposed design features of the study discussed with FDA include: the acceptability of a decentralized (virtual) clinical trial design and use of an independent centralized adjudication committee; acceptability of a primary endpoint based on clinical events associated with disease outcome; agreement with modest safety data collection (based on the known safety profile of the drug) and no PK data needing to be collected; and a statistical plan that considers the rare disease classification of vEDS. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we submitted a protocol for the prospective pivotal trial, along with an IND. In January 2022, we also requested breakthrough therapy designation and we are working with FDA to reach agreement on a SPA. Based on initial power calculations, we anticipate that the trial should plan to enroll approximately 200 COL3A1+ vEDS patients in the U.S., and the duration of the clinical trial is estimated to be approximately 3.5 years to complete once fully enrolled. If agreement is reached with FDA on our proposed SPA, initiation of the EDSIVOTM DiSCOVER pivotal clinical trial is expected in the second quarter of 2022, subject to additional capital. There can be no assurance that the resulting data from the trial would be adequate to support approval of our NDA. We may also conclude at any point that the cost, risk, and uncertainty of obtaining that additional data does not justify continuing with the development of EDSIVO\u2122.\nThe novelty of this product candidate may continue to lengthen the regulatory review process, ultimately require the conduct of one or more additional studies or clinical trials as a prerequisite to approval, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization, or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. There is also an increased risk that previously unknown or unanticipated adverse effects could be discovered during any clinical trials and beyond. Any such events could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we obtain the required regulatory approvals in the U.S. and other territories, the commercial success of our product candidates will depend on, among other factors, market awareness and acceptance of our product candidates.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for our current product candidates or any other product candidates that we may develop or acquire in the future, the products may not gain market acceptance among physicians, key opinion leaders, healthcare payors, patients and the medical community. Market acceptance of any approved products depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe timing of market introduction\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and safety of the product, as demonstrated in clinical trials\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which the product is approved and the label approved by regulatory authorities for use with the product, including any precautions, warnings or contraindications that may be required on the label\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians, key opinion leaders and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment\n\u2022\nthe cost, safety and efficacy of treatment in relation to alternative treatments\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities\n\u2022\nthe number and clinical profile of competing products\n\u2022\nthe growth of drug markets in our various indications\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration\n\u2022\nmarketing and distribution support\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse side effects\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts\nMarket acceptance is critical to our ability to generate revenue. Any product candidate, if approved and commercialized, may be accepted in only limited capacities or not at all. If any approved products are not accepted by the market to the extent that we expect, we may not be able to generate revenue and our business would suffer.\nIf the market opportunities for our product candidates to treat rare diseases are smaller than we believe they are, then our revenues may be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nThe diseases that some of our current and future product candidates are being developed to address are rare. Our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, and our assumptions relating to pricing are based on estimates. Given the small number of patients who have some of the diseases that we are targeting, our eligible patient population and pricing estimates may differ significantly from the actual market addressable by our product candidates.\nCurrently, most reported estimates of the prevalence of vEDS, UCD, and MSUD are based on studies of small subsets of the population of specific geographic areas, which are then extrapolated to estimate the prevalence of the diseases in the broader world population. It is difficult to precisely measure the incidence or prevalence of vEDS in any population. Studies estimate the prevalence of vEDS as ranging from approximately 1 in 90,000 to 1 in 250,000. In 2017, we commissioned a patient-finder study that phenotypically identified 4,169 vEDS patients in the U.S. from an analysis of a commercially available patient claims database, with data of approximately 190 million unique patient lives. Based on that information, we estimate the prevalence of phenotypically-defined vEDS in the U.S. could be greater than 1 in 45,000.\nStudies suggest that the incidence of UCD in the U.S. is 1 in 35,000 live births. Approximately 2,000 patients suffer from UCD in the U.S. Studies indicate that MSUD affects an estimated 1 in 185,000 infants worldwide. Approximately 3,000 patients suffer from MSUD worldwide, of whom approximately 1,000 are located in the U.S.\nIt is estimated that vEDS, UCD, and MSUD collectively impact approximately 7,000 patients in the U.S. As new studies are performed the estimated prevalence of these diseases may change. The number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected. There can be no assurance that the prevalence of vEDS, UCD or MSUD in the study populations accurately reflect the prevalence of these diseases in the broader world population. If our estimates of the prevalence of vEDS, UCD, or MSUD, or of the number of patients who may benefit from treatment with ACER-001 or EDSIVOTM prove to be incorrect, the market opportunities for our product candidates may be smaller than we believe they are, our prospects for generating revenue may be adversely affected and our business may suffer. Likewise, the potentially addressable patient population for each of these product candidates may be limited or may\nnot be amenable to treatment with our product candidates, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe currently have limited marketing and sales experience. If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any product sales revenue.\nWe have never commercialized a product candidate and, although precommercial activities had been conducted for EDSIVOTM prior to our receipt of FDA\u2019s Complete Response Letter regarding our NDA for EDSIVOTM, we currently do not have marketing, sales or distribution capabilities for our product candidates. In order to commercialize any of our products that receive marketing approval, we would have to build marketing, sales, medical affairs, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. In the event of successful development of our product candidates, if we elect to build a targeted specialty sales force, such an effort would be expensive and time consuming. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of these products. We may choose to collaborate with third parties that have their own sales forces and established distribution systems, in lieu of or to augment any sales force and distribution systems we may create. If we are unable to enter into collaborations with third parties for the commercialization of approved product candidates, if any, on acceptable terms or at all, or if any such collaborator does not devote sufficient resources to the commercialization of our product or otherwise fails in commercialization efforts, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates if we receive marketing approval. If we are not successful in commercializing our product candidates, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our potential future revenue will be materially and adversely impacted.\nIf we fail to enter into strategic relationships or collaborations, our business, financial condition, commercialization prospects and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur product development programs and the potential commercialization of our current product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. Therefore, in addition to financing the development of our product candidates through additional equity financings or through debt financings, we may decide to enter into collaborations with pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical companies for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. We may also be restricted under existing and future collaboration agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with other potential collaborators. We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on acceptable terms, or at all. If that were to occur, we may have to curtail the development of a particular product, reduce or delay one or more of our development programs, delay our potential commercialization or reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring our product candidates to market and generate product revenue. If we do enter into a collaboration agreement, it could be subject to the following risks, each of which may materially harm our business, commercialization prospects and financial condition:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to control the amount or timing of resources that the collaborator devotes to the product development program\n\u2022\nthe collaborator may experience financial difficulties and thus not commit sufficient financial resources to the product development program\n\u2022\nwe may be required to relinquish important rights such as marketing, distribution and intellectual property rights\n\u2022\na collaborator could move forward with a competing product developed either independently or in collaboration with third parties, including our competitors\n\u2022\nbusiness combinations or significant changes in a collaborator\u2019s business strategy may adversely affect a collaborator\u2019s willingness to complete its obligations under any arrangement\nCoverage and reimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to third-party coverage and reimbursement of newly approved pharmaceuticals. Market acceptance and sales of any approved product candidates will depend significantly on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors and may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers, health maintenance organizations, and government payors like Medicare and Medicaid, decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for drugs and products. Coverage and reimbursement may not be available for any product that we commercialize and, even if coverage is provided, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory. Inadequate reimbursement levels may adversely affect the demand for, or the price of, any drug candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nReimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor\u2019s determination that use of a product is, among other things:\n\u2022\na covered benefit under its health plan\n\u2022\nsafe, effective and medically necessary\n\u2022\nappropriate for the specific patient\n\u2022\ncost-effective\n\u2022\nneither experimental nor investigational\nObtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies and provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products to the payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and adequate reimbursement. In addition to examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of new products, coverage may be limited to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. There may also be formulary placements that result in lower reimbursement levels and higher cost-sharing borne by patients, any of which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and profits. Moreover, a third-party payor\u2019s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor\u2019s decision to cover a particular drug product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product, or even if coverage is available, establish an adequate reimbursement rate. In addition, pricing of orphan and rare disease drug treatments is under increased pressure given the overall healthcare cost climate generally, and pricing of pharmaceutical products specifically.\nWe cannot be sure that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates. Also, we cannot be sure that reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to commercialize certain of our products. In the U.S., third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and\nreviewing the cost-effectiveness of drug products and medical services and questioning safety and efficacy. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third-party payors will reimburse patients for their use of newly approved drugs, which in turn will put pressure on the pricing of drugs. Additionally, emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the products for which we receive FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.\nCoverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation (including indirect techniques of pricing pressure, such as allowing reimportation from markets outside the U.S.) may change at any time, and there is the potential for significant movement in these areas in the foreseeable future. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products for our targeted indications before, or more successfully, than we do.\nThe life sciences industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from many pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are generally developing and marketing therapeutic products. Such competition may include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic companies and medical technology companies. Our future success depends on our ability to demonstrate and maintain a competitive advantage with respect to the design, development and commercialization of our product candidates for the treatment of orphan and ultra-orphan diseases for which there is a small patient population in the U.S. A drug designated an Orphan Drug may receive up to seven years of exclusive marketing in the U.S. for that indication. Our objective is to design, develop and commercialize product candidates by repurposing or reformulating existing drugs, generally for orphan diseases, with significant unmet medical needs.\nMany of our potential competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, development, technical and human resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in particular, have extensive experience in clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals, recruiting patients and in manufacturing clinical products. These companies also have significantly greater research and marketing capabilities than we do and may also have products that have been approved or are in late stages of development, and have collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions. Established companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of compounds that could make the product candidates that we develop obsolete. As a result of all of these factors, the obtaining of Orphan Drug designation for our product candidates to treat rare diseases is highly desirable to our viability since our competitors may, among other things:\n\u2022\nhave greater name and brand recognition, financial and human resources\n\u2022\ndevelop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, less expensive, or more convenient or easier to administer\n\u2022\nobtain quicker marketing approval\n\u2022\nestablish superior proprietary positions\n\u2022\nhave access to more manufacturing capacity as well as to more cost-effective manufacturing capacity\n\u2022\nimplement more effective approaches to sales and marketing\n\u2022\nform more advantageous strategic alliances\nShould any of these events occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially adversely affected. If we are not able to compete effectively against potential competitors, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer.\nWe believe that our ability to successfully compete in the rare disease category will depend in part on our ability to obtain Orphan Drug designation for our product candidates to treat rare diseases as well as:\n\u2022\nour ability to design and successfully execute appropriate clinical trials\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit and enroll patients for our clinical trials\n\u2022\nthe results of our clinical trials and the efficacy and safety of our product candidates\n\u2022\nthe speed at which we develop our product candidates\n\u2022\nachieving and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements applicable to our business\n\u2022\nthe timing and scope of regulatory approvals, including labeling\n\u2022\nadequate levels of reimbursement under private and governmental health insurance plans, including Medicare and Medicaid\n\u2022\nour ability to protect intellectual property rights related to our product candidates\n\u2022\nour ability to commercialize and market any of our product candidates that may receive marketing approval\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture and sell commercial quantities of any approved product candidates to the market\n\u2022\nacceptance of our product candidates by physicians, other healthcare providers and patients\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative therapies\nIf our competitors are able to obtain Orphan Drug exclusivity for their products that are the same drug as our product candidates, we may not be able to have competing products approved by the applicable regulatory authority for a significant period of time or benefit from that exclusivity.\nWe have Orphan Drug exclusivity designation in the U.S. for ACER-001 for MSUD and EDSIVOTM for vEDS. We expect to seek Orphan Drug exclusivity from the EMA for ACER-001 for MSUD; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful. If we are unable to maintain our current Orphan Drug exclusivity or are unable to secure orphan status in Europe for ACER-001 for MSUD, it may have a material negative effect on our business.\nGenerally, if a product with an Orphan Drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, that product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the applicable regulatory authority from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for that time period. The applicable period is seven years in the U.S. and ten years in the EU. The exclusivity period in the EU can be reduced to six years if the product no longer meets the criteria for Orphan Drug designation or if its commercialization is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan Drug exclusivity may be lost if FDA or the EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to ensure sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Maintaining and/or obtaining Orphan Drug exclusivity for ACER-001 and EDSIVOTM may be important to the product candidate\u2019s success. Even if we obtain Orphan Drug exclusivity, we may not be able to maintain it. For example, if a competitive product that treats the same disease as our product candidate is shown to be clinically superior to our product candidate, any Orphan Drug exclusivity we have obtained will not block the approval of such competitive product and we may effectively lose what had previously been Orphan Drug exclusivity. Orphan Drug exclusivity for ACER-001 or EDSIVOTM also will not bar FDA from approving another celiprolol drug product or a sodium phenylbutyrate (\u201cNaPB\u201d) product, for another indication. In the U.S., reforms to the Orphan Drug Act, if enacted, could also materially affect our ability to maintain Orphan Drug exclusivity for ACER-001 for MSUD and EDSIVOTM for vEDS.\nPrice controls, importation of drug products from outside the U.S., or other rules may be imposed in domestic or foreign markets, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nThe U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs and drug prices in general, including for therapies for rare diseases. These measures include price controls, transparency requirements triggered by the introduction of new high-cost drugs into the market, drug re-importation, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Some laws and regulations have already been enacted in these areas, and additional measures have been introduced or are under consideration at both the federal and state levels. Additionally, legislation that affects reimbursement for drugs with small patient populations could be adopted, limiting payments for pharmaceuticals such as our product candidates, which could adversely affect our potential future net revenue and results. Adoption of such controls and measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as our drug product candidates and could adversely affect our net revenue and results.\nIn some countries, particularly member states of the EU, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There is also the potential for a reference pricing system using drug prices from other countries, sometimes referred to as \u201cmost favored nation\u201d treatment. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be adversely affected.\nRapid technological change could make our product candidates obsolete.\nPharmaceutical technologies have undergone rapid and significant change, and we expect that they will continue to do so. As a result, there is significant risk that our product candidates may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by new discoveries before we recover all or any expenses incurred in connection with their development. If any of our product candidates are rendered obsolete by advancements in pharmaceutical technologies, our business will suffer.\nGovernment controls and healthcare reform measures could adversely affect our business.\nThe business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are affected by the efforts of governmental and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare. In the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the healthcare system. For example, in some foreign countries, particularly in Europe, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of any product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of any product candidate is unavailable or limited in scope or amount in a particular country, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability in such country. In the U.S., the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (\u201cMMA\u201d) changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation established Medicare Part D, which expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drug purchases by the elderly but provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. The MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. Any negotiated prices\nfor any product candidate covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices that might otherwise be obtained outside of the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. Moreover, while Medicare Part D applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment under Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.\nThe U.S. and several other jurisdictions are considering, or have already enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell any product candidate. Among policy-makers and payors in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access to healthcare. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives and executive actions. There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and executive regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect: the demand for any product candidate; the ability to set a price that we believe is fair for any product candidate; our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; the level of taxes that we are required to pay; and the availability of capital.\nRisks Related to Third Parties\nWe rely on third-party suppliers and other third parties for manufacture of our product candidates and our dependence on these third parties may impair or delay the advancement of our research and development programs and the development of our product candidates.\nWe do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of our product candidates. We lack the resources and the capability to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. Instead, we rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, third parties for the supply of raw materials and manufacture of drug supplies necessary to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Our reliance on third parties may expose us to more risk than if we were to manufacture our current product candidates or other products ourselves. Delays in production by third parties could delay our clinical trials or have an adverse impact on any commercial activities. In addition, the fact that we are dependent on third parties for the manufacture of and formulation of our product candidates means that we are subject to the risk that the products may have manufacturing defects that we have limited ability to prevent or control. Although we oversee these activities to ensure compliance with our quality standards, budgets and timelines, we have had and will continue to have less control over the manufacturing of our product candidates than potentially would be the case if we were to manufacture our product candidates. Further, due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other reasons, the third parties we deal with could have staffing difficulties, might undergo changes in priorities or may become financially distressed, which would adversely affect the manufacturing and production of our product candidates. In addition, a third party could be acquired by, or enter into an exclusive arrangement with, one of our competitors, which would adversely affect our ability to access the formulations we require.\nThe facilities used by our current contract manufacturers and any future manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must be inspected by FDA after we submit our NDA for a product candidate. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturers for compliance with the regulatory requirements, known as cGMPs, for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of FDA or others, FDA may refuse to approve our NDA. If FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve our NDA because of concerns about the manufacture of our product candidates or if significant manufacturing issues arise in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop our product candidates, to obtain marketing approval of our NDA or to continue to market our product candidates, if approved. Although we are ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with these regulatory requirements, we do not have day-to-day control over a contract manufacturing organization (\u201cCMO\u201d) or other third-party manufacturer\u2019s compliance with\napplicable laws and regulations, including cGMPs and other laws and regulations, such as those related to environmental health and safety matters. Any failure to achieve and maintain compliance with these laws, regulations and standards could subject us to the risk that we may have to suspend the manufacturing of our product candidates or that obtained approvals could be revoked, which would adversely affect our business and reputation. In addition, third-party contractors, such as our CMOs, may elect not to continue to work with us due to factors beyond our control. Although we have contracts in place, they may also refuse to work with us because of their own financial difficulties, business priorities or other reasons, at a time that is costly or otherwise inconvenient for us. If we were unable to find adequate replacement or another acceptable solution in time, our clinical trials could be delayed or our commercial activities could be harmed.\nProblems with the quality of the work of third parties may lead us to seek to terminate our working relationships and use alternative service providers. However, making this change may be costly and may delay clinical trials. In addition, it may be very challenging, and in some cases impossible, to find replacement service providers that can develop and manufacture our drug candidates in an acceptable manner and at an acceptable cost and on a timely basis. The sale of products containing any defects or any delays in the supply of necessary services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nGrowth in the costs and expenses of components or raw materials may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Supply sources could be interrupted from time to time and, if interrupted, supplies may not be resumed (whether in part or in whole) within a reasonable timeframe and at an acceptable cost or at all.\nWe plan to rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, it may cause delays in commencing and completing clinical trials of our product candidates or we may be unable to obtain marketing approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nClinical trials must meet applicable FDA and foreign regulatory requirements. We do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials for any of our product candidates. We have and will continue to rely on third parties, such as CROs, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to conduct all of our clinical trials of our product candidates; however, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with our investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with IND and human subject protection regulations and current good clinical practice standards, commonly referred to as GCPs, for conducting, monitoring, recording, and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our third-party contractors fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. There is no assurance that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCPs. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the marketing approval process.\nThere are significant requirements imposed on us and on clinical investigators who conduct clinical trials that we sponsor. Although we are responsible for selecting qualified CROs or clinical investigators, providing them with the information they need to conduct the clinical trials properly, ensuring proper monitoring of the clinical trials, and ensuring that the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols contained in the IND, we cannot ensure that the CROs or clinical investigators will maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements at all times. The pharmaceutical industry has experienced cases where clinical investigators have been found to incorrectly record data, omit data, or even falsify data. We cannot ensure that the CROs or clinical investigators in our trials will not make mistakes or otherwise compromise the integrity or validity of data, any of which would have a significant negative effect on our ability to obtain marketing approval, our business, and our financial condition.\nWe or the third parties we rely on may encounter problems in clinical trials that may cause us or FDA or foreign regulatory agencies to delay, suspend or terminate our clinical trials at any phase. These problems could include the possibility that we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials for use in our clinical trials, conduct clinical trials at our preferred sites, enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials at one or more sites, or begin or successfully complete clinical trials in a timely fashion, if at all. Furthermore, we, FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may suspend clinical trials of our product candidates at any time if we or they believe the subjects participating in the trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, whether as a result of adverse events occurring in our trials or otherwise, or if we or they find deficiencies in the clinical trial process or conduct of the investigation.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory agencies could also require additional clinical trials before or after granting of marketing approval for any products, which would result in increased costs and significant delays in the development and commercialization of such products and could result in the withdrawal of such products from the market after obtaining marketing approval. Our failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product candidate in clinical development could delay or prevent obtaining marketing approval of the product candidate and, after obtaining marketing approval, data from post-approval studies could result in the product being withdrawn from the market, either of which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, the above risks are compounded by uncertainties related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which could affect our CROs\u2019 businesses internally (for example, maintaining staffing levels and ongoing financial viability), as well as their ability to perform their obligations to us under our agreements (such as recruitment of subjects for clinical trials in an increasingly uncertain and competitive business environment).\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies and product candidates.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and protect our existing patent position as well as our ability to maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our technologies, product candidates, and any future products in the U.S. and other countries. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as U.S. laws, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our proprietary rights in these countries. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies, product candidates and any future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.\nWe apply for patents covering both our technologies and product candidates, as we deem appropriate. However, we may fail to apply for patents on important technologies or product candidates in a timely fashion, or at all. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products and technologies. We cannot be certain that our patent applications will be approved or that any patents issued will adequately protect our intellectual property.\nWhile we are responsible for and typically have control over the filing and prosecuting of patent applications and maintaining patents which cover making, using or selling ACER-001, ACER-801, EDSIVOTM, or ACER-2820, we may lose any such rights if we decide to allow any licensed patent to lapse. If we fail to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for any of our product candidates, our ability to develop and commercialize those product candidates may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products.\nMoreover, the patent positions of pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are evolving and remain unresolved. As a result, the validity and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, we do not know whether:\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for these inventions\n\u2022\nany of the patents that cover our product candidates will be eligible to be listed in FDA\u2019s compendium of \u201cApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluation,\u201d sometimes referred to as FDA\u2019s Orange Book\n\u2022\nothers will independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies\n\u2022\nany of our or our licensors\u2019 pending patent applications will result in issued patents\n\u2022\nany of our or our licensors\u2019 patents will be valid or enforceable\n\u2022\nany patents issued to us or our licensors and collaborators will provide us with any competitive advantages, or will be challenged by third parties\n\u2022\nwe will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable\n\u2022\nthe U.S. government will exercise any of its statutory rights to our intellectual property that was developed with government funding\n\u2022\nour business may infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others\nThe actual protection afforded by a patent varies based on products or processes, from country to country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, the validity and enforceability of the patents and our financial ability to enforce our patents and other intellectual property. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our products will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products. Due to the extensive amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.\nWe may also rely on trade secrets to protect some of our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to maintain. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, we or any of our collaborators\u2019 employees, consultants, contractors or scientific and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information to competitors and we may not have adequate remedies in respect of that disclosure. Enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade secrets is expensive, time consuming and uncertain. In addition, foreign courts are sometimes less willing than U.S. courts to protect trade secrets. If our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, we would not be able to assert our trade secrets against them and our business could be harmed.\nWe are a party to license or similar agreements under which we license intellectual property, data, and/or receive commercialization rights relating to ACER-001, ACER-801, EDSIVOTM, and ACER-2820. If we fail to comply with obligations in such agreements or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose license rights that are important to our business; any termination of such agreements would adversely affect our business.\nIn April 2014, we entered into an agreement with Baylor College of Medicine pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize NaPB (ACER-001) for treatment of MSUD. In August 2016, we entered into an agreement with Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, H\u00f4pital Europ\u00e9en Georges Pompidou (\u201cAP-HP\u201d), pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide right to access and use data from the Ong trial, which we used to support an NDA filing for EDSIVOTM for the treatment of vEDS. In September 2018, we entered into an additional agreement with AP-HP pursuant to which we obtained the exclusive worldwide intellectual property rights to three European patent applications relating to certain uses of celiprolol including (i) the optimal dose of celiprolol in treating vEDS patients, (ii) the use of celiprolol during pregnancy and (iii) the use of celiprolol to treat kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type VI). In December 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Sanofi granting us worldwide rights to ACER-801, a clinical-stage, selective, non-peptide tachykinin NK3 receptor antagonist. Under each license agreement, we are subject to commercialization and development diligence obligations, royalty payments and other obligations. If we fail to comply with any of these obligations or otherwise breach any of these license agreements, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license in whole or in part or to terminate the exclusive nature of the license. The loss of the licenses granted to us under our agreements with these licensors or the rights provided therein would prevent us from developing, manufacturing or marketing products covered by the license or subject to supply commitments, and could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the U.S. can be less extensive than those in the U.S. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the U.S. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the U.S., or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the U.S. or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement rights are not as strong as those in the U.S. These products may compete with our product candidates in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nThe patent protection for our product candidates may expire before we are able to maximize their commercial value, which may subject us to increased competition and reduce or eliminate our opportunity to generate product revenue.\nThe patents for our product candidates have varying expiration dates and, if these patents expire, we may be subject to increased competition and we may not be able to recover our development costs or market any of our approved products profitably. In some of the larger potential market territories, such as the U.S. and Europe, patent term extension or restoration may be available to compensate for time taken during aspects of the product\u2019s development and regulatory review. For example, depending on the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, if any, one of the U.S. patents covering each of such approved product(s) or the use thereof may be eligible for up to five years of patent term restoration under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows a maximum of one patent to be extended per FDA-approved product. Patent term extension also may be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nNevertheless, we may not be granted patent term extension either in the U.S. or in any foreign country because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the term of extension, as well as the scope of patent protection during any such extension, afforded by the governmental authority could be less than we request. In addition, even though some regulatory authorities may provide some other exclusivity for a product under their own laws and regulations, we may not be able to qualify the product or obtain the exclusive time period. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension/restoration or some other exclusivity, we could be subject to increased competition and our opportunity to establish or maintain product revenue could be substantially reduced or eliminated. Furthermore, we may not have sufficient time to recover our development costs prior to the expiration of our U.S. and foreign patents.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent prosecution process. Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on any issued patent and/or pending patent applications are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of a patent or patent application. We employ an outside firm and rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees. While an inadvertent lapse may sometimes be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are many situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications directed to our product candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than should otherwise have been the case, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect our patents or other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time-consuming and ultimately unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, directly or through our licensors, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of our licensor is not valid or is unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of the patents we license at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our licensors\u2019 patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nInterference proceedings brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or the patents of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if a prevailing party does not offer us a license on terms that are acceptable to us. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distraction of our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the U.S. In addition, potential infringers of our intellectual property rights may have substantially more resources than we do to defend their position, which could adversely affect the outcome of any such dispute.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential and proprietary information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation may adversely affect our business and could prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates.\nOur commercial success depends in part on us not infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the U.S., involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions, ex-parte review and inter partes reexamination and post-grant review proceedings before the USPTO and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing and may develop our product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. If a third party claims that we infringe on their products or technology, we could face a number of issues, including:\n\u2022\ninfringement and other intellectual property claims which, with or without merit, can be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and can divert management\u2019s attention from our core business\n\u2022\nsubstantial damages for past infringement, which we may have to pay if a court decides that our product infringes on a competitor\u2019s patent\n\u2022\na court prohibiting us from selling or licensing our product unless the patent holder licenses the patent to us, which the collaborator would not be required to do\n\u2022\nif a license is available from a patent holder, we may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patents\n\u2022\nredesigning our processes so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates that we failed to identify. For example, applications filed before November 29, 2000 and certain applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the U.S. remain confidential until issued as patents. Except for the preceding exceptions, patent applications in the U.S. and elsewhere are generally published only after a waiting period of approximately 18 months after the earliest filing. Therefore, patent applications covering our product candidates could have been filed by others without the knowledge of us or our licensors. Additionally, pending patent applications which have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our product candidates or the use or manufacture of our product candidates. We may also face a claim of misappropriation if a third party believes that we inappropriately obtained and used trade secrets of such third party. If we are found to have misappropriated a third party\u2019s trade secrets, we may be prevented from further using such trade secrets, limiting our ability to develop our product candidates, and we may be required to pay damages.\nIf any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment, the holders of any such patents would be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate until such patent expired or unless we obtain a license. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property.\nUltimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defending against claims of patent infringement or misappropriation of trade secrets could be costly and time-consuming, regardless of the outcome. Thus, even if we were to ultimately prevail, or to settle at an early stage, such litigation could burden us with substantial unanticipated costs. In addition, litigation or threatened litigation could result in significant demands on the time and attention of our management team, distracting them from the pursuit of other company business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into development collaborations that would help us bring our product candidates to market.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.\nAs is the case with other pharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly on obtaining and enforcing patents and patent rights. Obtaining and enforcing patents and patent rights in the specialty pharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity, and therefore, is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the U.S. has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Further, several recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have either narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents and patent rights, once obtained.\nFor our U.S. patent applications containing a claim not entitled to priority before March 16, 2013, there is a greater level of uncertainty in the patent law. In September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \u201cAmerica Invents Act\u201d or \u201cAIA\u201d) was signed into law. The AIA includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted, reviewed after issuance, and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO is currently developing regulations and procedures to govern administration of the AIA, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the AIA. It is not clear what other, if any, impact the AIA will have on the operation of our business. Moreover, the AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of patent rights, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nAn important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the U.S. transitioned to a \u201cfirst-inventor-to-file\u201d system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after that date but before the filing of a patent application by a licensor or us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if said licensor or we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Furthermore, our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patent rights depends on whether the differences between the licensor\u2019s or our technology and the prior art allow our technology to be patentable over the\nprior art. Since patent applications in the U.S. and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that a licensor or we were the first to either (a) file any patent application related to our product candidates or (b) invent any of the inventions claimed in our patents or patent applications.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S. federal court necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid as unpatentable even though the same evidence may be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate patent rights that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action.\nDepending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nIntellectual property rights do not address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022\nOthers may be able to make products that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we license from others or may license or own in the future\n\u2022\nOthers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or otherwise circumvent any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights\n\u2022\nAny of our collaborators might not have been the first to conceive and reduce to practice the inventions covered by the patents or patent applications that we license or will, in the future, own or license\n\u2022\nAny of our collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of the patents or patent applications that we license or will, in the future, license\n\u2022\nIssued patents that have been licensed to us may not provide us with any competitive advantage, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors\n\u2022\nOur competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have license rights, or in countries where research and development safe harbor laws exist, and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets\n\u2022\nOwnership of patents or patent applications licensed to us may be challenged by third parties\n\u2022\nThe patents of third parties or pending or future applications of third parties, if issued, may have an adverse effect on our business\nConfidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and protect other proprietary information.\nWe consider proprietary trade secrets and/or confidential know-how and unpatented know-how to be important to our business. We may rely on trade secrets and/or confidential know-how to protect our technology, especially where patent protection is believed by us to be of limited value. However, trade secrets and/or confidential know-how can be difficult to maintain as confidential.\nTo protect this type of information against disclosure or appropriation by competitors, our policy is to require our employees, consultants, contractors and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements with us. However, current or former employees, consultants, contractors and advisers may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors, and confidentiality agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Enforcing a claim that a third party obtained illegally and is using trade secrets and/or confidential know-how is expensive, time consuming and unpredictable. The enforceability of confidentiality agreements may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nFailure to obtain or maintain trade secrets and/or confidential know-how trade protection could adversely affect our competitive position. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and may even apply for patent protection in respect of the same. If successful in obtaining such patent protection, our competitors could limit our use of our trade secrets and/or confidential know-how.\nWe may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our product candidates, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could materially harm our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe have received confidential and proprietary information from third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise improperly used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers.\nFurther, we may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. We may also be subject to claims that former employees, consultants, independent contractors, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging our right to and use of confidential and proprietary information. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose our rights therein. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEven if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents and other intellectual property. We may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nOur reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nBecause we rely on third parties to assist with research and development and to manufacture our product candidates, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, these agreements typically restrict the ability of our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants to publish data potentially relating to our trade secrets, although our agreements may contain certain limited publication rights. For example, any academic institution that we may collaborate with in the future will usually expect to be granted rights to publish data arising out of such collaboration, provided that we are notified in advance and given the opportunity to delay publication for a limited time period in order for us to secure patent protection of intellectual property rights arising from the collaboration, in addition to the opportunity to remove confidential or trade secret information from any such publication. In the future we may also conduct joint research and development programs that may require us to share trade secrets under the terms of our research and development or similar agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, our competitors may discover our trade secrets, either through breach of our agreements with third parties, independent development or publication of information by any of our third-party collaborators. A competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and have an adverse impact on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nOur share price is very volatile, may not reflect the underlying value of our net assets or business prospects, and you may not be able to resell your shares at a profit or at all.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations. The market prices for securities of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and early-stage drug discovery and development companies like ours in particular, have historically been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant changes in our business or operations\n\u2022\nthe development status of any of our drug candidates, including clinical study results and determinations by regulatory authorities with respect thereto, including but not limited to (i) ACER-001 for which we received FDA\u2019s acceptance for filing and substantive review of our NDA in October 2021, and (ii) any continued development of EDSIVOTM that we may or may not decide to pursue in light of FDA\u2019s March 2020 denial of our appeal of the June 2019 Complete Response Letter and our plan to conduct a pivotal clinical trial in patients with COL3A1+ vEDS\n\u2022\nthe initiation, termination or reduction in the scope of any collaboration arrangements or any disputes or developments regarding such collaborations\n\u2022\nmarket conditions\n\u2022\nthe impact of short selling or the impact of a potential \u201cshort squeeze\u201d resulting from a sudden increase in demand for our stock\n\u2022\nour capital and our inability to obtain additional funding\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new commercial products, or other material events by our competitors or by us\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments concerning our proprietary rights\n\u2022\nchanges in, or failure to meet, securities analysts\u2019 or investors\u2019 expectations of our financial performance\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel\n\u2022\ndiscussions of our business, products, financial performance, prospects or stock price by the financial and scientific press and online investor communities\n\u2022\npublic concern as to, and legislative action with respect to, the pricing and availability of prescription drugs or the safety of drugs and drug delivery techniques\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the U.S. and in foreign countries\n\u2022\ndilutive effects of sales of shares of common stock by us or our stockholders, and sales of common stock acquired upon exercise by the holders of options\n\u2022\nour ability to sell shares of common stock to Lincoln Park pursuant to the terms of the equity line purchase agreement and our ability to register and maintain the registration of the shares issued and issuable thereunder\nBroad market and industry factors, as well as economic and political factors, also may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As noted, the short-, medium-, and long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. and global economies generally, and on our business specifically, are difficult to predict.\nWe may not comply with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements. If we are unable to regain and maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock could be delisted, which could affect our common stock's market price and liquidity and reduce our ability to raise capital.\nThe Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s continued listing standards for our common stock require, among other things, that we maintain either (i) stockholders\u2019 equity of $2.5 million, (ii) market value of listed securities of $35 million or (iii) net income from continuing operations of $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the last three most recently completed fiscal years. On December 29, 2021, we received a letter from the listing qualifications department staff of Nasdaq indicating that for the last 30 consecutive business days our minimum Market Value of Listed Securities (\u201cMVLS\u201d) was below the $35 million required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq listing rule 5550(b)(2). Our stockholder\u2019s equity and net income from continuing operations were also below the alternate listing standards levels at that time and at December 31, 2021. In accordance with Nasdaq listing rules, we have 180 calendar days, or until June 27, 2022, to regain compliance. We cannot assure you that we will be able to regain and maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing standards. Our failure to meet or continue to meet these requirements may result in our common stock being delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market. If our common stock were delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, among other things, this could result in a number of negative implications, including reduced market price and liquidity of our common stock as a result of the loss of market efficiencies associated with the Nasdaq, the loss of federal preemption of state securities laws, as well as the potential loss of confidence by suppliers, partners, employees and institutional investor interest, fewer business development opportunities, greater difficulty in obtaining financing and breaches of certain contractual obligations.\nWe have been a defendant in securities litigation in the past and may become the target of securities litigation in the future, which may be costly and time-consuming to defend.\nFollowing periods of market volatility in the price of a company\u2019s securities or the reporting of unfavorable news, security holders have often instituted class action litigation. This risk is especially relevant for us because pharmaceutical companies like ours have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. Moreover, we\nwere named in a putative securities class action complaint and several stockholder derivative actions as a result of the decline in our stock price following the June 25, 2019 announcement that we had received a Complete Response Letter from FDA regarding our NDA for EDSIVO\u2122. See Part I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings for additional information regarding the settlement of these matters. If we become involved in this type of litigation in the future, regardless of the outcome, we could incur substantial legal costs and our management\u2019s attention could be diverted from the operation of our business, causing our business to suffer.\nOur \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock could be issued to prevent a business combination not desired by management or our majority stockholders.\nOur charter authorizes the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined by our Board of Directors without stockholder approval. Our preferred stock could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a change in control and as a method of preventing stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares in connection with a change of control.\nFuture sales of our common stock could cause dilution, and the sale of such common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our stock to decline.\nSales of additional shares of our common stock, as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. An aggregate of 14,310,244 shares of common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2021. As of such date, another 1,954,975 shares of common stock were issuable upon exercise of outstanding options. A substantial majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, as well as a substantial majority of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options, are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933.\nWe may sell additional shares of common stock, as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, in subsequent public or private offerings. We may also issue additional shares of common stock, as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, to finance future acquisitions. We will need to raise additional capital in order to initiate or complete additional development activities for all of our product candidates or to pursue additional disease indications for our product candidates, and this may require us to issue a substantial amount of securities (including common stock as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock). There can be no assurance that our capital raising efforts will be able to attract the capital needed to execute on our business plan and sustain our operations. Moreover, we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock, as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our securities will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, including shares issued in connection with an acquisition or securing funds to complete any clinical trial plans, or the perception that such sales could occur, may result in substantial dilution and may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nOn April 30, 2020, we entered into the equity line purchase agreement with Lincoln Park, pursuant to which Lincoln Park has committed to purchase up to $15.0 million of our common stock, with $12.1 million obligation remaining as of December 31, 2021. Upon the execution of the purchase agreement, we issued 148,148 commitment shares to Lincoln Park as consideration for its commitment to purchase shares of our common stock under the purchase agreement. The remaining shares of our common stock that may be issued under the purchase agreement may be sold by us to Lincoln Park at our discretion from time to time over a 36-month period commencing on June 8, 2020. The purchase price for the shares that we may sell to Lincoln Park under the purchase agreement will fluctuate based on the price of our common stock. Depending on market liquidity at the time, sales of such shares may cause the trading price of our common stock to fall. Subsequent to signing the purchase agreement through the date of this report, we have sold an aggregate of 1,100,000 shares of common stock under the purchase agreement for net proceeds of $2.6 million.\nWe generally have the right to control the timing and amount of any sales of our shares to Lincoln Park under the purchase agreement. Sales of our common stock to Lincoln Park under the purchase agreement will depend upon market conditions and other factors to be determined by us. We may ultimately decide to sell to Lincoln Park all or\nonly some of the shares of our common stock that may be available for us to sell pursuant to the purchase agreement. If and when we do sell additional shares to Lincoln Park, after Lincoln Park has acquired the shares, Lincoln Park may resell all, some or none of those shares at any time or from time to time in its discretion. Therefore, sales to Lincoln Park by us could result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park, or the anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.\nWe presently do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe currently anticipate that no cash dividends will be paid on our common stock in the foreseeable future. While our dividend policy will be based on the operating results and capital needs of the business, it is anticipated that all earnings, if any, will be retained to finance the future expansion of our business.\nWe may issue debt and equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, any of which may be senior to our common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by entering into debt or debt-like financing that is unsecured or secured by up to all of our assets, or by issuing additional debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of secured or unsecured commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior notes, subordinated notes, guarantees, preferred stock, hybrid securities, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities. In the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt and preferred securities would receive distributions of available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock. Because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in future offerings may be influenced by market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings or debt financings. Further, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future.\nBecause a prior year merger resulted in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, our pre-merger net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes will be subject to limitation or elimination. The net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes of our former wholly-owned subsidiary may also be subject to limitations as a result of ownership changes.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u2018\u2018ownership change,\u2019\u2019 the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u2018\u2018ownership change\u2019\u2019 generally occurs if there is a cumulative change in a company\u2019s ownership by \u2018\u2018five-percent shareholders\u2019\u2019 that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We experienced an ownership change on July 17, 2015 and August 3, 2018, and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of this issuance or future transactions in our stock, some of which may be outside our control. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or other pre-change tax attributes, to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income and taxes may be subject to significant limitations..\nBecause of their ownership of our common stock, insiders may influence significant corporate decisions.\nAs of February 15, 2022, our executive officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially owned or controlled 15% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, these executive officers, directors and their affiliates will have substantial influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change of control of our company, even if such a change of control would benefit our other stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law might discourage, delay, or prevent an acquisition attempt or change in control of our company that you might consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control of our company. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize the Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, blank-check preferred stock that, if issued, could operate as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that is not approved by the Board of Directors\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of directors and for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings\n\u2022\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings\n\u2022\nrequire that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum\n\u2022\nrequire a super-majority of votes to approve certain amendments to our charter as well as to amend our bylaws generally\n\u2022\nauthorize us to indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in investigations and legal proceedings resulting from their services to us, which may include services in connection with takeover defense measures\nFurther, as a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law regulating corporate takeovers. Section 203 generally prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with interested stockholders subject to certain exceptions.\nThese anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law, our charter and our bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving an acquisition attempt or a change in control of our company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the stockholder believes is more convenient or favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u2022\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine\nSection 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities\nAct or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or any other claim for which the federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the stockholder believes is more convenient or favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 91471, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ACER"}
