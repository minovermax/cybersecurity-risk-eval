{"cik": "849636", "company": "RespireRx Pharmaceuticals Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-04-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our continuing operations and the price of our common stock are subject to the following risks:\nRisks related to our business\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn its audit opinion issued in connection with our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern given our limited working capital, recurring net losses and negative cash flows from operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence. While we have relied principally in the past on external financing to provide liquidity and capital resources for our operations, we can provide no assurance that cash generated from our operations together with cash received in the future from external financing, if any, will be sufficient to enable us to continue as a going concern.\nWe have a history of net losses; we expect to continue to incur net losses and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nSince our formation on February 10, 1987 through the end of our most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, we have generated only minimal operating revenues. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, our net loss was $2,115,033 and as of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $166,509,085. We have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and it is possible that we will never generate revenues from product sales in the future. Even if we do achieve significant revenues from product sales, we expect to continue to incur significant net losses over the next several years. As with other biotechnology companies, it is possible that we will never achieve profitable operations.\nWe will need additional capital in the near term and the future and, if such capital is not available on terms acceptable to us or available to us at all, we may need to scale back our research and development efforts and may be unable to continue our business operations.\nWe require additional cash resources for basic operations and will require substantial additional funds to advance our research and development programs and to continue our operations, particularly if we decide to independently conduct later-stage clinical testing and apply for regulatory approval of any of our proposed products, and if we decide to independently undertake the marketing and promotion of our products. Additionally, we may require additional funds in the event that we decide to pursue strategic acquisitions of or licenses for other products or businesses. Based on our operating plan as of December 31, 2019, we estimated that our existing cash resources will not be sufficient to meet our requirements for 2020. We also need additional capital in the near term to fund on-going operations including basic operations. Additional funds may come from the sale of common equity, preferred equity, convertible preferred equity or equity-linked securities, debt, including debt convertible into equity, or may result from agreements with larger pharmaceutical companies that include the license or rights to the technologies and products that we are currently developing, although there is no assurance that we will secure any such funding or other transaction in a timely manner, or at all.\nOur cash requirements in the future may differ significantly from our current estimates, depending on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf Our ability to raise equity or debt capital, or our ability to obtain in-kind services which may be more difficult during the current pandemic health crisis;\n\u25cf the results of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf the costs of setting up and operating our own marketing and sales organization;\n\u25cf the ability to obtain funding under contractual and licensing agreements;\n\u25cf the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents or any litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property;\n\u25cf the costs involved in meeting our contractual obligations including employment agreements; and\n\u25cf our success in entering into collaborative relationships with other parties.\nTo finance our future activities, we may seek funds through additional rounds of financing, including private or public equity or debt offerings and collaborative arrangements with corporate partners. We may also seek to exchange or restructure some of our outstanding securities to provide liquidity, strengthen our balance sheet and provide flexibility. We cannot say with any certainty that these measures will be successful, or that we will be able to obtain the additional needed funds on reasonable terms, or at all. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional and possibly substantial dilution to our stockholders. If we issued preferred equity or debt securities, these securities could have rights superior to holders of our common stock, and such instruments entered into in connection with the issuance of securities could contain covenants that will restrict our operations. We might have to obtain funds or in-kind services through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies, product candidates or products that we otherwise would not relinquish. If adequate funds are not available in the future, as required, we could lose our key employees and might have to further delay, scale back or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs, which would impair our future prospects. In addition, we may be unable to meet our research spending obligations under our existing licensing agreements and may be unable to continue our business operations.\nOur product opportunities rely on licenses from research institutions and if we lose access to these technologies or applications, our business could be substantially impaired.\nThrough the merger with Pier, the Company gained access to a 2007 Exclusive License Agreement (as amended, the \u201c2007 License Agreement\u201d), that Pier had entered into with UIC on October 10, 2007. The 2007 License Agreement covered certain patents and patent applications in the United States and other countries claiming the use of certain compounds referred to as cannabinoids for the treatment of sleep related breathing disorders (including sleep apnea), of which dronabinol is a specific example of one type of cannabinoid. Dronabinol is a synthetic derivative of the naturally occurring substance in the cannabis plant, otherwise known as \u03949-THC (\u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol). Dronabinol is currently approved by the FDA and is sold generically for use in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, as well as for anorexia in patients with AIDS. Pier\u2019s business plan was to determine whether dronabinol would significantly improve subjective and objective clinical measures in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. In addition, Pier intended to evaluate the feasibility and comparative efficacy of a proprietary formulation of dronabinol. The 2007 License Agreement was terminated effective March 21, 2013 due to the Company\u2019s failure to make a required payment and on June 27, 2014, the Company entered into the 2014 License Agreement with UIC that was similar, but not identical, to the 2007 License Agreement that had been terminated. If we are unable to comply with the terms of the 2014 License Agreement, such as required payments thereunder, the 2014 License Agreement might be terminated.\nOn May 9, 2007, the Company entered into a license agreement with The Governors of the University of Alberta, as subsequently amended, granting he Company exclusive rights to practice patents held by the University of Alberta claiming the use of ampakines for the treatment of various respiratory disorders. By letter dated May 18, 2018, the Company received notice from counsel claiming to represent TEC Edmonton and The Governors of the University of Alberta, which purports to terminate, effective December 12, 2017, the license agreement dated May 9, 2007 between the Company and The Governors of the University of Alberta. The Company, through its counsel, disputed any grounds for termination and notified the representative that it invoked Section 13 of that license agreement, which mandates a meeting to be attended by individuals with decision-making authority to attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution to the dispute. In February 2019, the Company and TEC Edmonton, in February 2019, tentatively agreed to terms acceptable to all parties to establish a new license agreement and the form of a new license agreement. However, after reaching that tentative agreement, the Company re-evaluated that portion of its ampakine program and has decided not to enter into a new agreement at this time. The lack of entry into a new agreement at this time does not affect the Company\u2019s other ampakine programs and permits the Company to reallocate resources to those programs, including, but not limited to ADHD, SCI, FXS and CNS-driven disorders.\nWe may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize our proposed products and technologies.\nThe development of cannabinoid products and ampakine products is subject to the risks of failure commonly experienced in the development of products based upon innovative technologies and the expense and difficulty of obtaining approvals from regulatory agencies. Drug discovery and development is time consuming, expensive and unpredictable. On average, only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine. All of our proposed products are in the preclinical or early to mid-clinical stage of development and will require significant additional funding for research, development and clinical testing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all, before we are able to submit them to any of the regulatory agencies for clearances for commercial use.\nThe process from discovery to development to regulatory approval can take several years and drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process. Late stage clinical trials often fail to replicate results achieved in earlier studies. In a recent study (in the journal BioStatistics, Volume 20, Issue 2, April 2019, pp 273-286) covering approximately 16 years of clinical trial data (both company sponsored clinical trials and non-company sponsored trials), the authors showed transitional success rates from Phase 1 to Phase 2 of 66.4% (failure rate of 33.6%), from Phase 2 to Phase 3 of 58.3% (failure rate of 41.7%) and from Phase 3 to approval of 59.0% (failure rate of 41%). Other studies have shown lower success and higher failure rates. We cannot assure you that we will be able to complete successfully any of our research and development activities including those described above under PART I. Item 1. Business - Development Goals.\nEven if we do complete them, we may not be able to market successfully any of the products or be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or assure that healthcare providers and payors will accept our products. We also face the risk that any or all of our products will not work as intended or that they will be unsafe, or that, even if they do work and are safe, that our products will be uneconomical to manufacture and market on a large scale. Due to the extended testing and regulatory review process required before we can obtain marketing clearance, we do not expect to be able to commercialize any therapeutic drug for several years, either directly or through our corporate partners or licensees.\nCOVID-19 pandemic may affect our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our proposed products and technologies.\nThe recent COVID-19 pandemic has made it very difficult to recruit subjects and patients and to conduct clinical trials in general. Given the public health emergency during the winter and spring of 2020, the FDA issued guidance to be implemented without the normal prior public comment period as the FDA had concluded that public participation would not be feasible or appropriate. Guidance is not legally enforceable, but the FDA recommends following its guidance. Challenges are expected to arise from quarantines, site closures, travel limitations, interruptions to the supply chain for investigational products, or other considerations if site personnel or trial subjects become infected with COVID-19. These challenges may lead to difficulties in meeting protocol-specified procedures. The FDA emphasized that safety of trial participants is critically important. Decisions to continue or discontinue individual patients or the trial are expected to be made by trial sponsors in consultation with clinical investors and Institutional Review Boards. COVID-19 screening procedures may need to be implemented. As challenging as the clinical trial process is during normal times, the risks, strategic and operational challenges and the costs of conducting such trials has increased substantially during the pandemic.\nWe may not be able to enter into the strategic alliances necessary to fully develop and commercialize our products and technologies, and we will be dependent on our strategic partners if we do.\nWe are seeking pharmaceutical company and other strategic partners to participate with us in the development of major indications for the cannabinoids and neuromodulator compounds. These agreements would potentially provide us with additional funds or in-kind services in exchange for exclusive or non-exclusive license or other rights to the technologies and products that we are currently developing. Competition between biopharmaceutical companies for these types of arrangements is intense. We cannot give any assurance that our discussions with candidate companies will result in an agreement or agreements in a timely manner, or at all. Additionally, we cannot assure you that any resulting agreement will generate sufficient revenues to offset our operating expenses and longer-term funding requirements.\nIf our third-party manufacturers\u2019 facilities do not follow current good manufacturing practices, our product development and commercialization efforts may be harmed.\nThere are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under the FDA\u2019s and European Union\u2019s good manufacturing practices regulations and are capable of manufacturing products like those we are developing. Third-party manufacturers may encounter difficulties in achieving quality control and quality assurance and may experience shortages of qualified personnel. A failure of third-party manufacturers to follow current good manufacturing practices or other regulatory requirements and to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in the availability of products for commercial use or clinical study, the termination of, or hold on, a clinical study, or may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products. In addition, we could be subject to sanctions, including fines, injunctions and civil penalties. Changing manufacturers may require additional clinical trials and the revalidation of the manufacturing process and procedures in accordance with FDA mandated current good manufacturing practices and would require FDA approval. This revalidation may be costly and time consuming. If we are unable to arrange for third-party manufacturing of our products, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development or marketing of our products.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards will be subject to limitations upon a change in ownership, which could reduce our ability to use those loss carry forwards following any change in Company ownership.\nGenerally, a change of more than 50% in the ownership of a Company\u2019s stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An ownership change may limit our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards attributable to the period prior to such change. We have sold or otherwise issued shares of our common stock in various transactions sufficient to constitute an ownership change. As a result, if we earn net taxable income in the future, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry forwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income will be subject to limitations, which would restrict our ability to reduce future tax liability. Future shifts in our ownership, including transactions in which we may engage, may cause additional ownership changes, which could have the effect of imposing additional limitations on our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry forwards.\nRisks related to our industry\nIf we fail to secure adequate intellectual property protection, it could significantly harm our financial results and ability to compete.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and processes in the United States and elsewhere. We have filed and intend to continue to file patent applications as we need them. However, additional patents that may issue from any of these applications may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Also, any patents issued to us or licensed by us may be designed around or challenged by others, and if such design or challenge is effective, it may diminish our rights and negatively affect our financial results.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient protection of our proprietary rights in our products or processes prior to or after obtaining regulatory clearances, our competitors may be able to obtain regulatory clearance and market similar or competing products by demonstrating at a minimum the equivalency of their products to our products. If they are successful at demonstrating at least the equivalency between the products, our competitors would not have to conduct the same lengthy clinical tests that we have or will have conducted.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and confidential information that we protect by entering into confidentiality agreements with other parties. Those confidentiality agreements could be breached, and our remedies may be insufficient to protect the confidential information. Further, our competitors may independently learn our trade secrets or develop similar or superior technologies. To the extent that our consultants, key employees or others apply technological information independently developed by them or by others to our projects, disputes may arise regarding the proprietary rights to such information or developments. We cannot assure you that such disputes will be resolved in our favor.\nWe may be subject to potential product liability claims. One or more successful claims brought against us could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing of our products may expose us to product liability claims. We have never been subject to a product liability claim, and we require each patient in our clinical trials to sign an informed consent agreement that describes the risks related to the trials, but we cannot assure you that the coverage limits of our insurance policies will be adequate or that one or more successful claims brought against us would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and result of operations. Further, if one of our cannabinoid or ampakine compounds is approved by the FDA for marketing, we cannot assure you that adequate product liability insurance will be available, or if available, that it will be available at a reasonable cost. Any adverse outcome resulting from a product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition, and our competitors may develop products that are superior to those we are developing.\nOur business is characterized by intensive research efforts. Our competitors include many companies, research institutes and universities that are working in a number of pharmaceutical or biotechnology disciplines to develop therapeutic products similar to those we are currently investigating. Most of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and/or other resources than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have experience in performing human clinical trials of new or improved therapeutic products and obtaining approvals from the FDA and other regulatory agencies. We have limited experience in conducting and managing later-stage clinical testing or in preparing applications necessary to obtain regulatory approvals. Although we have engaged regulatory consultants and contract research organizations to assist us in such endeavors, it is possible that our competitors may succeed in developing products, or may obtain FDA approvals for their products faster than we can and/or such competitors may develop products that are safer or more effective than those that we are developing. We expect that competition in this field will continue to intensify.\nWe may be unable to recruit and retain our senior management and other key technical personnel on whom we are dependent.\nWe are highly dependent upon senior management and key technical personnel and currently do not carry any insurance policies on such persons. In particular, we are highly dependent on Arnold S. Lippa, Ph.D., our Interim Chief Executive Officer, Interim President, Chief Scientific Officer and Executive Chairman, Jeff E. Margolis, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, and Richard Purcell, our Senior Vice President of Research and development. Competition for qualified employees among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies is intense. The loss of any of our senior management or other key employees, or our inability to attract, retain and motivate the additional or replacement highly skilled employees and consultants that our business requires, could substantially hurt our business prospects.\nThe regulatory approval process is expensive, time consuming, uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining required approvals for the commercialization of some of our products.\nThe FDA and other similar agencies in foreign countries have substantial requirements for therapeutic products. Such requirements often involve lengthy and detailed laboratory, clinical and post-clinical testing procedures and are expensive to complete. It often takes companies many years to satisfy these requirements, depending on the complexity and novelty of the product. The review process is also extensive, which may delay the approval process even more.\nAs of yet, we have not obtained any approvals to market our products. Further, we cannot assure you that the FDA or other regulatory agency will grant us approval for any of our products on a timely basis, if at all. Even if regulatory clearances are obtained, a marketed product is subject to continual review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on marketing or withdrawal of the product from the market.\nRisks related to capital structure\nOur stock price is volatile and our common stock could decline in value.\nThe market price of securities of life sciences companies in general has been very unpredictable. The range of sales prices of our common stock for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, as quoted on the OTC QB, was $0.0771 to $0.8500 and $0.4000 to $2.9000, respectively. The following factors, in addition to factors that affect that market generally, could significantly affect our business, and the market price of our common stock could decline:\n\u25cf competitors announcing technological innovations or new commercial products;\n\u25cf competitors\u2019 publicity regarding actual or potential products under development;\n\u25cf regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u25cf legal developments regarding cannabinoids and cannabis products in the United States and foreign countries\n\u25cf developments concerning proprietary rights, including patent litigation;\n\u25cf public concern over the safety of therapeutic products; and\n\u25cf changes in healthcare reimbursement policies and healthcare regulations.\nOur common stock is thinly traded and you may be unable to sell some or all of your shares at the price you would like, or at all, and sales of large blocks of shares may depress the price of our common stock.\nOur common stock has historically been sporadically or \u201cthinly-traded,\u201d meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing shares of our common stock at prevailing prices at any given time may be relatively small or nonexistent. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in shares of our common stock is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer that has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. This could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. You may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your purchase price, which may result in substantial losses to you. Also, as a consequence of this lack of liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the price of shares of our common stock in either direction. The price of shares of our common stock could, for example, decline precipitously in the event a large number of shares of our common shares are sold on the market without commensurate demand, as compared to a seasoned issuer which could better absorb those sales without adverse impact on its share price.\nThere is a large number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock that may be issued or sold, and if such shares are issued or sold, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had 4,175,072 shares of our common stock outstanding.\nIf all warrants and options outstanding as of December 31, 2019 were exercised prior to their respective expiration dates, up to 6,478,652 additional shares of our common stock could become freely tradable. The issuance of such shares would dilute the interests of the current stockholders and sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could also make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2019, there were remaining outstanding convertible notes totaling $551,591 inclusive of accrued interest. Of that amount, $343,615 was convertible into 7,017,898 shares of common stock and the remainder into an indeterminate number of shares of common stock as such notes may convert, at the option of each note holder, acting separately and independently of the other note holders, into the next exempt private securities offering of equity securities.\nOn March 22, 2020, four holders of convertible notes convertible into a previously indeterminate number of shares, exchanged $172,911 principal and accrued interest through March 21, 2020, into 11,527,407 shares of common stock. On March 22, 2020, one holder of a convertible note totaling $82,875 of principal and accrued interest exchanged such holder\u2019s note into 5,525,017 shares of common stock. On March 22, 2020, two executive officers, each forgave $153,000 of accrued compensation for an aggregate of $306,000 and received an aggregate of 9,000,000 shares of common stock. As a result, a total of 26,052,424 shares of common stock were issued on that date.\nIf we issue additional equity or equity-based securities, the number of shares of our common stock outstanding could increase substantially, which could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could also make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock.\nOur charter document and other governing documents may prevent or delay an attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove management.\nCertain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our business, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, allows the Board of Directors of the Company to issue, as of December 31, 2019, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with characteristics to be determined by the board, without stockholder approval. The ability of our Board of Directors to issue additional preferred stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing an attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove existing directors and management.\nHistorically, warrants to purchase common stock have been issued as compensation for professional services, typically related to fund raising or have been issued in connection with the issuance of certain notes.\nIn addition, on at least two occasions, certain executive officers, members of the Board of Directors and certain vendors have offered to forgive accrued compensation and other amounts due to them, and the Board of Directors accepted such offers in exchange for either shares of common stock or options to purchase common stock. In particular, if executive officers offered and if the Board of Directors accepts such offer(s) in the future, a significant number of shares of common stock or one or more options to purchase a significant number of shares of common stock could be issued or granted. The ability of our Board of Directors to issue additional shares of common stock or options to purchase shares of common stock, or warrants to purchase shares of common stock, may have the effect of delaying or preventing an attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove existing directors and management.\nIf our common stock is determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock in the secondary market.\nIn addition, our common stock may be subject to the so-called \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) has adopted regulations that define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange. For any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If our common stock is determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market.", "PERMNO": 75962, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "RSPI"}
