{"cik": "316736", "company": "FIELDPOINT PETROLEUM CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS.\nGoing concern\nWe have incurred net losses of $10,983,270 and $1,947,940 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We expect that the Company will continue to experience operating losses and may have negative cash flow for so long as commodity prices remain depressed. The notes to our financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, include an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared \"assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.\" Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising additional capital to fund our operations and ultimately on generating future profitable operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital or continue to have positive cash flow from operations to address all of our cash flow needs. If we are not able to find alternative sources of cash or generate sufficient positive cash flow from operations, our business and shareholders may be materially and adversely affected.\nOil and gas operations are risky.\nWe compete in the areas of oil and gas exploration, production, development and transportation with other companies, many of which may have substantially larger financial and other resources. The nature of the oil and gas business also involves a variety of risks, including the risks of operating hazards such as fires, explosions, cratering, blow-outs, and encountering formations with abnormal pressures, the occurrence of any of which could result in losses to us. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks in amounts that management believes to be reasonable in accordance with customary industry practices. The occurrence of a significant event, however, that is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nA continuation of the decline in oil and natural gas prices would have a material impact on us.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production. Oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and more recently depressed and likely will continue to be volatile and depressed in historical standards in the future. This price volatility and depression will also affect our common stock price. We cannot predict oil and natural gas prices and prices may decline even further in the future. The following factors have an influence on oil and natural gas prices, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nchanges in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nstorage availability;\n\u25cf\nweather conditions;\n\u25cf\nmarket uncertainty;\n\u25cf\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations;\n\u25cf\nthe availability and cost of alternative fuel sources;\n\u25cf\nthe domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe price of foreign oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nrefining capacity;\n\u25cf\npolitical conditions in oil and natural gas producing regions, including the Middle East; and\n\u25cf\noverall economic conditions.\nTo counter this volatility we, from time to time, may enter into agreements to receive fixed prices on our oil and gas production to offset the risk of revenue losses if commodity prices decline; however, if commodity prices increase beyond the levels set in such agreements, we would not benefit from such increases.\nOur business will depend on transportation facilities owned by others.\nThe marketability of our gas production will depend in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline systems owned by third parties. Although we will have some contractual control over the transportation of our product, material changes in these business relationships could materially affect our operations. Federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather, and transport oil and natural gas.\nMarket conditions could cause us to incur losses on our transportation contracts.\nGas transportation contracts that we may enter into in the future may require us to transport minimum volumes of natural gas. If we ship smaller volumes, we may be liable for the shortfall. Unforeseen events, including production problems or substantial decreases in the price of natural gas, could cause us to ship less than the required volumes, resulting in losses on these contracts.\nOur actual production, revenues and expenditures related to our reserves are likely to differ from our estimates of our proved reserves. We may experience production that is less than estimated and drilling costs that are greater than estimated in our reserve reports. These differences may be material.\nThe proved oil, NGL and gas reserves data included in this report are estimates. Petroleum engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable oil, NGL and gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including:\n\u25cf\nhistorical production from the area compared with production from other similar producing areas;\n\u25cf\nthe assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies;\n\u25cf\nassumptions concerning future oil, NGL and gas prices; and\n\u25cf\nassumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and remedial costs.\nBecause all reserves estimates are to some degree subjective, each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating proved reserves:\n\u25cf\nthe quantities of oil, NGL and gas that are ultimately recovered;\n\u25cf\nthe production and operating costs incurred;\n\u25cf\nthe amount and timing of future development expenditures; and\n\u25cf\nfuture oil, NGL and gas prices.\nEstimates of proved undeveloped reserves are even less reliable than estimates of proved developed reserves. Furthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and future net revenues based on the same available data. Our actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely be different from estimates and the differences may be material.\nEstimating our reserves future net cash flows is difficult to do with any certainty.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and their values, including many factors beyond our control. The reserve data included in this report represents only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, the precision of the engineering and geological interpretation, and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers often vary. The estimates of reserves, future cash flows, and present value are based on various assumptions, including those prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and are inherently imprecise. There is no assurance that our present oil and gas wells will continue to produce at current or anticipated rates of production, or that production rates achieved in early periods can be maintained. Actual future production, cash flows, taxes, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from our estimates. Also, the use of a 10% discount factor for reporting purposes may not necessarily represent the most appropriate discount factor, given actual interest rates and risks to which our business or the oil and natural gas industry in general are subject.\nQuantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic conditions, including oil and natural gas prices in existence at the date of assessment. A reduction in oil and natural gas prices not only would reduce the value of any proved reserves, but also might reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that could be economically produced, thereby reducing the quantity of reserves. Our reserves and future cash flows may be subject to revisions, based upon changes in economic conditions, including oil and natural gas prices, as well as due to production results, operating costs, and other factors. Downward revisions of our reserves could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nAcquiring interests in other properties involves substantial risks.\nWe evaluate and acquire interests in oil and natural gas properties which in management's judgment will provide attractive investment opportunities for the addition of production and oil and gas reserves. To acquire producing properties or undeveloped exploratory acreage will require an assessment of a number of factors including:\n\u25cf\nValue of the properties and likelihood of future production;\n\u25cf\nRecoverable reserves;\n\u25cf\nOperating costs;\n\u25cf\nPotential environmental and other liabilities;\n\u25cf\nDrilling and production difficulties; and\n\u25cf\nOther factors beyond our control\nSuch assessments will necessarily be inexact and uncertain. Because of our limited financial resources, we may not be able to evaluate properties in a manner that is consistent with industry practices. Such reviews, therefore, may not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with such properties to assess fully the deficiencies or benefits.\nOperational risks in our business are numerous and could materially impact us.\nOil and natural gas drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered. We can make no assurance that wells in which we have an interest will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of investment costs.\nOur operations are also subject to hazards and risks inherent in drilling for and producing and transporting oil and natural gas, including, but not limited to, such hazards as:\n\u25cf\nFires;\n\u25cf\nExplosions;\n\u25cf\nBlowouts;\n\u25cf\nEncountering formations with abnormal pressures;\n\u25cf\nSpills\n\u25cf\nNatural disasters;\n\u25cf\nPipeline ruptures;\n\u25cf\nCratering\nIf any of these events occur in our operations, we could experience substantial losses due to:\n\u25cf\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u25cf\nsevere damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u25cf\npollution or other environmental damage;\n\u25cf\nclean-up responsibilities;\n\u25cf\nregulatory investigation and penalties; and\n\u25cf\nother losses resulting in suspension of our operations.\nIn accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above with a general liability limit of $1 million. We do not maintain insurance for damages arising out of exposure to radioactive material. Even in the case of risks against which we are insured, our policies are subject to limitations and exceptions that could cause us to be unprotected against some or all of the risk. The occurrence of an uninsured loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe must comply with environmental regulations.\nExploratory and other oil and natural gas wells must be operated in compliance with complex and changing environmental laws and regulations adopted by federal, state and local government authorities. The implementation of new, or the modification of existing, laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on properties in which we may have an interest. Discharge of oil, natural gas, water, or other pollutants to the oil, soil, or water may give rise to significant liabilities to government and third parties and may require us to incur substantial cost of remediation. We may be required to agree to indemnify sellers of properties purchased against certain liabilities for environmental claims associated with those properties. We can give no assurance that existing environmental laws or regulations, as currently interpreted, or as they may be reinterpreted in the future, or future laws or regulations will not materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions.\nEnvironmental liabilities could adversely affect our business\nIn the event of a release of oil, natural gas, or other pollutants from our operations into the environment, we could incur liability for personal injuries, property damage, cleanup costs, and governmental fines.\nWe could potentially discharge these materials into the environment in any of the following ways:\n\u25cf\nfrom a well or drilling equipment at a drill site;\n\u25cf\nleakage from gathering systems, pipelines, transportation facilities and storage tanks;\n\u25cf\ndamage to oil and natural gas wells resulting from accidents during normal operations; and\n\u25cf\nblowouts, cratering, and explosions.\nIn addition, because we may acquire interests in properties that have been operated in the past by others, we may be liable for environmental damage, including historical contamination, caused by such former operators. Additional liabilities could also arise from continuing violations or contamination not discovered during our assessment of the acquired properties.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in our production of oil and gas and lower returns on our capital investments.\nBills were introduced in the previous U.S. Congress to regulate hydraulic fracturing operations and related injection of fracturing fluids and propping agents used in fracturing fluids by the oil and natural gas industry under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (\u201cSDWA\u201d) and to require the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process under the SDWA, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (\u201cEPCRA\u201d) or other authority. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of unconventional oil and natural gas wells in shale and tight sand formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production. We engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us for many of the wells that we drill and operate. Sponsors of such bills have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies, surface waters, and other natural resources, and threaten health and safety. In addition, the EPA has announced its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the potential adverse impacts that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health and the EPA issued a draft study plan on hydraulic fracturing. Certain states have also considered or imposed reporting obligations relating to the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques.\nAdditional legislation or regulation could make it easier for parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. There has also been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to use of fracturing fluids, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated in Texas and other states implicating hydraulic fracturing practices.\nLegislation, regulation, litigation and enforcement actions at the federal, state or local level that restrict the provision of hydraulic fracturing services could limit the availability and raise the cost of such services, delay completion of new wells and production of our oil and gas, lower our return on capital expenditures and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and quantities of oil and gas reserves that may be economically produced.\nWe engage in commodity derivative transactions which involve risks that can harm our business.\nTo manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our production, we enter into commodity derivative agreements. While intended to reduce the effects of volatile commodity prices, such transactions may limit our potential gains and increase our potential losses if commodity prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the commodity derivative. In addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which our production is lower than expected. We are also exposed to the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the commodity derivative agreements.\nFederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives and private litigation relating to hydraulic fracturing could stop or delay our development project and result in materially increased costs and additional operating restrictions.\nAll of our proved non-producing and proved undeveloped reserves associated with future drilling and completion projects will require hydraulic fracturing. If these or any other new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to drill and produce from our proved reserves, as well as make it easier for third parties opposing hydraulic fracturing to initiate legal proceedings. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to permitting delays and increases in costs. These developments, as well as new laws or regulations, could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of our failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to use hydraulic fracturing in completing our wells or hydraulic fracturing becomes prohibited or significantly regulated or restricted, we could lose the ability to drill and complete the projects for our proved reserves and maintain our current leasehold acreage, which would have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPart of our strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques, which involve risks and uncertainties in their application.\nOur operations involve using some of the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers. Risks that we face while drilling horizontal wells include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nlanding our wellbore in the desired drilling zone;\n\u25cf\nstaying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation;\n\u25cf\nrunning our casing the entire length of the wellbore; and\n\u25cf\nbeing able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore.\nRisks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nthe ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages;\n\u25cf\nthe ability to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations; and\n\u25cf\nthe ability to successfully clean out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.\nThe results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer or emerging formations and areas have limited or no production history and, consequently, we are more limited in assessing future drilling results in these areas. If our drilling results are less than anticipated, the return on our investment for a particular project may not be as attractive as we anticipated and we could incur material write-downs of unevaluated properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nChanges in tax laws may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nIn recent years there has been introduced, from time to time, proposed legislation that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including the elimination of certain key United States federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nrepeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties;\n\u25cf\nelimination of current deductions for intangible drilling costs;\n\u25cf\nelimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction for oil and gas companies; and\n\u25cf\nextension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures.\nIt is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or otherwise limit certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development, and any such change could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOil, NGL and gas prices are volatile. Continued depressed oil, NGL or gas prices would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements and financial commitments.\nOur revenues, profitability and cash flow depend substantially upon the prices and demand for oil, NGLs and gas. The markets for these commodities are volatile, and even relatively modest drops in prices can affect significantly our financial results and impede our growth. Prices for oil, NGLs and gas fluctuate\nwidely in response to changes in the supply and demand for these commodities, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control, such as:\n\u25cf\ndomestic and foreign supply of oil, NGLs and gas;\n\u25cf\ndomestic and foreign consumer demand for oil, NGLs and gas;\n\u25cf\noverall United States and global economic conditions impacting the global supply of and demand for oil, NGLs and gas;\n\u25cf\nthe willingness and ability of OPEC to set and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u25cf\ncommodity processing, gathering and transportation availability, the availability of refining capacity and other factors that result in differentials to benchmark prices;\n\u25cf\nprice and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u25cf\nprice and quantity of foreign imports;\n\u25cf\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations;\n\u25cf\npolitical conditions in or affecting other oil and natural gas producing countries;\n\u25cf\nweather conditions, including unseasonably warm winter weather and tropical storms; and\n\u25cf\ntechnological advances affecting oil, NGL and gas consumption.\nAdvanced drilling and completion technologies, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, have resulted in increased investment by oil and gas producers in developing U.S. shale oil and gas projects and, therefore, has resulted in increased production from these projects. The results of higher investment in the exploration for and production of U.S. shale oil and gas, maintenance of production levels of oil from the Middle East, and other factors, such as global economic and financial conditions, have caused the price of oil and gas to fall. Over the six months ending January 15, 2016, the NYMEX settled prices for oil and natural gas have declined by approximately 50%. During the 52 week period ended January 15, 2016, the prices for oil and natural gas (\u201cBOE\u201d) ranged from a high of $65 and a low of $27 per BOE, with the closing price at January 20, 2016 of approximately $30. Prices may stay suppressed for some time from the levels experienced during the last few years.\nThe Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, access to capital and the amount of oil and gas that may be economically produced would be negatively impacted if oil and gas prices stay depressed for an extended period of time.\nThe ways that continued low oil and gas prices could affect us include the following:\n\u25cf\nCash flows would be reduced, decreasing funds available for capital expenditures needed to maintain or increase production and replace reserves;\n\u25cf\nFuture net cash flows from our properties would decrease, which could result in significant impairment expenses;\n\u25cf\nSome reserves would no longer be economic to produce, leading to lower proved reserves, production and cash flows; and\n\u25cf\nAccess to capital, such as equity or long-term debt markets and current reserve-based lending levels, would be severely limited or unavailable.\nIf the current decline in oil prices continues, it is unlikely that our future cash flows will be sufficient to fund the capital expenditure levels necessary to maintain current production and reserve levels over the long term and our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nLower oil and gas prices would not only cause our revenues and cash flows to decrease but also would reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically. Substantial decreases in oil and gas prices will render uneconomic some or all of our drilling locations. This has and may continue to result in our having to impair our estimated proved reserves and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we experienced with the recent downward adjustment of our borrowing base under our credit facility with Citibank, a decline in oil, NGL or gas prices for an extended period of time can result in our being unable to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity, repay current or future debt or obtain additional capital on attractive terms, all of which can affect the value of our common stock. The amount available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is determined by our lenders taking into account our estimated proved reserves and is subject to semi-annual redeterminations based on pricing models determined by the lenders at such time. As we saw in December 2015 with the lowering of our borrowing base, the recent decline in oil and gas prices has adversely impacted the value of our estimated proved reserves and, in turn, the market values used by our lenders to determine our borrowing base.\nWe may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet our debt obligations.\nWe expect our earnings and cash flow to vary significantly from year to year due to the nature of our industry. As a result, the amount of debt that we can manage in some periods may not be appropriate for us in other periods. Additionally, our future cash flow may be insufficient to meet our debt obligations and other commitments. In December 2015, our senior lender decreased our borrowing base from $11 million to $5.5 million, at which time our outstanding drawn balance was $6.5 million. We have yet to cure the resultant overdrawn deficiency, and the revolving credit facility matures in October 2016. There can be no assurance that our senior lender will extend the maturity date of the credit facility. We are currently in default under the line of credit, and as senior secured lender, Citibank could foreclose on our assets. A range of economic, competitive, business and industry factors will affect our future financial performance, and, as a result, our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay our debt. Many of these factors, such as oil and gas prices, economic and financial conditions in our industry and the global economy and initiatives of our competitors, are beyond our control. If we do not generate enough cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:\n\u25cf\nselling assets;\n\u25cf\nreducing or delaying capital investments;\n\u25cf\nseeking to raise additional capital; or\n\u25cf\nrefinancing or restructuring our debt.\nIf, for any reason, we are unable to meet our debt service and repayment obligations, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our debt, which would allow our creditors at that time to declare all outstanding indebtedness to be due and payable, which would in turn trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default rights between the relevant agreements. If amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility were to be accelerated, we cannot be certain that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders or to our other debt holders.\nOur lenders can limit our borrowing capabilities, which may materially impact our operations.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had approximately $6.5 million in borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and our borrowing base was reduced by our senior lender to approximately $5.5 million due to an impairment of our borrowing base. The borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is redetermined semi-annually based upon a number of factors, including commodity prices and reserve levels. In addition to such semi-annual redeterminations, our lenders may request one additional redetermination during any 12-month period. We expect that our borrowing base will be redetermined in the second quarter of 2016. We expect that the redetermination may result in a further material reduction in our borrowing base. Upon a further redetermination, our borrowing base could be reduced again, and if the amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility at any time exceeds the borrowing base at such time, we may be required to repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings. If the significant reduction in commodity prices continues or accelerates, it is likely that our borrowing base will be reduced further in the next semi-annual borrowing base redetermination. We use cash flow from operations and bank borrowings to fund our exploration, development and acquisition activities. A reduction in our borrowing base could limit those activities. In addition, we may significantly change our capital structure to cover our working capital needs, make future acquisitions or develop our properties. Changes in capital structure may significantly increase our debt. If we incur additional debt for these or other purposes, the related risks that we now face could intensify. A higher level of debt also increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of debt depends on our future performance, which is affected by general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our revolving credit facility contain operating and financial restrictions and covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities or that economic conditions and commodity prices may cause us to breach.\nOur revolving credit facility contains, and any future indebtedness we incur may contain, a number of restrictive covenants that will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nsell assets, including equity interests in our subsidiaries;\n\u25cf\nconsolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u25cf\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;\n\u25cf\nredeem or prepay other debt;\n\u25cf\npay distributions on, redeem or repurchase our common stock or redeem or repurchase our subordinated debt;\n\u25cf\ncreate or incur certain liens;\n\u25cf\nmake certain acquisitions and investments;\n\u25cf\nenter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;\n\u25cf\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf\ncreate unrestricted subsidiaries;\n\u25cf\nenter into financing transactions; and\n\u25cf\nengage in certain business activities.\nAs a result of these covenants, we will be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nOur revolving credit facility also contains financial covenants. Our ability to comply with some of the covenants and restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions do not improve, or if commodity prices remain at their current depressed levels, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A failure to comply with the covenants, ratios or tests in our revolving credit facility or any future indebtedness could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If an event of default under our revolving credit facility occurs and remains uncured, the lenders:\n\u25cf\nwould not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;\n\u25cf\ncould elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable;\n\u25cf\nmay have the ability to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings; or\n\u25cf\nmay prevent us from making debt service payments under our other agreements.\nPrice declines during 2015 resulted in a material write down of the carrying values of our properties, and further price declines could result in additional write downs in the future, which would negatively impact our net income and results of operations. Additionally, current SEC rules also could require us to write down our proved undeveloped reserves in the future.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our properties for possible impairment. Based on prevailing commodity prices and specific market factors and circumstances at the time of impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our properties. A write-down is a non-cash charge to earnings. We may incur impairment charges in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken. The risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our properties increases when oil and gas prices are low or volatile.\nIn addition, current SEC rules require that proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time. This rule may limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our development projects. Moreover, we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill those wells within the required timeframe or if continued, depressed prices cause us to change our development plan to decrease the number of wells to be drilled over the five-year period.\nThe Standardized Measure of our estimated reserves and PV-10 included in this report should not be considered as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to our properties.\nStandardized Measure is a reporting convention that provides a common basis for comparing oil and gas companies subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Standardized Measure requires the use of specific pricing as required by the SEC as well as operating and development costs prevailing as of the date of computation. The non-GAAP financial measure, PV-10, is based on the average of the closing price on the first day of the month for the 12-month period prior to fiscal year end, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower.\nConsequently, these measures may not reflect the prices ordinarily received or that will be received for oil and gas production because of varying market conditions, nor may they reflect the actual costs that will be required to produce or develop the oil and gas properties. Accordingly, estimates included herein of future net cash flow may be materially different from the future net cash flows that are ultimately received. Therefore, the Standardized Measure of our estimated reserves and PV-10 included in this report should not be construed as accurate estimates of the current fair value of our proved reserves. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating PV-10 may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general. Actual future net revenues also will be affected by factors such as the amount and timing of actual production, prevailing operating and development costs, supply and demand for oil and gas, increases or decreases in consumption and changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, and we are smaller and have a more limited operating history than many of our competitors.\nWe compete with major integrated oil and gas companies and independent oil and gas companies in all areas of operation. In particular, we compete for property acquisitions and for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties. Most of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have. In addition, larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. These competitors may be able to pay more for properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for, and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can. Further, our competitors may have technological advantages and may be able to implement new technologies more rapidly than we can. Our ability to explore for natural gas and oil prospects and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend on our ability to conduct operations, to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment. In addition, most of our competitors have operated for a much longer time than we have and have demonstrated the ability to operate through industry cycles.\nOur operations substantially depend on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain, dispose of or recycle water may impact our ability to execute our drilling and development plans in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nWater is an essential component of our drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, we have been able to secure water from local landowners and other sources for use in our operations. During the last three years, much of the Southwest region where we operate has experienced extreme drought conditions. As a result of the severe drought, governmental authorities have restricted the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for drilling and hydraulic fracturing to protect the local water supply. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations, we may be unable to economically produce oil, NGLs and gas, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and gas. Compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements for the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or ground water necessary for hydraulic fracturing may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or cessation of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, and all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nClimate change legislation or regulations regulating emissions of GHGs and VOCs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and gas we produce.\nBoth houses of Congress have actively considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and some states have already taken measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. Most of these cap-and-trade programs require either major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. These allowances are expected to escalate significantly in cost over time.\nIn addition, in December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to human health and the environment, because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings by the EPA allow the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. The EPA has also issued final regulations under the NSPS and NESHAP designed to reduce VOCs. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce GHG or VOC emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to power plants or refineries could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG or VOC emissions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernmental regulations can hinder production.\nDomestic oil and natural gas exploration, production and sales are extensively regulated at both the federal and state levels. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, have legal authority to issue, and have issued, rules and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry which often are difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial penalties for noncompliance. State statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, and reports concerning operations. Most states where we operate also have statutes and regulations governing conservation matters, including the unitization or pooling of properties. Our operations are also subject to numerous laws and regulations governing plugging and abandonment, discharging materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. The heavy regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases its costs of doing business and consequently affects its profitability. Changes in the laws, rules or regulations, or the interpretation thereof, could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation.\nMinority or royalty interest purchases do not allow us to control production completely.\nWe sometimes acquire less than the controlling working interest in oil and natural gas properties. In such cases, it is likely that these properties would not be operated by us. When we do not have controlling interest, the operator or the other co-owners might take actions we do not agree with and possibly increase costs or reduce production income in ways we do not agree with.\nEnvironmental regulations can hinder production.\nOil and natural gas activities can result in liability under federal, state and local environmental regulations for activities involving, among other things, water pollution and hazardous waste transport, storage, and disposal. Such liability can attach not only to the operator of record of the well, but also to other parties that may be deemed to be current or prior operators or owners of the wells or the equipment involved. We have inspections performed on our properties to assure environmental law compliance, but inspections may not always be performed on every well, and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken.\nGovernment regulations could increase our operating costs\nOil and natural gas operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for, and development, production and transportation of, oil and natural gas, as well as safety matters, which may change from time to time in response to economic conditions. Matters subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities include:\n\u25cf\nPermits for drilling operations;\n\u25cf\nThe production and disposal of water;\n\u25cf\nReports concerning operations;\n\u25cf\nUnitization and pooling of properties;\n\u25cf\nRoad and pipeline construction;\n\u25cf\nThe spacing of wells;\n\u25cf\nTaxation;\n\u25cf\nProduction rates;\n\u25cf\nThe conservation of oil and natural gas; and\n\u25cf\nDrilling bonds.\nMany jurisdictions have at various times imposed limitations on the production of oil and natural gas by restricting the rate of flow for oil and natural gas wells below their actual capacity to produce. During the past few years there has been a significant amount of discussion by legislators and the presidential administration concerning a variety of energy tax proposals. There can be no certainty that any such measure will be passed or what its effect will be on oil and natural gas prices if it is passed. In addition, many states have raised state taxes on energy sources and additional increases may occur, although there can be no certainty of the effect that increases in state energy taxes would have on oil and natural gas prices. Although we believe it is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and other government laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that significant costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future.\nWe have not paid cash dividends and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe anticipate that we will retain all future earnings and other cash resources for the future operation and development of our business. We do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account many factors, including our operating results, financial condition, current and anticipated cash needs, and other factors. Moreover, there may be no capacity for the Company to declare a cash dividend in the near future.", "PERMNO": 32687, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "FPPP"}
