{"cik": "1473334", "company": "Nova Lifestyle, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business and an investment in our securities are subject to a variety of risks. The following risk factors describe the most significant events, facts or circumstances that could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to implement our business plan and the market price for our securities. Many of these events are outside of our control. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors in our common stock could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nChanges in economic conditions in the industries and markets served by our customers could adversely affect demand for our products.\nThe furniture industry is subject to cyclical variations in the global economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects. Our business is affected by the number of orders we are able to secure from our customers, which is determined by the level of our customers\u2019 business activity. Our customers\u2019 level of business activity is in turn determined by the level of consumer spending in the markets our customers serve. Home furnishings generally are considered a postponeable purchase by most consumers. Economic downturns could affect discretionary consumer spending habits by decreasing the overall demand for home furnishings. Any significant or prolonged decline of the economy in China, the U.S. or other international markets in which our products are sold will affect disposable income and spending by consumers in these markets, and may lead to a decrease in demand for consumer products. To the extent that such decrease in demand for consumer products translates into a decline in the demand for home furnishings, our sales and financial performance could be adversely affected. Any economic downturn also could negatively impact our primary customers, furniture wholesalers, distributors and retailers, possibly resulting in a decrease in our sales or earnings. Changes in interest rates, consumer confidence, new housing starts, existing home sales, the availability of consumer credit and geopolitical factors could have particularly significant effects on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any decline in economic activity and conditions in the industries and markets served by our customers and in which we operate may reduce demand for our products and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe historically have derived a substantial part of our sales from a limited number of customers. If we lose any of these customers, or any of these customers reduce the amount of business they do with us, our sales may be adversely affected.\nHistorically, a substantial part of our sales was attributed to a limited number of customers. Two major customers accounted for 14% and 26%, respectively, of our total sales in 2014 and 2013. If we lose either of these customers or they reduce the amount of business they do with us, our sales and profitability may be adversely affected. In addition, sales to our largest customer constituted of sales primarily to markets in the European Union. If the demand for our products decreases in one or more of the markets in the European Union supplied by our largest customer, or if there is any material social or regulatory changes in these markets, our sales could decline and we could lose market share, any of which could materially harm our business. We do not foresee relying on these same customers for sales generation as we expand our business to increase our sales to product franchise stores in China and direct sales to the U.S. and other international markets. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to successfully implement these plans.\nIf we lose our key personnel, or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, the quality of our services may decline and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely heavily on the expertise, experience and continued services of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Wong, our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Ho, and our President and Chairperson, Ms. Lam. Loss of their services could adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. Messrs. Wong and Ho and Ms. Lam are key factors in our success at establishing relationships within the furniture industry in China, the U.S. and international market because of their extensive industry experience and reputation. The continued development of our business depends upon their continued employment. We have entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Wong and Ho and Ms. Lam that include provisions for non-competition and confidentiality.\nWe believe our future success will depend upon our ability to retain key employees and our ability to attract and retain other skilled personnel. The rapid growth of the economy in China has caused intense competition for qualified personnel. We cannot guarantee that any employee will remain employed by us for any period of time or that we will be able to attract, train or retain qualified personnel in the future. Such loss of personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and company. Furthermore, we will need to employ additional personnel to expand our business. Qualified employees are in great demand and may be unavailable in the time frame required to satisfy our customers\u2019 requirements. There is no assurance we will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees in the future. The loss of personnel or our inability to hire or retain sufficient personnel at competitive rates could impair the growth of our business.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with competition in our industry, which could adversely affect our market share and result in a decrease in our future sales and earnings.\nThe furniture industry in China, the U.S. and international markets is very competitive and fragmented. Our business is subject to risks associated with competition from new or existing industry participants who may have more resources and better access to capital. Many of our competitors and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial and government support, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we do. Among other things, these industry participants compete with us based upon price, quality, style, functionality and availability. We cannot be sure we will have the resources or expertise to compete successfully in the future. Some of our competitors may also be able to provide customers with additional benefits at lower overall costs to increase market share. We cannot be sure we will be able to match cost reductions by our competitors or that we will be able to succeed in the face of current or future competition. Also, due to the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings, we may not be able to continue to differentiate our products through value, styling or functionality from those of our competitors. In addition, some of our customers are also performing more manufacturing services themselves. We may face competition from our customers as they seek to become more vertically integrated. As a result, we are continually subject to the risk of losing market share, which may lower our sales and earnings.\nWe will face different market dynamics and competition as we develop new products to expand our presence in our target markets. In some markets, our future competitors may have greater brand recognition and broader distribution than we currently enjoy. We may not be as successful as our competitors in generating revenues in those markets due to the lack of recognition of our brands, lack of customer acceptance, lack of product quality history and other factors. As a result, any new expansion efforts could be more costly and less profitable than our efforts in our existing markets. If we are not as successful as our competitors are in our target markets, our sales could decline, our margins could be impacted negatively and we could lose market share, any of which could materially harm our business.\nWe may lose U.S. market share due to competition and our dependence on production facilities located outside the U.S., which would result in a decrease in our future sales and earnings.\nWe compete in the U.S. market principally through our sales under the Diamond Sofa brand, which we acquired on August 31, 2011. The furniture industry in the U.S. is very competitive and fragmented. We compete with many domestic U.S. and international residential furniture sources, including national department stores, regional or independent specialty stores, dedicated franchises of furniture manufacturers and retailers marketing products through catalogs and over the internet. There are few barriers to entry in the U.S. furniture market, and new competitors may enter this market at any time. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we have and often offer extensively advertised and well-recognized branded products. We may not be able to meet price competition or otherwise respond to competitive pressures in the U.S. market. We also may not be able to continue to differentiate our products from those of our competitors in the U.S. through value, styling and functionality because of the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings. In addition, our operations in the U.S. depend primarily on our sourcing of products through Nova Macao, which is subject to increased risks of delays in shipments to the U.S. not typically encountered for domestically sourced furniture, such as shipment delays caused by customs, export and tariff issues, production disruptions and labor issues at our Nova Dongguan facilities, decreased availability of shipping containers and the inability to secure space aboard shipping vessels to transport our products. Our failure to fill customer orders in a timely manner during an extended business interruption for Nova Macao or Nova Dongguan, or due to transportation issues, could negatively impact our existing customer relationships in the U.S. market and result in decreased sales and earnings. Furthermore, some large furniture retailers in the U.S. are sourcing products directly from furniture manufacturers located in China and other Southeast Asian countries instead of through distributors like us. Over time, this practice may expand to smaller retailers in the U.S. Accordingly; we are continually subject to the risk of losing U.S. market share, which may decrease our future sales and earnings.\nFailure to anticipate or timely respond to changes in fashion and consumer preferences could adversely impact our business.\nFurniture is a styled product and is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences, as well as to increasingly shorter product life cycles. We believe our past performance has been based on, and our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to continue to improve our existing products through product innovation and to develop, market and produce new products. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in introducing, marketing and producing any new products or product innovations, or that we will develop and introduce in a timely manner innovations in our existing products that satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance. Our success also depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends related to residential furniture. If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales could decline and we could lose market share, any of which could materially harm our business.\nFluctuations in the price, availability or quality of raw materials for our products could cause manufacturing delays, adversely affect our ability to provide goods to our customers or increase costs, any of which could decrease our sales or earnings.\nOur major raw material purchases include MDF board, particleboard, stainless and carbon steel, leather, glass and lacquers. We depend on outside suppliers for these raw materials and must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from these suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner. We do not maintain fixed supply contracts with our suppliers. Unfavorable fluctuations in the price, quality or availability of required raw materials could negatively affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers. Our inability to meet customers\u2019 demands could result in the loss of future sales.\nThe profitability of our products depends in part upon the margin between the cost to us of certain raw materials and our fabrication costs associated with converting such raw materials into assembled products, as compared to the selling price of our products. We intend to continue to base the selling prices of our products in part upon their associated raw material costs. However, we may not be able to pass all increases in raw material cost or increases in the costs associated with taking possession of raw materials through to our customers in the future. The inability to offset price increases of raw materials by sufficient product price increases would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe do not engage in hedging transactions to protect against raw material fluctuations, but attempt to mitigate the short-term risks of price swings by purchasing raw materials in advance based on production needs or reaching agreements with some of our suppliers to keep the cost of raw materials stable.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth, we may not continue to be profitable.\nOur continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage and expand our operations and facilities in the face of continued growth. This planned growth includes the expansion of our network of franchise stores and introduction of new product brands in China and diversifying our international sales by expanding our broad network of distributors, increasing direct sales in the U.S., Europe and other international markets and entering emerging growth markets. The growth in our operations has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management, operational and financial infrastructure. If we do not manage our growth effectively, the quality of our products and services could suffer, which could negatively affect our operating results. To manage this growth effectively, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. We cannot assure you that we will be able to fulfill our staffing requirements for our business, successfully train and assimilate new employees, or expand our management base and enhance our operating and financial systems. Failure to achieve any of these goals will prevent us from managing our growth in an effective manner and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may need additional capital to execute our business plan and fund operations and may not be able to obtain such capital on acceptable terms or at all.\nIn connection with the development and expansion of our business, we may incur significant capital and operational expenses. We believe that we can increase our sales and net income by implementing a growth strategy that focuses on (i) increasing direct sales of our products into the China retail market and (ii) diversifying our international sales. To implement our growth strategy, we intend to expand our network of product franchise stores and introduce new product brands through internet sales in China, which commenced in September 2012. We also plan to increase and diversify our sales to the U.S., Europe and international markets by further integrating the Bright Swallow International Group Limited brand family and establishing new brands for the international markets. Although we are changing our sales and marketing strategy to diversify international sales, we intend to continue supplying products directly to retailers and chain stores under ODM and OEM agreements and private label brands.\nManagement anticipates that our existing capital resources, cash flows from operations, collection of our accounts receivable, and loan facilities that we entered into in 2012, any proceeds from any possible financings related to the shelf registration statement on Form S-3 we filed in February 2014, which became effective on March 7, 2014, and the aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $8.95 million from the closing of the transactions contemplated under the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 14, 2014 and described in greater detail herein, will satisfy the liquidity requirements of our business for the next 12 months. However, if available funds are not sufficient to meet our plans for expansion, our plans include pursuing alternative financing arrangements, including additional bank loans based on our good credit rating or funds raised through additional offerings of our equity or debt, if and when we determine such offerings are required. Our ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms or at all is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf\nInvestors\u2019 perceptions of, and demand for, companies in our industry;\n\u25cf\nInvestors\u2019 perceptions of, and demand for, companies operating in China;\n\u25cf\nConditions of the U.S. and other capital markets in which we may seek to raise funds;\n\u25cf\nOur future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows;\n\u25cf\nGovernmental regulation of foreign investment in companies in particular countries;\n\u25cf\nEconomic, political and other conditions in the U.S., China, and other countries; and\n\u25cf\nGovernmental policies relating to foreign currency borrowings.\nThere is no assurance we will be successful in locating a suitable financing transaction in a timely fashion or at all. In addition, there is no assurance we will obtain the capital we require by any other means. Future financings through equity investments are likely to be dilutive to our existing shareholders. Also, the terms of securities we may issue in future capital transactions may be more favorable for our new investors. Newly-issued securities may include preferences or superior voting rights, be combined with the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, or be the issuances of incentive awards under equity employee incentive plans, which may have additional dilutive effects. Furthermore, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital and financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which will adversely impact our financial condition. If we cannot raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all, we may not be able to carry out all or parts of our strategy to maintain our growth and competitiveness.\nOur accounts receivable remain outstanding for a significant period of time, which has a negative impact on our cash flow and liquidity.\nOur standard payment term for accounts receivable is 30 - 120 days. We give an extended payment term to certain of our major customers of up to 180 days. Our sales to customers in the U.S. and international markets typically are made through letters of credit, but for some long-term, high volume customers, we accept payment by telegraphic transfer with a payment term of 15 days after delivery. We remain subject to negative impacts on our cash flow and liquidity due to the significant period of time our accounts receivable remain outstanding with respect to sales made under the longer payment terms. In 2013, we had accounts receivable turnover of 3.11 on an annualized basis, with sales outstanding of 117 days and inventory turnover of 19.10 on an annualized basis. In 2014, we had accounts receivable turnover of 2.78 on an annualized basis, with sales outstanding of 131.29 days and inventory turnover of 22.74 on an annualized basis. As of December 31, 2014, we had gross accounts receivable of $43,370,501, of which $31,492,022 was with aging within 90 days, $3,671,118 was with aging over 90 days, and $8,207,361 was with aging over 120 days; we had an allowance for bad debt of $398,991 for accounts receivables. The increase in accounts receivable was due to, among other things, Diamond Bar\u2019s 41% increase in sales in the year ended December 31, 2014 to $33.34 million, compared to $23.64 million in 2013, as well as a result of Nova Macao\u2019s 23% increase in sales in the year ended December 31, 2014 to $39.89 million, compared to $32.41 million in 2013. Additionally, we have granted longer terms to major customers to maintain good relationships and to attract new major accounts and the Company has been more lenient towards the collection of accounts receivable from certain major customers whose accounts receivable are guaranteed by Sinosure (China Export and Credit Insurance Company) credit insurance. While historically our collections have been reasonably assured, delays in collections and the significant period of time our accounts receivable remain outstanding may result in pressure on our cash flow and liquidity. We are initiating a study of our receivables management process and based upon the resulting recommendations intend to adopt additional protocols during this annual period to insure we are optimizing our collections as well as general management efficiencies.\nWe may experience material disruptions to our manufacturing operations in China that could result in material delays, quality control issues, increased costs and loss of business opportunities, which may negatively impact our sales and financial results.\nWe rely primarily upon our manufacturing facilities located in Dongguan, Guangdong, China, to operate our business and produce our products. While we seek to operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities, a material disruption at our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and negatively impact our financial results. Our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within our otherwise operational facilities, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including: prolonged power failures; equipment failures; disruptions in the transportation infrastructure including roads, bridges, railroad tracks; and fires, floods, earthquakes, acts of war, or other catastrophes. Our future growth strategy includes an anticipated expansion of manufacturing capacity to meet increasing demand for our existing products. Any projects undertaken by us to increase such capacity may not be constructed on the anticipated timetable or within budget. We may also experience quality control issues as we implement these manufacturing upgrades and ramp up production. Any such material disruption may prevent us from shipping our products on a timely basis, reduce our sales and market share and negatively impact our financial results.\nWe face risks associated with managing operations in China, any of which could decrease our sales or earnings.\nAll of our manufacturing operations currently are conducted by Nova Dongguan in China. There are a number of risks inherent in doing business in China, including the following: unfavorable political or economic factors; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; potentially adverse tax consequences; unexpected legal or regulatory changes; lack of sufficient protection for intellectual property rights; difficulties in recruiting and retaining personnel, and managing international operations; and less developed infrastructure. Furthermore, changes in the political, economic and social conditions in China from which these risks are derived could make it more difficult to provide products and services to our customers. Our inability to manage these risks successfully could adversely affect our business and manufacturing operations. We can provide no assurances that any new market expansion by us in China or in the U.S. and international markets will be successful because of the risks associated with conducting our manufacturing operations in China, including the risks listed above.\nWe may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for our products, which could result in a decrease in clients and revenue, unexpected expenses and loss of market share.\nOur products are subject to PRC and international regulations related to the furniture industry. China has a series of compulsory and recommended national standards, or the GB and QB standards, that govern certain technical, safety and quality requirements for furniture manufactured in and exported from China. Our products are also subject to the mandatory and voluntary furniture test standards of the U.S. and international markets in which our customers distribute our products to end consumers, including environmental, ecological and formaldehyde emission standards and source of origin labeling requirements developed by ANSI/BIFMA, ASTM, CARB, FIRA and ISO. As of December 31, 2014, we have no regulatory approvals pending for our products or that we still need to obtain to conduct our business. We seek to manufacture all products to customer specifications and we believe that our products meet all currently applicable national and international furniture test standards. Any failure to manufacture and deliver products in compliance with all applicable standards and regulations for the markets in which our products are distributed may subject us to fines, penalties or business interruptions and could result in a decrease in clients or loss of market share. In addition, new or revised standards and regulations applicable to our products could require us to redesign existing and planned products, acquire new manufacturing equipment or incur other significant expenses. If we are not able to obtain regulatory approvals for our products based on the applicable standards and regulations, it could have material and adverse effects on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from potential losses.\nWe have purchased property insurance for our properties in China, including raw materials, semi-manufactured goods, manufactured goods, buildings and machinery equipment. Our property insurance may not cover the full value of our property and equipment, however, which would leave us exposed in the event of loss or damage to our properties in China or claims filed against us.\nWe do not maintain business interruption insurance. The insurance industry in China is in its early stage of development and the business interruption insurance and the product liability insurance available currently in China offers limited coverage compared to that offered in many other countries, especially in the U.S. Any business disruption or natural disaster could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our business operations in China, particularly our production facilities, involve risks and hazards that could result in damage to, or destruction of, property and machinery, personal injury, business interruption and possible legal liability. In addition, we do not have product liability insurance covering bodily injuries and property damage caused by the products we sell. Therefore, we are exposed to risks associated with product liability claims and may need to bear the litigation cost if the use of our products results in bodily injury or property damage. We do not carry key-man life insurance, and if we lose the services of any senior management and key personnel, we may not be able to locate suitable or qualified replacements, and may incur additional expenses to recruit and train new personnel, which could severely disrupt our business and prospects. We do not have personal injury insurance and accidental medical care insurance. Although we require that the third-party transportation companies we engage maintain insurance policies with respect to inland transit risks for our products, the coverage may be inadequate to protect us from potential claims against us and the losses that may result. The occurrence of a significant event for which we are not fully insured or indemnified, and/or the failure of a party to meet its underwriting or indemnification obligations, could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Moreover, no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable.\nOur bank accounts in China are not insured or protected against loss, and the failure of any bank in which we deposit our funds could affect our ability to continue in business.\nWe maintain our cash in China with various national banks located in China. These cash accounts are not insured or otherwise protected against loss. Should any bank holding our cash deposits become insolvent, or if we are otherwise unable to withdraw funds, we would lose the cash on deposit with that particular bank. Depending upon the amount of cash we maintain in a bank that fails, our inability to have access to such cash deposits could impair our operations, and, if we are not able to access funds to pay our suppliers, employees and other creditors, we may be unable to continue in business.\nWe may not be able to protect our product designs and other proprietary rights adequately, which could adversely affect our competitive position and reduce the value of our products and brands, and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights may be costly.\nWe attempt to strengthen and differentiate our product portfolio by developing new and innovative brands and product designs and functionality. As a result, our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important assets to our business. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and protect our products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties in China, the U.S. and other international markets. Despite our efforts, any of the following may reduce the value of our owned and used intellectual property:\n\u25cf\nissued patents and trademarks that we own or have the right to use may not provide us with any competitive advantages;\n\u25cf\nOur efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our intellectual property or that of those from whom we license our rights to use;\n\u25cf\nOur efforts may not prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with, or superior to those we use or develop; or\n\u25cf\nanother party may obtain a blocking patent and we or our licensors would need to either obtain a license or design around the patent in order to continue to offer the contested feature or service in our products.\nEffective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in China or certain other countries. Policing the unauthorized use of our proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive. Litigation might be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights, which may be costly and may divert our management\u2019s attention away from our core business. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that litigation would result in an outcome favorable to us. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights adequately, it would have a negative impact on our operations.\nWe, or the owners of the intellectual property rights licensed to us, may be subject to claims that we or such licensors have infringed the proprietary rights of others, which could require us and our licensors to obtain a license or change designs.\nAlthough we do not believe any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of others, there is no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims (or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims) will not be asserted or prosecuted against us or those from whom we have licenses or that any such assertions or prosecutions will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of whether any such claims are valid or can be asserted successfully, defending against such claims could cause us to incur significant costs and could divert resources away from our other activities. In addition, assertion of infringement claims could result in injunctions that prevent us from distributing our products. If any claims or actions are asserted against us or those from whom we have licenses, we may seek to obtain a license to the intellectual property rights that are in dispute. Such a license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, which could force us to change our designs.\nWe and our subsidiaries may only have a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide and royalty-free license to use certain design patents used in our business, which could require us to litigate or arbitrate to retain such license rights if the licensor contests the license agreement.\nNova Dongguan historically has licensed the right to use certain design patents for our products from our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Wong, who is the sole owner and registrant of these design patents. Mr. Wong agreed to transfer his ownership of the design patents to Nova Dongguan and entered into an agreement in January 2011, as amended, to grant Nova Dongguan a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free and irrevocable license to use the design patents registered in his name until the SIPO approves of the ownership transfer to Nova Dongguan. Any transfer of the ownership of such design patents requires that the transfer agreements be registered with the SIPO and, without such registration, the transfers would not be effective under PRC law. As of December 31, 2011, SIPO has approved the ownership transfer to Nova Dongguan of 30 out of the 116 design patents Mr. Wong intended to transfer to Nova Dongguan. The Company and Mr. Wong expect the transfer process for these 30 design patents to be completed in April 2015. The irrevocable license to use the remaining design patents pending transfer approval may not be canceled by Mr. Wong until ownership of such design patents have been transferred to Nova Dongguan. If Mr. Wong contests the license agreement prior to the effective transfer of ownership of the remaining design patents, our business may be adversely affected as Nova Dongguan may have to litigate or arbitrate to enforce its license rights to such design patents under the license agreement.\nOur business could be subject to environmental liabilities in China, which could result in our incurring significant remediation costs, fines and loss of our business license.\nAs is the case with manufacturers of similar products, we use certain hazardous substances in our operations. Currently, our business is subject to the Environmental Protection Law of the PRC as well as other national and local laws in China regarding pollutant discharge, air, water and noise pollution. Although we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable PRC environmental laws and regulations, if it is determined that we are in violation of these regulations, we could be subject to financial penalties as well as the loss of Nova Dongguan\u2019s business license. Furthermore, if the national or local government in China adopts more stringent environmental regulations, we may incur significant costs in complying with such regulations. If we fail to comply with present or future environmental regulations, we may be required to pay substantial fines and remediation costs, suspend production or cease operations and may be subject to adverse publicity. We currently do not incur any material costs in connection with our compliance with the applicable PRC environmental laws. However, the risk of environmental liability and charges associated with maintaining compliance with PRC environmental laws is inherent in the nature of our business, and there is no assurance that material environmental liabilities and compliance charges will not arise in the future.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of our operating as a public company and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nWhile we are a public company, our compliance costs prior to the acquisition of Nova Furniture were not substantial in light of our limited operations. Nova Furniture and Diamond Bar never operated as public companies prior to our acquisition of them. As a public company with substantial operations, we incur increased legal, accounting and other expenses. The costs of preparing and filing annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to shareholders is time-consuming and costly.\nIt will also be time-consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop and implement the internal controls and reporting procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Certain members of our management have limited or no experience operating a company whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange or with the rules and reporting practices required by the federal securities laws and applicable to a publicly traded company. We will need to recruit, hire, train and retain additional financial reporting, internal control and other personnel in order to develop and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures. If we are unable to comply with the internal controls requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to obtain the independent accountant certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our business and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are required to establish and maintain internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures and to comply with other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules promulgated by the SEC. At present, we have instituted internal controls, but, as discussed below, we are in the process of correcting certain material weaknesses in our internal controls. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all possible errors. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and subject to simple error or mistake. Furthermore, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.\nPrior to our acquisition of Nova Furniture, Diamond Bar and Bright Swallow, Nova Furniture and its subsidiaries, Diamond Bar and Bright Swallow were private operating companies with no experience operating as a public company or establishing the level of internal control over financial reporting required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and Nova LifeStyle, the U.S. parent company, was a non-operating public shell. Prior to June 4, 2013, our Board of Directors lacked independent directors and an audit committee, and we lacked, and currently lack, sufficient accounting personnel with appropriate understanding of the generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP, and SEC reporting requirements, which constitutes a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2014, because of this material weakness. See \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\u201d We have taken, and are taking, certain actions intended to remediate this issue regarding our internal control over financial reporting, including the hiring of an outside Sarbanes-Oxley Act consultant as of March 2012 to assist in testing and improving our internal controls and for the design of effective documented financial accounting policies and procedures for our U.S. parent company and all subsidiaries. As of the date of this filing and during the year ended December 31, 2014, we have taken certain actions to remediate other identified material weaknesses related to our lack of independent directors and an audit committee. We have added independent directors and established an audit committee as a separately designated committee of the Board of Directors with a written charter, as of June 4, 2013. On June 4, 2013 we confirmed Mr. Talevich as an \u201caudit committee financial expert\u201d as defined under Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. While Mr. Talevich notified the Board of Directors on March 8, 2015 that he will not stand for re-election at the next annual meeting of our shareholders, we anticipate that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors will include in its recommended list of nominees for directors an additional independent director with the requisite financial expertise to serve as the audit committee financial expert and to replace Mr. Talevich in his current role as chair of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. We have also started to interview candidates for a Vice President of Finance position, which requires the candidate to have experience in U.S. GAAP and SEC financial reporting. We are still in the process of searching for an acceptable candidate. In addition, we plan to provide additional training to our accounting personnel on U.S. GAAP, and other regulatory requirements regarding the preparation of financial statements. Until such time as we hire qualified accounting personnel with the requisite U.S. GAAP knowledge and experience and train our current accounting personnel, we have engaged an outside CPA with U.S. GAAP knowledge and experience to supplement our current internal accounting personnel and assist us in the preparation of our financial statements to ensure that our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the measures we have taken may not be sufficient to mitigate the foregoing risks associated with the lack of sufficient accounting personnel with appropriate understanding of U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements. We anticipate that these actions have had, and will have, a material impact on our internal control over financial reporting in 2014, and in future periods.\nOur accounting personnel who are primarily responsible for the preparation and supervision of the preparation of our financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. have limited relevant education and training in U.S. GAAP and SEC rules and regulations pertaining to financial reporting, which could impact our ability to prepare our financial statements and convert our books and records to U.S. GAAP.\nOur manufacturing operations are in China and we historically have maintained the books and records of our PRC subsidiaries in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the PRC, or PRC GAAP. Our accounting personnel in the PRC who have the primary responsibilities of preparing and supervising the preparation of financial statements under U.S. GAAP have limited relevant education and training in U.S. GAAP and related SEC rules and regulations. As such, they may be unable to identify potential accounting and disclosure issues that may arise upon the conversion of our books and records from PRC GAAP to U.S. GAAP, which could affect our ability to prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have taken steps to ensure that our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, including our hiring of a U.S. accounting firm to work with our PRC accounting personnel and management to convert our books and records to U.S. GAAP and prepare our financial statements. Until such time as we hire qualified accounting personnel or train our current accounting personnel with the requisite U.S. GAAP experience, however, the measures we have taken may not be sufficient to mitigate the foregoing risks associated with the limited education and training of our accounting personnel in U.S. GAAP and related SEC rules and regulations.\nWe are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our wholly owned subsidiaries to meet our obligations, and any inability of our subsidiaries to pay us dividends or make other payments to us when needed could disrupt or have a negative impact on our business.\nAfter our acquisition of Nova Furniture, we became a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Bright Swallow, Diamond Bar, and Nova Furniture, and Nova Furniture's wholly owned subsidiaries through which we conduct operations: Nova Dongguan, Nova Macao and Nova Museum and Ding Nuo, with each of Nova Museum and Ding Nuo a wholly owned subsidiary of Nova Dongguan. We rely on dividends paid by our subsidiaries for our cash needs, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders, to service any debt we may incur and to pay our operating expenses. China has currency and capital transfer regulations that require us to comply with complex regulations for the movement of capital. PRC regulations currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with accounting standards and regulations in China. Our PRC subsidiaries also are required to set aside at least 10% of net income after taxes based on PRC accounting standards each year to statutory surplus reserves until the cumulative amount of such reserves reaches 50% of registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. Our PRC subsidiaries also may allocate a portion of their after-tax profits to their staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the event of liquidation. Furthermore, if any of our subsidiaries incurs debt, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. Accordingly, if our subsidiaries are unable to pay us dividends and make other payments to us when needed because of regulatory restrictions or otherwise, we may be materially and adversely limited in our ability to make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends or otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nAll of the liabilities of Nova Furniture survived its acquisition by us, and there may be undisclosed liabilities that could have a negative impact on our financial condition.\nBefore our acquisition of Nova Furniture, certain due diligence activities on our company and Nova Furniture were performed by us, our auditors and our attorneys. The due diligence process may not have revealed all liabilities (actual or contingent) of our company and Nova Furniture that existed or which may arise in the future relating to activities before the consummation of our acquisition of Nova Furniture. Notwithstanding that all of our pre-closing liabilities, other than those arising under the return to treasury agreement entered into between us and our former president and director concurrently with the Share Exchange Agreement, were transferred to the seller pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, it is possible that claims for such liabilities may still be made against us, which we will be required to defend or otherwise resolve. The transfer of pre-closing liabilities pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement may not be sufficient to protect us from claims and liabilities, and any breaches of related representations and warranties. Any liabilities remaining from pre-closing activities could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur acquisition of Bright Swallow International Group Limited and Diamond Bar might subject us to unknown liabilities that could have a negative impact on our financial condition.\nBefore our acquisitions of Bright Swallow International Group Limited and Diamond Bar, certain due diligence activities on Bright Swallow and Diamond Bar, respectively, were performed by us. Bright Swallow or Diamond Bar may have unknown liabilities, however, including, but not limited to, product liability, workers\u2019 compensation liability, tax liability and liability for improper business practices. Although we are entitled to indemnification from the seller of Bright Swallow for certain matters, we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations or we could incur material liabilities for the past activities of Bright Swallow. Such liabilities and related legal or other costs could materially harm our business or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms because we became public by means of a share exchange, which could limit our ability to obtain future capital and financing.\nThere may be risks associated with our becoming public by means of a share exchange, or reverse merger with a public shell company that had no revenues, operations or material assets prior to the time of the share exchange. Analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage for our company because there is no incentive for brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. Furthermore, we can give no assurance that brokerage firms will, in the future, want to conduct any secondary offerings on our behalf, which could limit our ability to obtain future capital and financing.\nRisks Related to Business in China\nInflation in China could negatively affect our profitability and growth.\nThe rapid growth of China\u2019s economy has been uneven among economic sectors and geographic regions of the country and has been fueled over the last three years by a large amount of debt issuances. China\u2019s economy grew at an annual rate of 7.4% in 2014, as measured by the year-over-year change in GDP according to the NBS. Rapid economic growth and less restrictive monetary policies can lead to growth in the money supply and rising inflation. According to the NBS, the annual inflation rate in China, as measured by the year-over-year change in consumer price index, was 2.0% as of December 2014, according to the NBS. If prices for our products fail to rise at a rate sufficient to compensate for the increased costs of supplies, such as raw materials, due to inflation, it may have an adverse effect on our profitability, which the Company would attempt to mitigate by reducing the cost with more automated production practices.\nIn order to control inflation in the past, the PRC government has imposed controls on bank credits, limits on loans for fixed assets, restrictions on state bank lending and raised reserve requirements for banks. In particular, in response to inflationary concerns, the PRC government instituted tightened fiscal policies in 2011, including controls on bank reserve requirement ratios, that contributed to a general slowdown in many sectors of China\u2019s economy and restricted bank lending practices. If the PRC government continues its deflationary policies and efforts to stabilize economic growth in China, such disruptions may adversely affect our plans for growth and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, the People\u2019s Bank of China, or the PBOC, which is the central bank of the PRC, has effected several increases in interest rates in response to inflationary concerns in China\u2019s economy. The implementation of such policies may further impede future economic growth. If the PBOC continues to raise interest rates, economic activity in China could further slow and, in turn, materially increase our costs and reduce demand for our products and services.\nThe PRC government has introduced certain policy and regulatory measures to control the rapid increase in housing prices and slow down the real estate market in China, which could affect our business and planned growth in China.\nThe PRC government strictly controls the housing and real estate market in China, which has experienced a strong recovery from the financial crisis since 2009. To control the price of real estate, restrict speculation and break the isolated bubbles in the real estate market in China, the PRC government has tightened its credit loan policies and land right acquisition regulations. In January 2010, the PRC State Council issued a circular, or the January Circular, to control the rapid increase in housing prices and slow down the real estate market in China. The circular notably instructed the PBOC and the China Bank Regulatory Commission to tighten the supervision of bank lending to the real estate sector and mortgage financing and increased the minimum down payment requirements for purchasers of a second residential property. In response, the PBOC increased the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks during the first half of 2010, which had the effect of tightening lending policies. In April 2010, the PRC State Council issued an additional circular, or the April Circular, setting increased minimum down payment and mortgage interest rate requirements for purchasers of first, second and third residential properties. Moreover, this circular provided that banks can decline to provide mortgage financing to purchasers of a third residential property and non-resident purchasers. It is possible that the PRC government agencies may adopt further measures to implement the policies outlined in the January and April Circulars. The full effect of these circulars on the real estate industry and our planned growth in selling and marketing furniture to end consumers in China will depend in large part on the implementation and interpretation of the circulars by PRC governmental agencies, local governments and banks involved in the real estate industry. The PRC government\u2019s policies and regulatory measures on the PRC real estate sector could limit the ability of new apartment and homeowners to obtain mortgage financing or significantly increase the cost of mortgage financing or reduce market demand. We cannot be certain that the PRC government will not issue additional and more stringent regulations or measures or that agencies and banks will not adopt restrictive measures or practices in response to PRC governmental policies and regulations. Our growth strategy includes a planned expansion of our network of product franchise stores in China and the introduction of new product brands designed for the middle class consumer in China. Changes in mortgage and interest rates, new housing starts, existing home sales and the availability of consumer credit in China could have particularly significant effects on consumer demand for furniture in China, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and expansion prospects.\nChanges in China\u2019s political and economic policies could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China, which could reduce the demand for our products and adversely affect our business.\nAll of our manufacturing and productive assets are located in China and a significant percentage of our revenue is derived from our operations in China. Accordingly, our results of operations and prospects are subject to the economic, political and legal developments in China. While China\u2019s economy has experienced significant growth in the past twenty years, such growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may have a negative effect on us. For example, our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by PRC government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. In recent years, the PRC government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform and the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of corporate governance in business enterprises; however, a substantial portion of productive assets in China are still owned by the PRC government. In addition, the PRC government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. It also exercises significant control over China\u2019s economic growth through the allocation of resources, the control of payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, the setting of monetary policy, the control of the housing and real estate market and the provision of preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Any adverse change in the economic conditions or government policies in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth and level of real estate and housing investments and expenditures in China, which in turn could lead to reduced consumer demand for home furnishings and our products and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, changes in policies, laws and regulations or in their interpretation or the imposition of confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, restrictions or prohibitions on dividend payments to shareholders, or devaluations of currency could cause a decline in the price of our common stock, should a market for our common stock ever develop.\nWe may have difficulty establishing adequate management, legal and financial controls in China, which could affect our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely.\nHistorically, China has not adopted an international style of management or financial reporting concepts and practices, nor modern banking, computer and other control systems. We may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified employees to work in China. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices for our subsidiaries in China that meet international standards.\nIf relations between the U.S. and China worsen, our business could be adversely affected and investors may be unwilling to hold or buy our stock and our stock price may decrease.\nAt various times during recent years, the U.S. and China have had significant disagreements over political and economic issues. Controversies may arise in the future between these two countries. Any political or trade controversies between the U.S. and China, whether or not directly related to our business, could reduce the price of our common stock. These controversies also could make it more difficult for us to provide our products to our customers in the U.S. The international trade policies of China and the U.S. could adversely affect our business, and the imposition of trade sanctions relating to imports, taxes, import duties and other charges on imports from China, including those applied specifically to furniture products, or the imposition of taxes, import duties or other charges on exports to the U.S. could increase our costs and decrease our earnings.\nThe nature and application of many laws of China create an uncertain environment for business operations and they could have a negative effect on us.\nThe legal system in China is a civil law system. Unlike the common law system, the civil law system is based on written statutes in which decided legal cases have little value as precedents. In 1979, China began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and has since introduced many laws and regulations to provide general guidance on economic and business practices in China and to regulate foreign investment. Progress has been made in the promulgation of laws and regulations dealing with economic and commercial matters, but these recently enacted laws and regulations may not cover all aspects of business activities in China sufficiently. In particular, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules (some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all) that may have a retroactive effect. As a result, there may be certain instances when we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime after such violation.\nThe PRC government has enacted some laws and regulations dealing with matters such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, commerce, taxation and trade. Our ability to enforce commercial claims or to resolve commercial disputes under these laws and regulations is unpredictable, however, because the implementation, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations is limited and, given their relative newness, involve uncertainties. For example, contracts governed by PRC law tend to contain less detail than those under U.S. law and generally are not as comprehensive in defining the rights and obligations of the contracting parties. Consequently, contracts in China are more vulnerable to disputes and legal challenges than those in the U.S. In addition, contract interpretation and enforcement in China is not as developed as in the U.S., and the result of any contract dispute is subject to significant uncertainties. We currently are not subject to any contract dispute, but we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to future contract disputes with our suppliers, franchisees and other customers under contracts governed by PRC law, and if such disputes arise, we cannot assure you that we will prevail.\nFurthermore, the political, governmental and judicial systems in China are impacted sometimes by corruption. There is no assurance we will be able to obtain recourse in any legal disputes with the suppliers, customers or other parties with whom we conduct business, if desired, through China\u2019s developing and sometimes corrupt judicial systems. Any rights we may have under PRC law to specific performance or to seek an injunction are severely limited, and without a means of recourse by virtue of the PRC legal system, we may be unable to prevent these situations from occurring. The occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIt will be difficult to acquire jurisdiction and enforce liabilities against our assets based in China.\nAs some of our capital assets are based in China, it may be difficult to acquire jurisdiction over these assets in the event a lawsuit is initiated against the Company. In addition, the courts in China may not permit the enforcement of judgments arising out of U.S. federal and state corporate, securities or similar laws. Accordingly, U.S. investors may not be able to enforce judgments against us for violation of U.S. securities laws.\nFluctuation of the Renminbi may affect our financial condition and the value of our securities.\nAlthough we use the USD for financial reporting purposes, transactions effected by two of our subsidiaries in China, Nova Dongguan and Nova Museum, are denominated in RMB. The value of the RMB fluctuates and is subject to changes in China\u2019s political and economic conditions. From June 2008 to June 2010, the RMB was pegged to the USD, but it has since been managed more flexibly. Because the PBOC regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the USD in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future the PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market.\nFuture movements in the exchange rate of the RMB could adversely affect our financial condition as we may suffer financial losses when transferring money raised outside of China into the country or paying vendors for services performed outside of China. Moreover, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the USD and RMB will affect our financial results reported in USD terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business, financial condition or results of operations. The value of our common stock likewise will be affected by the foreign exchange rate between the USD and RMB, and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated. Fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we may issue in the future that will be exchanged into USD and earnings from, and the value of, any USD-denominated investments we make in the future. For example, if we need to convert USD into RMB for our operational needs and the RMB appreciates against the USD at that time, our financial position, our business and the price of our common stock may be harmed. Conversely, if we decide to convert our RMB into USD for the purpose of declaring dividends on our common stock or for other business purposes and the USD appreciates against the RMB, the USD equivalent of our earnings from our subsidiaries in China would be reduced.\nPRC regulations relating to mergers, offshore companies and PRC shareholders, if applied to us, may limit our ability to operate our business as we see fit.\nPRC regulations govern the process by which we may participate in an acquisition of assets or equity interests. Depending on the structure of the transaction, these regulations require involved parties to make a series of applications and supplemental applications to various government agencies. In some instances, the application process may require the presentation of economic data concerning a transaction, including appraisals of the target business and evaluations of the acquirer, which are designed to allow the government to assess the transaction. Government approvals will have expiration dates by which a transaction must be completed and reported to the government agencies. Compliance with the new regulations is likely to be more time consuming and expensive than in the past and the government can now exert more control over the combination of two businesses. Accordingly, due to PRC regulations, our ability to engage in business combination transactions in China through our subsidiaries has become significantly more complicated, time consuming and expensive, and we may not be able to negotiate transactions that are acceptable to us or sufficiently protective of our interests.\nRestrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our revenues effectively.\nThe RMB is currently convertible under the \u201ccurrent account,\u201d which includes dividends, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the \u201ccapital account,\u201d which includes foreign direct investment and loans. Currently, our subsidiaries in China may purchase foreign currencies for settlement of current account transactions, including payments of dividends to us, without the approval of the SAFE. However, the relevant PRC government authorities may limit or eliminate their ability to purchase foreign currencies in the future. Since a significant amount of our future revenues will be denominated in RMB, any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize revenues generated in RMB to fund our business activities outside China that are denominated in foreign currencies.\nOn August 29, 2008, the SAFE promulgated the Notice on Perfecting Practices Concerning Foreign Exchange Settlement Regarding the Capital Contribution by Foreign-invested Enterprises, or Circular 142, to regulate the conversion by FIEs of foreign currency into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. Circular 142 requires that RMB converted from the foreign currency-dominated capital of a FIE may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC unless specifically provided for otherwise. In addition, the SAFE strengthened its oversight over the flow and use of RMB funds converted from the foreign currency-dominated capital of a FIE. The use of such RMB may not be changed without approval from the SAFE, and may not be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not yet been used. These limitations could affect the ability of our subsidiaries in China to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing.\nPRC regulations relating to the registration requirements for PRC resident shareholders owning shares in offshore companies may subject our PRC resident shareholders to personal liability and limit our ability to acquire companies in China or to inject capital into our operating subsidiaries in China, limit our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to distribute profits to us or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe SAFE issued a public notice in October 2005, Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents\u2019 Corporate Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles, which we refer to as Circular 75, requiring PRC residents, including both legal persons and natural persons, to register with the competent local SAFE branch before establishing or controlling any company outside of China, referred to as an \u201coffshore special purpose company,\u201d for the purpose of acquiring any assets of or equity interest in PRC companies and raising funds from overseas. In addition, any PRC resident who is the shareholder of an offshore special purpose company is required to amend his or her SAFE registration with the local SAFE branch, with respect to that offshore special purpose company in connection with any increase or decrease of capital, transfer of shares, merger, division, equity investment or creation of any security interest over any assets located in China. If any PRC resident who is the shareholder of an offshore special purpose company fails to comply with the SAFE registration requirements, the PRC subsidiaries of the offshore special purpose company may be prohibited from distributing their profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to their offshore parent company and the offshore parent company may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiaries. Moreover, failure to comply with the SAFE registration requirements could result in liabilities under PRC laws for evasion of foreign exchange restrictions. We cannot predict fully how Circular 75 will affect our business operations or future strategies because of ongoing uncertainty over how Circular 75 is interpreted and implemented, and how or whether SAFE will apply it to us.\nWe have requested our PRC resident beneficial owners, including our Chief Executive Officer, to make the necessary applications, filings and amendments as required under SAFE regulations in connection with their equity interests in us. We attempt to ensure that our subsidiaries in China comply, and that our PRC resident beneficial owners subject to these rules comply, with the relevant SAFE regulations. We cannot provide any assurances that all of our present or prospective direct or indirect PRC resident beneficial owners will comply fully with all applicable registrations or required approvals. The failure or inability of our PRC resident beneficial owners to comply with the applicable SAFE registration requirements may subject these beneficial owners or us to fines, legal sanctions and restrictions described above.\nPRC labor laws may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOn June 29, 2007, the PRC government promulgated the Labor Contract Law of the PRC, effective on January 1, 2008, to govern the establishment of employment relationships between employers and employees, and the conclusion, performance, termination of and the amendment to employment contracts. The Labor Contract Law imposes greater liabilities on employers and significantly affects the cost of an employer\u2019s decision to reduce its workforce. Further, it requires that certain terminations be based upon seniority and not merit. In the event we decide to significantly change or decrease our workforce in China, the Labor Contract Law could adversely affect our ability to effect such changes in a manner that is most advantageous to our business or in a timely and cost-effective manner, thus materially and adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.\nTransactions between Nova Dongguan and Nova Macao may be subject to audit or challenge by PRC and U.S. tax authorities, and a finding that we owe additional taxes could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to income tax in the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Under PRC and U.S. laws and regulations, transactions among affiliated parties may be subject to audit or challenge by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions. We could face material and adverse tax consequences if the PRC or U.S. tax authorities determine that transactions between Nova Dongguan and Nova Macao do not represent arm\u2019s-length prices and, as a result, adjust any of the income in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment. A transfer pricing adjustment could, among other things, result in a reduction of expense deductions for PRC tax purposes recorded by our PRC subsidiaries or an increase in taxable income, all of which could increase our tax liabilities. In addition, the PRC or U.S. tax authorities may impose late payment fees and other penalties on us or our PRC subsidiaries for under-paid taxes. Management assesses our potential liabilities related to this issue on a quarterly basis, and we have taken an additional income tax expense as a reserve based on management\u2019s analysis for estimated tax principle, interest and penalties under both PRC and U.S. transfer pricing regulations. To the extent that any PRC or U.S. tax authority disagrees with our transfer pricing policies or appropriateness of our tax provision, we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nUnder the Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be classified as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d of China. Such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC resident shareholders.\nChina passed the Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, and its implementing rules, both of which became effective on January 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d within China is considered a \u201cresident enterprise,\u201d meaning that it must be treated as a PRC domestic enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the EIT Law define de facto management as \u201csubstantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties\u201d of the enterprise.\nOn April 22, 2009, the SAT issued the Notice Concerning Relevant Issues Regarding Cognizance of Chinese Investment Controlled Enterprises Incorporated Offshore as Resident Enterprises pursuant to Criteria of de facto Management Bodies, or the Notice, further interpreting the application of the EIT Law and its implementation regarding non-PRC enterprise or group controlled offshore entities. Pursuant to the Notice, an enterprise incorporated in an off-shore jurisdiction and controlled by a PRC enterprise or group will be classified as a \u201cnon-domestically incorporated resident enterprise\u201d if: (i) its senior management in charge of daily operations reside or perform their duties mainly in China; (ii) its financial or personnel decisions are made or approved by bodies or persons in China; (iii) its substantial assets and properties, accounting books, corporate chops, board and shareholder minutes are kept in China; and (iv) at least half of its directors with voting rights or senior management often reside in China. A \u201cresident enterprise\u201d would be subject to an enterprise income tax rate of 25% on its worldwide income and must pay a withholding tax at a rate of 10% when paying dividends to its non-PRC shareholders. However, detailed measures on imposition of tax from non-domestically incorporated resident enterprises are not yet available. Therefore, it is unclear how tax authorities will determine tax residency based on the facts of each case.\nWe may be deemed to be a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d by PRC tax authorities. If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow. First, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. In our case, this would mean that income such as interest on financing proceeds and non-China source income would be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Second, although under the EIT Law and its implementing rules dividends paid to us from our PRC subsidiaries would qualify as \u201ctax-exempt income,\u201d we cannot guarantee that such dividends will not be subject to a 10% withholding tax, as the PRC foreign exchange control authorities, which enforce the withholding tax, have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as \u201cresident enterprises\u201d for PRC enterprise income tax purposes. Finally, it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the new \u201cresident enterprise\u201d classification could result in a situation in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC shareholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC shareholders from transferring our shares. If we were treated as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d by PRC tax authorities, we would be subject to taxation in both the U.S. and China, and our PRC tax may not be creditable against our U.S. tax.\nDividends distributed by us to our non-PRC resident shareholders may be subject to PRC withholding taxes.\nBefore the EIT Law came into effect on January 1, 2008, dividends paid to foreign investors by FIEs, such as dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries in China, were exempt from PRC withholding tax. We are a Nevada holding company and substantially all of our income is derived from dividends we receive from our subsidiaries, including those in China. Pursuant to the EIT Law, dividends generated after January 1, 2008, and distributed to us by our subsidiaries in China are subject to withholding tax at a rate of 5%, provided that we are determined by the relevant PRC tax authorities to be a \u201cnon-resident enterprise\u201d under the EIT Law and hold at least 25% of the equity interest of our subsidiaries. If we are determined to be a \u201cresident enterprise,\u201d we cannot guarantee that such dividends will not be subject to a 10% withholding tax, as the PRC foreign exchange control authorities, which enforce the withholding tax, have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as \u201cresident enterprises\u201d for PRC enterprise income tax purposes. In addition, it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the new \u201cresident enterprise\u201d classification could result in a situation in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC shareholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC shareholders from transferring our shares.\nThe SAT promulgated \u201cNotice on How to Understand and Determine the Beneficial Owners in Tax Agreement\u201d on October 27, 2009, or SAT Circular 601, which provides guidance for determining whether a resident of a contracting state is the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of an item of income under China\u2019s tax treaties and tax arrangements. According to SAT Circular 601, a beneficial owner generally must be engaged in substantive business activities. An agent or conduit company will not be regarded as a beneficial owner and, therefore, will not qualify for treaty benefits. The agent or conduit company normally refers to a company that is registered in a jurisdiction other than China and merely meets the minimum legal requirements on organizational form and is not engaged in substantive operational activities for manufacturing, distribution or management. It is still unclear how SAT Circular 601 is implemented by SAT or its local counterparts in practice and whether we could be recognized as a \u201cbeneficial owner.\u201d If we are deemed a non-resident enterprise but not qualified as a beneficial owner, we will not be entitled to a reduced 5% withholding tax and the 10% withholding tax would be imposed on our dividend income received from our subsidiaries. As a result, our net income would be reduced and our operating results would be adversely affected.\nOur compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act may put us at a competitive disadvantage, while our failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act may result in substantial penalties.\nWe are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Although we inform our personnel that such practices are illegal, we cannot assure you that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties. Non-U.S. companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to the provisions of the FCPA. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time to time in mainland China. If our competitors engage in these practices, they may receive preferential treatment from personnel of some companies, giving our competitors an advantage in securing business or from government officials who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses, which would put us at a disadvantage.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile, which could make it more difficult or impossible for an investor to sell our common stock for a positive return on their investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but not limited to, our quarterly operating results or the operating results of other companies in our industry, announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new products, product improvements, commercial relationships, intellectual property, legal, regulatory or other business developments and changes in financial estimates or recommendations by stock market analysts regarding us or our competitors. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for companies with substantial operations based in China or that became public by means of a reverse acquisition with a public shell company in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated or disproportionate to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may materially affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results. Furthermore, the market for our common stock historically has been limited and we cannot assure you that a larger market will ever be developed or maintained. Market fluctuations and volatility, as well as general economic, market and political conditions, could reduce our market price. As a result, these factors may make it more difficult or impossible for you to sell our common stock for a positive return on your investment.\nShares of our common stock lack a significant trading market, which could make it more difficult for an investor to sell our common stock.\nOur common stock began trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC on January 17, 2014, however, there is no assurance that an active trading market in our common stock will develop, or if such a market develops, that it will be sustained. As a result, an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of our common stock.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock by our shareholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our stock. As of March 23, 2015, Messrs. Wong, our Chief Executive Officer, and Ho, our Chief Financial Officer, our two largest shareholders, owned 23% and 19%, respectively, of our outstanding shares of common stock. If our significant shareholders sell a large number of shares, or if we issue a large number of shares, the market price of our stock could decline. Moreover, the perception in the public market that shareholders might sell shares of our stock could depress the market for our shares. Our management and certain of our other significant shareholders who received shares of our common stock issued pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement are subject to lockup agreements that prohibit their sale of all shares of our common stock held currently or acquired by them in the future to the general public until the earliest to occur of (i) three years following the date the Company\u2019s securities are listed on a registered national securities exchange or (ii) if the closing of an offering does not occur within one year from the date of the Lock-Up Agreements, which were entered into in June and August 2011, then two years from the date the lockup agreements. On March 25, 2014, the Company and Lock-Up Holders entered into the First Amendment to the Lock-Up Agreements and added a new provision in the lock up period paragraph to clarify that if the closing of an offering does occur within one year from the date of the Agreements, then the lock-up period will automatically terminate upon three years from the date of the Agreements.\nThese lockup agreements terminated in June and August of 2014. As a result, if such shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, such sales could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an \u201coverhang,\u201d in anticipation of which the market price of our common stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock or debt securities to raise capital or complete acquisitions, which would reduce the equity interest of our shareholders.\nOur Articles of Incorporation, as amended, authorize the issuance of up to 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share. As of March 23, 2015, there were 52,946,575, authorized and unissued shares of our common stock available for future issuance, based on 20,940,513 shares of our common stock outstanding and our reservation of 1,112,912 shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants. Although we have no commitments as of the date of this report to issue our securities, we may issue a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock or debt securities to complete a business combination or to raise capital. On February 20, 2014, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 under which the Company may, from time to time, sell securities in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of $60,000,000. The shelf registration statement was declared effective as of March 7, 2014 and expires on March 6, 2017.\nOn April 14, 2014, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain purchasers pursuant to which the Company sold to the Buyers, in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 1,320,059 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at a negotiated purchase price of $6.78 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $8.95 million.\nAs part of the transaction, the Buyers also received (i) Series A warrants to purchase up to 660,030 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate at an exercise price of $8.48 per share (the \u201cSeries A Warrants\u201d); (ii) Series B warrants to purchase up to 633,628 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate at an exercise price of $6.82 per share (the \u201cSeries B Warrants\u201d); and (iii) Series C warrants to purchase up to 310,478 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate at an exercise price of $8.53 per share (the \u201cSeries C Warrants\u201d and together with the Series A Warrants and the Series B Warrants, the \u201cWarrants\u201d). The Series A Warrants have a term of four years and are exercisable by the holders at any time after the date of issuance. The Series B Warrants have a term of six months and are exercisable by the holders at any time after the date of issuance. The Series C Warrants have a term of four years and are exercisable by the holders at any time after the date of issuance. After the six month anniversary of the issuance date of the Series C Warrants, to the extent that a holder of a Series C Warrant exercises less than 70% of such holder\u2019s Series B Warrants and the closing sale price of the Common Stock is equal to or greater than $9.81 for a period of ten consecutive trading days, then the Company may purchase the entire then-remaining portion of such holder\u2019s Series C Warrants for $1,000. The shares and warrants were registered on a takedown of our shelf registration statement described below. The series B Warrants expired on October 14, 2014, and none of the Series B warrants were excised prior to such expiration.\nThe issuance of additional shares of our common stock may significantly reduce the equity interest of our existing shareholders and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nThe application of the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and increase the transaction costs to investors who sell those shares.\nOur common stock may be subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules adopted under Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act. The penny stock rules apply to issuers whose common stock does not trade on a national securities exchange and trades at less than $5.00 per share, or that have a tangible net worth of less than $5,000,000 ($2,000,000 if the company has been operating for three or more years). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC that contains the following information:\n\u25cf\nA description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading;\n\u25cf\nA description of the broker\u2019s or dealer\u2019s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to violation to such duties or other requirements of securities laws\n\u25cf\na brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including \u201cbid\u201d and \u201cask\u201d prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the \u201cbid\u201d and \u201cask\u201d prices;\n\u25cf\nA toll free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions;\n\u25cf\nDefinitions of any significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and\n\u25cf\nSuch other information and is in such form (including language, type, size and format), as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation.\nPrior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the broker-dealer also must provide the customer with the following information:\n\u25cf\nBid and offer quotations for the penny stock;\n\u25cf\nCompensation of the broker-dealer and our salesperson in the transaction;\n\u25cf\nNumber of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and\n\u25cf\nMonthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account.\nThe penny stock rules further require that, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement.\nDue to the requirements of the penny stock rules, many broker-dealers have decided not to trade penny stocks. As a result, the number of broker-dealers willing to act as market makers in such securities is limited. If we remain subject to the penny stock rules for any significant period, it could have an adverse effect on the market, if any, for our securities. Moreover, if our securities are subject to the penny stock rules, investors will find it more difficult to dispose of our securities.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting it at such time as the Board of Directors may consider relevant. Furthermore, China has currency and capital transfer regulations that require us to comply with complex regulations for the movement of capital and restrict the amount of capital available for distribution as dividends from our subsidiaries in China. See \u201cRisks Related to Our Business - We are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our wholly owned subsidiaries to meet our obligations, and any inability of our subsidiaries to pay us dividends or make other payments to us when needed could disrupt or have a negative impact on our business.\u201d Although our management believes we are in compliance with these regulations, should these regulations or their interpretation by PRC courts or regulatory agencies change, we may not be able to pay dividends to our shareholders outside of China. Our management intends to follow a policy of retaining all of our earnings to finance the development and execution of our strategy and the expansion of our business. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will occur only if our stock price appreciates.\nOur principal shareholders have the ability to exert significant control in matters requiring a shareholder vote and could delay, deter or prevent a change of control in our company.\nAs of March 23, 2015, Messrs. Wong, our Chief Executive Officer, and Ho, our Chief Financial Officer, our two largest shareholders, owned 23% and 19%, respectively, of our outstanding shares of common stock. Together and individually, Messrs. Wong and Ho exert significant influence over us, giving them the ability, among other things, to exercise significant control over the election of all or a majority of the Board of Directors and to approve significant corporate transactions. Such share ownership and control may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a future change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company. Without the consent of Messrs. Wong and Ho, we could be prevented from entering into potentially beneficial transactions if such transactions conflict with our principal shareholders\u2019 interests. The interests of Messrs. Wong and Ho may differ from the interests of our other shareholders.\nProvisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Amended and Restated Bylaws could make it very difficult for an investor to bring any legal actions against our directors or officers for violations of their fiduciary duties or could require us to pay any amounts incurred by our directors or officers in any such actions.\nMembers of our Board of Directors and our officers will have no liability for breaches of their fiduciary duty of care as a director or officer, except in limited circumstances, pursuant to provisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Amended and Restated Bylaws as authorized by the Nevada Revised Statutes. Specifically, Section 78.138 of the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that a director or officer is not individually liable to the company or its shareholders or creditors for any damages as a result of any act or failure to act in his or her capacity as a director or officer unless it is proven that (1) the director\u2019s or officer\u2019s act or failure to act constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties as a director or officer and (2) his or her breach of those duties involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law. This provision is intended to afford directors and officers protection against and to limit their potential liability for monetary damages resulting from suits alleging a breach of the duty of care by a director or officer. Accordingly, you may be unable to prevail in a legal action against our directors or officers even if they have breached their fiduciary duty of care. In addition, our Amended and Restated Bylaws allow us to indemnify our directors and officers from and against any and all costs, charges and expenses resulting from their acting in such capacities with us. This means that if you were able to enforce an action against our directors or officers, in all likelihood, we would be required to pay any expenses they incurred in defending the lawsuit and any judgment or settlement they otherwise would be required to pay. Accordingly, our indemnification obligations could divert needed financial resources and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14435, "SIC": 2510, "TIC": "NVFY"}
