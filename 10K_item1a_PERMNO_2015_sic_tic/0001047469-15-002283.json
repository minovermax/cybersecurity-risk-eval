RISK FACTORS\nWe have identified the following additional risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. Our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations or financial condition could suffer, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Need for Additional Financing\nWe have incurred losses since inception, and we anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $494.8 million. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $39.4 million. We expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our clinical development activities and potentially seek regulatory approval of our product candidates. These losses, among other things, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders' equity and working capital.\nOur current product candidates, enobosarm (GTx-024) and GTx-758 (Capesaris\u00ae), will require significant additional clinical development, financial resources and personnel in order to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for these product candidates and to develop them into commercially viable products. A substantial portion of our efforts and expenditures have been devoted to enobosarm 3 mg, which was the subject of our POWER 1 and POWER 2 Phase 3 clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. The failure of the POWER trials to meet the primary statistical criterion for the co-primary endpoints agreed upon with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, significantly depressed our stock price and has harmed our future prospects. Although we evaluated the potential submission of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, seeking marketing approval of enobosarm 3 mg in the European Union, or EU, for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with advanced NSCLC, based on input from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, we believe that the data from the POWER trials is not sufficient to support the filing and approval of a MAA without confirmatory data from another Phase 3 clinical trial of enobosarm 3 mg. As a result of this input, we do not intend to submit a MAA in the absence of such confirmatory data. In addition, since data from the two POWER trials failed to meet the primary statistical criterion pre-specified for the co-primary endpoints of lean body mass and physical function, the FDA will not accept a new drug application, or NDA, for enobosarm 3 mg for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with advanced NSCLC. Accordingly, our strategy does not currently include further development of enobosarm for this indication in the U.S. or in Europe unless such development is part of a collaborative arrangement or strategic partnership. Moreover, our current strategy is focused on the further development of enobosarm for the treatment of patients with androgen receptor, or AR, positive advanced breast cancer. However, the development of enobosarm for the treatment of patients with AR positive advanced breast cancer is at an early stage and is subject to the substantial risk of failure inherent in the development of early-stage product candidates.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing small molecule drugs, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all. In addition, we do not expect to obtain FDA or EMA approval, or any other\nregulatory approvals, to market any of our product candidates, including enobosarm, for the foreseeable future, and it is possible that none of our product candidates will ever receive any regulatory approvals.\nWe have funded our operations primarily through public offerings and private placements of our securities, as well as payments from our former collaborators. We also previously recognized product revenue from the sale of FARESTON\u00ae, the rights to which we sold to a third party in the third quarter of 2012. Currently, we have no ongoing collaborations for the development and commercialization of our product candidates, and as a result of the sale of our rights and certain assets related to FARESTON\u00ae, we also currently have no sources of revenue.\nIf we and/or any potential collaborators are unable to develop and commercialize enobosarm or GTx-758, if development is further delayed or is eliminated, or if sales revenue from enobosarm or GTx-758 upon receiving marketing approval, if ever, is insufficient, we may never become profitable and we will not be successful.\nWe will need to raise substantial additional capital and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs and could cause us to discontinue our operations.\nWe will need to raise substantial additional capital to:\n\u2022 fund our operations and conduct clinical trials;\n\u2022 continue our research and development;\n\u2022 seek regulatory approval for our product candidates; and\n\u2022 commercialize our product candidates, if any such product candidates receive regulatory approval for commercial sale.\nWe estimate that our current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with interest thereon, will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements through the end of 2016 (during which time we expect, at a minimum, to obtain results from patients enrolled in stage one of each of our planned open-label Phase 2 clinical trials of enobosarm in patients with AR positive advanced breast cancer, using a Simon's two-stage clinical trial design). While we estimate that our current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are sufficient to fund our operations through 2016, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding to commence and complete stage two of both of our planned open-label Phase 2 clinical trials of enobosarm in patients with AR positive advanced breast cancer and to otherwise seek regulatory approval for enobosarm in patients with AR positive advanced breast cancer. In addition, if we decide to undertake any further development of GTx-758 and/or enobosarm beyond our ongoing and currently-planned clinical trials, we would need to obtain additional funding for such development, either through financing or by entering into collaborative arrangements or partnerships with third parties for such further development.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022 the scope, rate of progress and cost of our clinical development programs, including our ongoing, planned and any future clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022 the terms and timing of any potential collaborative, licensing and other strategic arrangements that we may establish;\n\u2022 the amount and timing of any licensing fees, milestone payments and royalty payments from potential collaborators, if any;\n\u2022 future clinical trial results, if any;\n\u2022 the cost and timing of regulatory filings and/or approvals to commercialize our product candidates and any related restrictions, limitations, and/or warnings in the label of an approved product candidate;\n\u2022 the effect of competing technological and market developments; and\n\u2022 the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights, and the cost of defending any other litigation claims.\nWhile we have been able to fund our operations to date, we currently have no ongoing collaborations for the development and commercialization of our product candidates and no source of revenue, nor do we expect to generate revenue for the foreseeable future. We also do not have any commitments for future external funding. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue, which we may never do, we expect to finance future cash needs through potential collaboration, partnering or other strategic arrangements, as well as through public or private equity offerings or debt financings, or a combination of the foregoing. In October 2013, following our announcement that the POWER trials failed to achieve the results required by the FDA for us to submit a NDA for enobosarm, we announced and implemented a workforce reduction of approximately 60%. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may need to further reduce our expenditures, perhaps significantly, to preserve our cash. Cost-cutting measures that we may take in the future may not be sufficient to enable use to meet our cash requirements, and they may negatively affect our business and growth prospects.\nTo the extent that we raise additional funds through potential collaboration, partnering or other strategic arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, any of which could result in the stockholders of GTx having little or no continuing interest in our enobosarm and/or GTx-758 programs as stockholders or otherwise. To the extent we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution, particularly given our currently depressed stock price, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. For example, we completed a private placement of common stock and warrants in March 2014, which was substantially dilutive, and completed a subsequent private placement in November 2014 that represented even greater dilution, and our stockholders may experience additional, perhaps substantial, dilution should we again raise additional funds by issuing equity securities. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. Our ability to raise additional funds and the terms upon which we are able to raise such funds have been severely harmed by the failure of the two enobosarm Phase 3 clinical trials to meet both of the co-primary endpoints agreed upon with the FDA, and may in the future be adversely impacted by the uncertainty regarding the prospects of our planned development of enobosarm for the treatment of patients with AR positive advanced breast cancer and our ability to advance the development of enobosarm and GTx-758, if at all. Our ability to raise additional funds and the terms upon which we are able to raise such funds may also be adversely affected by the uncertainties regarding our financial condition, the sufficiency of our capital resources, our ability to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market or another\nmarket tier of the NASDAQ Stock Market and recent and potential future management turnover. As a result of these and other factors, we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available when we need them, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs, including our enobosarm and GTx-758 programs, or conduct additional workforce or other expense reductions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our prospects.\nRisks Related to Development of Product Candidates\nWe are substantially dependent on the success of enobosarm and our failure to advance the development of enobosarm or to obtain regulatory approval of enobosarm would significantly harm our prospects.\nOur current strategy is focused on the further development of enobosarm for the treatment of patients with AR positive advanced breast cancer. However, the development of enobosarm for the treatment of patients with AR positive advanced breast cancer is at an early stage and is subject to the significant risk of failure inherent in the development of early-stage product candidates. Moreover, we still have only limited data from our preclinical models of breast cancer and our ongoing Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial of enobosarm in women with ER positive and AR positive metastatic breast cancer. As a result, we will need to conduct additional clinical trials of enobosarm for the treatment of patients with AR positive advanced breast cancer to determine whether enobosarm is an effective treatment for patients with advanced AR positive TNBC and ER positive and AR positive advanced breast cancer. Additionally, if it is determined that enobosarm treatment is not superior to existing approved therapies for advanced breast cancer, or has an unacceptable safety profile, any regulatory approval of enobosarm could be denied or significantly delayed in this patient population.\nPreclinical studies, including studies of SARMs in animal models of disease, may not accurately predict the results of subsequent human clinical trials of enobosarm, including the results our two planned Phase 2 clinical trials of enobosarm in patients with AR positive advanced breast cancer. Furthermore, the positive results from our ongoing Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial of enobosarm in women with ER positive and AR positive metastatic breast cancer does not ensure that our two planned Phase 2 clinical trials will be successful or that any later trials will be successful. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including us and those with greater resources and experience than we have, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 3 and later-stage clinical trials, even after receiving encouraging results in earlier clinical trials. Due to the uncertain and time-consuming clinical development and regulatory approval process, we may not be successful in developing enobosarm for the treatment of patients with AR positive advanced breast cancer, or in developing any of our product candidates, and it is possible that none of our current product candidates will ever become commercial products.\nA substantial portion of our efforts and expenditures have been devoted to enobosarm 3 mg, which was the subject of our POWER 1 and POWER 2 Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating enobosarm 3 mg for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with advanced NSCLC. We announced in August 2013 that these two Phase 3 clinical trials failed to meet the co-primary endpoints of lean body mass and physical function that were assessed statistically using responder analyses as required by the FDA. The failure of the POWER trials to meet the primary statistical criterion for the co-primary endpoints agreed upon with the FDA significantly depressed our stock price and has harmed our future prospects. Although we evaluated the potential submission of a MAA to the EMA seeking marketing approval of enobosarm 3 mg in the EU for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with advanced NSCLC, based on recent input from the MHRA, we believe that the data from the POWER trials is not sufficient to support the filing and approval of a MAA without confirmatory data\nfrom another Phase 3 clinical trial of enobosarm 3 mg. As a result of this input, we do not intend to submit a MAA in the absence of such confirmatory data. In addition, since data from the two POWER trials failed to meet the primary statistical criterion pre-specified for the co-primary endpoints of lean body mass and physical function, the FDA will not accept a NDA for enobosarm 3 mg for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with advanced NSCLC. Accordingly, our strategy does not currently include further development of enobosarm for this indication in the U.S. or in Europe unless such development is part of a collaborative arrangement or strategic partnership.\nWe and any potential collaborators will not be able to commercialize our product candidates if our preclinical studies do not produce successful results or if our clinical trials do not adequately demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans.\nSignificant additional clinical development and financial resources will be required to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for our product candidates and to develop them into commercially viable products. Preclinical and clinical testing is expensive, can take many years to complete and has an uncertain outcome. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Typically, the failure rate for development candidates is high. If a product candidate fails at any stage of development, we will not have the anticipated revenues from that product candidate to fund our operations, and we will not receive any return on our investment in that product candidate. For example, we announced in August 2013 that our POWER 1 and POWER 2 Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating enobosarm for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with advanced NSCLC failed to meet the co-primary endpoints of lean body mass and physical function that were assessed statistically using responder analyses as agreed upon with the FDA. Although we evaluated the potential submission of a MAA to the EMA seeking marketing approval of enobosarm 3 mg in the EU for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with advanced NSCLC, based on recent input from the MHRA, we believe that the data from the POWER trials is not sufficient to support the filing and approval of a MAA without confirmatory data from another Phase 3 clinical trial of enobosarm 3 mg. As a result of this input, we do not intend to submit a MAA in the absence of such confirmatory data. In addition, since data from the two POWER trials failed to meet the primary statistical criterion pre-specified for the co-primary endpoints of lean body mass and physical function, the FDA will not accept a NDA for enobosarm 3 mg for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with advanced NSCLC. Accordingly, our strategy does not currently include further development of enobosarm for this indication in the U.S. or in Europe unless such development is part of a collaborative arrangement or strategic partnership.\nSignificant delays in clinical testing could materially impact our product development costs. We do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, or whether ongoing clinical trials will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, if at all. For example, we have not yet received the necessary regulatory approvals to initiate our two planned Phase 2 clinical trials of enobosarm in patients with AR positive advanced breast cancer and it is possible that the initiation of these planned Phase 2 clinical trials may be delayed, perhaps substantially, or precluded altogether as a result of our inability to obtain these approvals. In this regard, we are planning to evaluate a higher dose of enobosarm than the previously evaluated 9 mg dose in both of the planned Phase 2 clinical trials. Accordingly, regulatory authorities, including the FDA, may require us to provide additional preclinical or clinical data prior to initiating the planned Phase 2 clinical trials, which could substantially increase our costs and delay the initiation of these trials. Moreover, both of the planned Phase 2 clinical trials are designed to be conducted using a Simon's two-stage design, pursuant to which we plan to enroll approximately half of the patients in the first stage, and, upon achievement of a pre-specified minimal response rate, we plan to proceed with enrollment of the second stage. However, even if we achieve the pre-specified minimal response rate, our ability to proceed with enrollment of and to complete the\nsecond stage in both trials is subject to our ability to obtain additional funding, which we may be unable to do. In any event, we or any potential collaborators may experience numerous unforeseen and/or adverse events during, or as a result of, preclinical testing and the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent our or our potential collaborators' ability to commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u2022 regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or any potential collaborators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site, or we may experience substantial delays in obtaining these authorizations;\n\u2022 preclinical or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, which may require us or any potential collaborators to conduct additional preclinical or clinical testing or to abandon projects that we expect to be promising;\n\u2022 even if preclinical or clinical trial results are positive, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could nonetheless require us to conduct unanticipated additional clinical trials;\n\u2022 registration or enrollment in clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, resulting in significant delays or study terminations;\n\u2022 we or any potential collaborators may suspend or terminate clinical trials if the participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022 regulators or institutional review boards may suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022 our product candidates may not have the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects.\nIf any of these events were to occur and, as a result, we or any potential collaborators have significant delays in or termination of clinical trials, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be impaired, which would materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and growth prospects.\nIf we or any potential collaborators observe serious or other adverse events during the time our product candidates are in development or after our products are approved and on the market, we or any potential collaborators may be required to perform lengthy additional clinical trials, may be required to cease further development of such product candidates, may be denied regulatory approval of such products, may be forced to change the labeling of such products or may be required to withdraw any such products from the market, any of which would hinder or preclude our ability to generate revenues.\nIn three Phase 2 clinical trials of GTx-758, which we discontinued in February 2012, we observed venous thromboembolic events, or blood clots, in subjects treated with GTx-758 at the doses then being studied in these clinical trials (1000 mg and higher per day) and reported those events to the FDA. There were two deaths in subjects treated with GTx-758 and two deaths in subjects treated with Lupron Depot\u00ae. In February 2012, the FDA placed all of our then ongoing clinical studies of GTx-758 on full clinical hold, and we suspended further enrollment into these studies and notified clinical sites to discontinue treatment of subjects with GTx-758. In May 2012, the FDA notified us that it had removed the full clinical hold on GTx-758. In the third quarter of 2012, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate GTx-758, at doses lower than those which were previously being tested in our discontinued Phase 2 clinical trials, as secondary hormonal therapy in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, or CRPC. Although our current Phase 2 clinical trial is evaluating GTx-758 at doses\nlower than those which were previously being tested in our discontinued Phase 2 clinical trials, we cannot be confident that we will not observe an unacceptable incidence of venous thromboembolic events or other adverse events in the current Phase 2 clinical trial. In this regard, there has been one reported incidence of a VTE in a patient enrolled in the 250 mg arm of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of GTx-758, resulting in his discontinuation from active treatment, and we cannot assure you that we will not observe an unacceptable incidence of VTEs in this trial. Our ability to develop GTx-758 as an effective secondary hormonal therapy for men with metastatic CRPC or, potentially, as a secondary hormonal treatment for advanced prostate cancer used in combination with ADT, is dependent on both our ability to obtain additional funding and our ability to find an appropriate dose that is both effective and safe for these patient populations. If an unacceptable incidence of venous thromboembolic events or other adverse events are observed in our current Phase 2 clinical trial of GTx-758, we may be required to abandon our development of GTx-758, in which case, we would not receive any return on our investment in that product candidate.\nIn our Phase 2 clinical trials for enobosarm for the treatment of muscle wasting in patients with cancer and healthy older males and postmenopausal females, we observed mild elevations of hepatic enzymes, which in certain circumstances may lead to liver failure, in a few patients in both the placebo and enobosarm treated groups. Reductions in high-density lipoproteins, or HDL, have also been observed in subjects treated with enobosarm. Lower levels of HDL could lead to increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. In addition, in our ongoing Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating enobosarm in a 9 mg daily dose for the treatment of patients with ER positive and AR positive metastatic breast cancer, a serious adverse event, bone pain of the chest cage, was assessed as possibly related to enobosarm. Bone pain could be attributed to tumor flare, which is an increase in tumor activity usually seen with endocrine therapies. Although doses up to 30 mg have been evaluated in short duration studies, doses higher than the 9 mg dose currently being tested in our Phase 2 clinical trials may increase the risk or incidence of known potential side effects of SARMs including elevations in hepatic enzymes and further reductions in HDL, in addition to the emergence of side effects that have not been seen to date. Although no evidence of virilization has been seen to date with any dose of enobosarm, higher doses for longer duration may increase the risk of hair growth and masculinization in some women.\nIf the incidence of serious or other adverse events related to our product candidates increases in number or severity, if a regulatory authority believes that these or other events constitute an adverse effect caused by the drug, or if other effects are identified during clinical trials that we or any potential collaborators may conduct in the future or after any of our product candidates are approved and marketed:\n\u2022 we or any potential collaborators may be required to conduct additional preclinical or clinical trials, make changes in the labeling of any such approved products, reformulate any such products, or implement changes to or obtain new approvals of our contractors' manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may be unwilling to approve our product candidates or may withdraw approval of our products;\n\u2022 we may experience a significant drop in the sales of the affected products;\n\u2022 our reputation in the marketplace may suffer; and\n\u2022 we may become the target of lawsuits, including class action suits.\nAny of these events could prevent approval or harm sales of the affected product candidates or products, or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing any such products.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nIf we do not establish collaborations for our product candidates or otherwise raise substantial additional capital, we will likely need to alter, delay or abandon our development and any commercialization plans.\nOur strategy includes selectively partnering or collaborating with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to assist us in furthering development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators, and collaborations are complex and time consuming to negotiate and document. We may not be successful in entering into new collaborations with third parties on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, we are unable to predict when, if ever, we will enter into any additional collaborative arrangements because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing such arrangements. If we are unable to negotiate new collaborations, we may have to curtail the development of a particular product candidate, reduce, delay, or terminate its development or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. For example, we may have to cease further development of our enobosarm 3 mg and GTx-758 programs if we are unable to raise sufficient funding for any additional clinical development of these product candidates through new collaborative arrangements with third parties or other financing alternatives. In this regard, if we decide to undertake any further development of GTx-758 and/or enobosarm beyond our ongoing and currently-planned clinical trials, we would need to obtain additional funding for such development, either through financing or by entering into collaborative arrangements or partnerships with third parties for any such further development. Moreover, both of the planned Phase 2 clinical trials of enobosarm are designed to be conducted using a Simon's two-stage design, pursuant to which we plan to enroll approximately half of the patients in the first stage, and, upon achievement of a pre-specified minimal response rate, we plan to proceed with enrollment of the second stage. However, even if we achieve the pre-specified minimal response rate, our ability to proceed with enrollment of and to complete the second stage in both trials is subject to our ability to obtain additional funding, which we may be unable to do. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining additional funding in any event. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to advance the development of our product candidates or otherwise bring our product candidates to market and generate product revenues.\nAny collaborative arrangements that we establish in the future may not be successful or we may otherwise not realize the anticipated benefits from these collaborations. In addition, any future collaborative arrangements may place the development and commercialization of our product candidates outside our control, may require us to relinquish important rights or may otherwise be on terms unfavorable to us.\nWe have in the past established and intend to continue to establish collaborations with third parties to develop and commercialize some of our current and future product candidates, and these collaborations may not be successful or we may otherwise not realize the anticipated benefits from these collaborations. For example, in March 2011, we and Ipsen Biopharm Limited, or Ipsen, mutually agreed to terminate our collaboration for the development and commercialization of our toremifene-based product candidate, and, as a result, we will not receive any additional milestone payments from Ipsen on account of our collaboration with Ipsen. As of the date of this report, we have no ongoing collaborations for the development and commercialization of our product candidates. We may not be able to locate third-party collaborators to develop and market our product candidates, and we lack the capital and resources necessary to develop our product candidates alone.\nDependence on collaborative arrangements subjects us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022 we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our potential collaborators may devote to our product candidates;\n\u2022 potential collaborations may experience financial difficulties or changes in business focus;\n\u2022 we may be required to relinquish important rights such as marketing and distribution rights;\n\u2022 should a collaborator fail to develop or commercialize one of our compounds or product candidates, we may not receive any future milestone payments and will not receive any royalties for the compound or product candidate;\n\u2022 business combinations or significant changes in a collaborator's business strategy may also adversely affect a collaborator's willingness or ability to complete its obligations under any arrangement;\n\u2022 under certain circumstances, a collaborator could move forward with a competing product candidate developed either independently or in collaboration with others, including our competitors; and\n\u2022 collaborative arrangements are often terminated or allowed to expire, which could delay the development and may increase the cost of developing our product candidates.\nIf third parties do not manufacture our product candidates in sufficient quantities, in the required timeframe, at an acceptable cost, and with appropriate quality control, clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates would be delayed.\nWe do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities, and we rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins, if any, and our ability to develop product candidates and commercialize any product candidates on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe rely on third-party vendors for the manufacture of enobosarm drug substance. If the contract manufacturers that we are currently utilizing to meet our supply needs for enobosarm or any future SARM product candidates prove incapable or unwilling to continue to meet our supply needs, we could experience a delay in conducting any additional clinical trials of enobosarm or any future SARM product candidates. In addition, we rely on third-party contractors for the manufacture of GTx-758 drug substance. We may not be able to maintain or renew our existing or any other third-party manufacturing arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all. If our suppliers fail to meet our requirements for GTx-758, enobosarm or any future product candidates for any reason, we would be required to obtain alternate suppliers. Any inability to obtain alternate suppliers, including an inability to obtain approval from the FDA of an alternate supplier, would delay or prevent the clinical development and commercialization of these product candidates.\nUse of third-party manufacturers may increase the risk that we will not have adequate supplies of our product candidates or products.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks, to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates or products ourselves, including:\n\u2022 reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022 the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control;\n\u2022 the possible termination or non-renewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us; and\n\u2022 drug product supplies not meeting the requisite requirements for clinical trial use.\nIf we are not able to obtain adequate supplies of our product candidates, it will be more difficult for us to develop our product candidates and compete effectively. Our product candidates and any products that we and/or our potential collaborators may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities.\nOur present or future manufacturing partners may not be able to comply with FDA-mandated current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations, other FDA regulatory requirements or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Failure of our third-party manufacturers or us to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our product candidates.\nIf third parties on whom we rely do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials for our product candidates, and we must rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, or CROs, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct our clinical trials. In addition, we rely on third parties to assist with our preclinical development of product candidates. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we lose our license from the University of Tennessee Research Foundation, or UTRF, we may be unable to continue a substantial part of our business.\nWe have licensed intellectual property rights and technology from UTRF used in a substantial part of our business. This license agreement, under which we were granted rights to SARM compounds and technologies, including enobosarm, may be terminated by UTRF if we are in breach of our obligations under, or fail to perform any terms of, the agreement and fail to cure that breach. If this agreement is terminated, then we may lose our rights to utilize the SARM technology and intellectual property covered by that agreement to market, distribute and sell licensed products, including enobosarm, which may prevent us from continuing a substantial part of our business and may result in a material and serious adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and any prospects for growth.\nIf some or all of our or our licensors' patents expire or are invalidated or are found to be unenforceable, or if some or all of our patent applications do not result in issued patents or result in patents with narrow, overbroad, or unenforceable claims, or claims that are not supported in regard to written description or enablement by the specification, or if we are prevented from asserting that the claims of an issued patent cover a product of a third party, we may be subject to competition from third parties with products in the same class of products as our product candidates or products with the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as our product candidates, including in those jurisdictions in which we have no patent protection.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection for our product candidates, as well as the methods for treating patients in the product indications using these product candidates. We will be able to protect our product candidates and the methods for treating patients in the product indications using these product candidates from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that we or our exclusive licensors own or control such valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets.\nOur rights to certain patents and patent applications relating to SARM compounds that we have licensed from UTRF are subject to the terms of UTRF's inter-institutional agreements with The Ohio State University, or OSU, and our rights to future related improvements in some instances are subject to UTRF's exercise of exclusive options under its agreements with OSU for such improvements.\nEven if our product candidates and the methods for treating patients for prescribed indications using these product candidates are covered by valid and enforceable patents and have claims with sufficient scope, disclosure and support in the specification, the patents will provide protection only for a limited amount of time. Our and our licensors' ability to obtain patents can be highly uncertain and involve complex and in some cases unsettled legal issues and factual questions. Furthermore, different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents, and patents issued in different countries provide different degrees of protection against the use of a patented invention by others. Therefore, if the issuance to us or our licensors, in a given country, of a patent covering an invention is not followed by the issuance, in other countries, of patents covering the same invention, or if any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability, or scope of the claims in, or the written description or enablement in, a patent issued in one country is not similar to the interpretation given to the corresponding patent issued in another country, our ability to protect our intellectual property in those countries may be limited. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nWe may be subject to competition from third parties with products in the same class of products as our product candidates or products with the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as our product candidates in those jurisdictions in which we have no patent protection. Even if patents are issued to us\nor our licensors regarding our product candidates or methods of using them, those patents can be challenged by our competitors who can argue such patents are invalid or unenforceable, lack of utility, lack sufficient written description or enablement, or that the claims of the issued patents should be limited or narrowly construed. Patents also will not protect our product candidates if competitors devise ways of making or using these product candidates without legally infringing our patents. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA regulations and policies create a regulatory environment that encourages companies to challenge branded drug patents or to create non-infringing versions of a patented product in order to facilitate the approval of abbreviated new drug applications for generic substitutes. These same types of incentives encourage competitors to submit new drug applications that rely on literature and clinical data not prepared for or by the drug sponsor, providing another less burdensome pathway to approval.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors, and confidentiality agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nIf we infringe intellectual property rights of third parties, it may increase our costs or prevent us from being able to commercialize our product candidates.\nThere is a risk that we are infringing the proprietary rights of third parties because numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields that are the focus of our development and manufacturing efforts. Others might have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our or our licensors' pending patent applications and issued patents and/or might have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions. In addition, because patent applications take many months to publish and patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us or our licensors, which may later result in issued patents that cover the production, manufacture, synthesis, commercialization, formulation or use of our product candidates. In addition, the production, manufacture, synthesis, commercialization, formulation or use of our product candidates may infringe existing patents of which we are not aware. Defending ourselves against third-party claims, including litigation in particular, would be costly and time consuming and would divert management's attention from our business, which could lead to delays in our development or commercialization efforts. If third parties are successful in their claims, we might have to pay substantial damages or take other actions that are adverse to our business.\nAs a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we might:\n\u2022 be prohibited from selling or licensing any product that we and/or any potential collaborators may develop unless the patent holder licenses the patent to us, which the patent holder is not required to do;\n\u2022 be required to pay substantial royalties or other amounts, or grant a cross license to our patents to another patent holder; or\n\u2022 be required to redesign the formulation of a product candidate so that it does not infringe, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates\nIf we or any potential collaborators are not able to obtain required regulatory approvals, we or such collaborators will not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nOur product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA, other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries, including the EMA. Failure to obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate will prevent us or any potential collaborator from commercializing the product candidate. We have not received regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates in any jurisdiction, and we do not expect to obtain FDA, EMA or any other regulatory approvals to market any of our product candidates for the foreseeable future, if at all. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive, often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved.\nChanges in the regulatory approval policy during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional regulations or statutes, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Even if the FDA or the EMA approves a product candidate, the approval may impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses, conditions for use, labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and/or production of such product, and may impose ongoing requirements for post-approval studies, including additional research and development and clinical trials. Any FDA approval may also impose risk evaluation mitigation strategies, or REMS, on a product if the FDA believes there is a reason to monitor the safety of the drug in the market place. REMS may include requirements for additional training for health care professionals, safety communication efforts and limits on channels of distribution, among other things. The sponsor would be required to evaluate and monitor the various REMS activities and adjust them if need be. The FDA and EMA also may impose various civil or criminal sanctions for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, including withdrawal of product approval.\nFurthermore, the approval procedure and the time required to obtain approval varies among countries and can involve additional testing beyond that required by the FDA. Approval by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions.\nThe FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. For example, in October 2009, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA regarding our NDA for toremifene 80 mg to reduce fractures in men with prostate cancer on ADT notifying us that the FDA would not approve our NDA as a result of certain clinical deficiencies identified in the Complete Response Letter. We have since discontinued our toremifene 80 mg development program, as well as our other toremifene-based products and terminated our license and supply agreement with Orion for toremifene products. Although we evaluated the potential submission of a MAA to the EMA seeking marketing approval of enobosarm 3 mg in the EU for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with advanced NSCLC, based on recent input from the MHRA, we believe that the data from the POWER trials is not sufficient to support the filing and approval of a MAA without confirmatory data from another Phase 3 clinical trial of enobosarm 3 mg. As a result of this input, we do not intend to submit a MAA in the absence of such confirmatory data. In addition, since data from the two POWER trials failed to meet the primary statistical criterion pre-specified for the co-primary endpoints of lean body mass and physical function, the FDA will not accept a NDA for enobosarm 3 mg for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with advanced NSCLC. Accordingly, our strategy does not\ncurrently include further development of enobosarm for this indication in the U.S. or in Europe unless such development is part of a collaborative arrangement or strategic partnership.\nAdditionally, there can be no assurance that the FDA will determine that the data from our ongoing, planned or potential future clinical trials of enobosarm for the treatment of patients with AR positive advanced breast cancer or GTx-758 will be sufficient for approval of these product candidates in any indications. For example, we may observe an unacceptable incidence of adverse events in our ongoing, planned or potential clinical trials of enobosarm or GTx-758, which could require us to abandon the development of the affected product candidate.\nIn addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate. Even if we submit an application to the FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities for marketing approval of a product candidate, it may not result in any marketing approvals.\nWe do not expect to receive regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates that are in development for the foreseeable future, if at all. The inability to obtain approval from the FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities for our product candidates would prevent us or any potential collaborators from commercializing these product candidates in the United States, the EU, or other countries. See the section entitled \"Business - Government Regulation\" under Part 1, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding risks associated with marketing approval, as well as risks related to potential post-approval requirements.\nRisks Related to Commercialization\nThe commercial success of any products that we and/or any potential collaborators may develop will depend upon the market and the degree of market acceptance among physicians, patients, health care payors and the medical community.\nAny products that we and/or any potential collaborators may develop, including enobosarm, may not gain market acceptance for its stated indication among physicians, patients, health care payors and the medical community. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate material product revenues or receive royalties to the extent we currently anticipate, and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 efficacy and safety results in clinical trials;\n\u2022 the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022 potential advantages over alternative treatments;\n\u2022 whether the products we commercialize remain a preferred course of treatment;\n\u2022 the ability to offer our product candidates for sale at competitive prices;\n\u2022 relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022 the strength of marketing and distribution support; and\n\u2022 sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement.\nFor example, if we are able to raise sufficient funding for any additional clinical development of enobosarm 3 mg through new collaborative arrangements with third parties or other financing alternatives and a MAA is submitted to the EMA for the marketing approval of enobosarm 3 mg in the EU for the more narrow indication of the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with platinum plus taxane chemotherapy and marketing approval is obtained, we anticipate that the commercial prospects for enobosarm 3 mg could be diminished as a result of this more limited product indication.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or establish and maintain agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate product revenue from such candidates.\nWe have limited experience as a company in the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. In the event one of our product candidates is approved, we will need to establish sales and marketing capabilities or establish and maintain agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates. We may be unable to build our own sales and marketing capabilities, and there are risks involved with entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services, which could delay the commercialization of any of our product candidates if approved for commercial sale. In addition, to the extent that we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, our product revenues are likely to be lower than if we market and sell any products that we develop ourselves.\nIf we and/or any potential collaborators are unable to obtain reimbursement or experience a reduction in reimbursement from third-party payors for products we sell, our revenues and prospects for profitability will suffer.\nSales of products developed by us and/or any potential collaborators are dependent on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payors. Changes in the reimbursement policies of these third-party payors that reduce reimbursements for any products that we and/or any potential collaborators may develop and sell could negatively impact our future operating and financial results.\nMedicare coverage and reimbursement of prescription drugs exists under Medicare Part D for oral drug products capable of self-administration by patients. Our oral drug product candidates would likely be covered by Medicare Part D (if covered by Medicare at all). In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. This health care reform legislation will increase the number of individuals who receive health insurance coverage and will close a gap in drug coverage under Medicare Part D. The legislation, however, also implemented cost containment and other measures that could adversely affect revenues from sales of product candidates, including an increase in drug rebates manufacturers must pay under Medicaid for brand name prescription drugs and extension of these rebates to Medicaid managed care.\nPharmaceutical manufacturers and importers of brand name prescription drugs are assessed a fee based on our proportionate share of sales of brand name prescription drugs to certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, made in the preceding year if such sales exceed a defined threshold. Since 2011, manufacturers have been required to provide a 50% discount on brand name prescription drugs sold to beneficiaries who fall within a gap that exists in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (commonly known as the \"donut hole\").\nThe health care reform legislation has been subject to political and judicial challenge. In 2012, the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of certain provisions of the law. The court upheld as constitutional the mandate for individuals to obtain health insurance but held that the provision\nallowing the federal government to withhold certain Medicaid funds to states that do not expand state Medicaid programs was unconstitutional. The impact of the court's ruling remains uncertain. Political and judicial challenges to the law may continue in the wake of the court's ruling.\nEconomic pressure on state budgets may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for drugs. State Medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization for use of drugs where supplemental rebates are not provided. Private health insurers and managed care plans are likely to continue challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many of these third-party payors may limit reimbursement for newly-approved health care products. In particular, third-party payors may limit the indications for which they will reimburse patients who use any products that we and/or any potential collaborators may develop or sell. These cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we or any potential collaborators may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us.\nSimilar cost containment initiatives exist in countries outside of the United States, particularly in the countries of the EU, where the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us or any potential collaborators to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our or a potential collaborators' commercialization efforts. Third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly-approved health care products. Recently budgetary pressures in many EU countries are also causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost containment measures. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we or any potential collaborators may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us.\nAnother development that could affect the pricing of drugs would be if the Secretary of Health and Human Services allowed drug reimportation into the United States. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 gives discretion to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to allow drug reimportation into the United States under some circumstances from foreign countries, including from countries where the drugs are sold at a lower price than in the United States. If the circumstances were met and the Secretary exercised the discretion to allow for the direct reimportation of drugs, it could decrease the price we or any potential collaborators receive for any products that we and/or any potential collaborators may develop, negatively affecting our revenues and prospects for profitability.\nHealth care reform measures could hinder or prevent our product candidates' commercial success.\nAmong policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting health care reform, as evidenced by the enactment in the United States of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act in 2010. Federal and state legislatures within the United States and foreign governments will likely continue to consider changes to existing health care legislation. These changes adopted by governments may adversely impact our business by lowering the price of health care products in the United States and elsewhere.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to health care availability, method of delivery or payment for health care products and services, or sales, marketing and pricing practices could negatively impact our business, operations and financial condition.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to our prior commercial sales of FARESTON\u00ae and the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials, and we will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any product that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022 decreased demand for any product candidates or products;\n\u2022 injury to our reputation;\n\u2022 withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022 costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022 substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022 loss of revenue; and\n\u2022 the inability to commercialize any products for which we obtain or hold marketing approvals.\nWe have product liability insurance that covers our clinical trials and any commercial products up to a $25 million annual aggregate limit. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, and we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nIf our competitors are better able to develop and market products than any products that we and/or any potential collaborators may develop, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.\nWe face competition from commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than any products that we and/or any potential collaborators may develop. Competition could result in reduced sales and pricing pressure on our product candidates, if approved, which in turn would reduce our ability to generate meaningful revenue and have a negative impact on our results of operations. In addition, significant delays in the development of our product candidates could allow our competitors to bring products to market before us and impair any ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nVarious products are currently marketed or used off-label for some of the diseases and conditions that we are targeting in our pipeline, and a number of companies are or may be developing new treatments. These product uses, as well as promotional efforts by competitors and/or clinical trial results of competitive products, could significantly diminish any ability to market and sell any products that we and/or any potential collaborators may develop.\nWith respect to our SARM program, there are other SARM product candidates in development that may compete with enobosarm and any future SARM product candidates, if approved for commercial sale. We plan to advance the development of enobosarm for the treatment of patients with AR positive advanced breast cancer. To our knowledge, no other SARMs are currently in development for this indication; although SARMs in development for muscle wasting and cachexia could enter into a breast cancer program in the future. For example, Radius Health, Inc. has stated that it may test its\nSARM compound, RAD140, in a breast cancer indication in the future. A number of other compounds targeting the androgen axis in breast cancer could compete with enobosarm if one or more are approved for commercial sale in the indications for which enobosarm is being developed. These compounds fall into two categories, androgen synthesis inhibitors, or ASIs, and androgen receptor antagonists, or ARAs. ASIs in development include orteronel being developed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals and Zytiga\u00ae being developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals. ARAs in development include XTANDI\u00ae (enzalutamide) being developed by Medivation and Astellas Pharma, and generic bicalutamide. Agents targeting pathways outside of the androgen axis also may compete with enobosarm in breast cancer as they are directed towards similar patient populations that may benefit from enobosarm. Additionally, we plan to initiate a proof of concept study in advanced AR positive TNBC patients for which there are no currently approved therapies, beyond chemotherapy. However, a number of approaches for the treatment of TNBC are currently under investigation. Agents also targeting the androgen axis include XTANDI\u00ae (enzalutamide) being developed by Medivation and Astellas Pharma, orteronel (TAK-700) being developed by Takeda, and CR-1447 being developed by Curadis. Only a subset of the total TNBC population is AR positive; therefore, agents targeting TNBC as a whole may also compete with enobosarm if approved for commercial sale. These agents include: PI3K/AKT inhibitors (BKM120 being developed by Novartis), IL6/JAK/Stat inhibitors (ruxolitinib being developed by Incyte), mTOR inhibitors (Neratinib being developed by Puma), and PARP inhibitors (Velaparib being developed by AbbVie), PD-1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab) being developed by Merck & Co. and MPDL3280A being developed by Roche.\nWe are developing GTx-758 for secondary hormonal therapy in men with CRPC, and, potentially, as a secondary hormonal treatment for advanced prostate cancer used in combination with androgen deprivation therapy. There are various products approved or under clinical development to treat men with advanced prostate cancer who have metastatic CRPC which may compete with GTx-758. Provenge\u00ae, which was recently acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals, is an autologous cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer. Medivation and Astellas Pharma market XTANDI\u00ae (enzalutamide), an oral androgen receptor antagonist, for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in men previously treated with docetaxel as well as those that have not yet received chemotherapy. Zytiga\u00ae, sold by Johnson & Johnson, has been approved for the treatment of metastatic CRPC in patients who have received prior chemotherapy and recently received approval for the treatment of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer prior to chemotherapy. Johnson & Johnson acquired Aragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which developed a second generation anti-androgen (ARN-509) that is currently being evaluated in Phase 2 studies in men with progressive, advanced prostate cancer. Bayer HealthCare and Orion Corporation are currently performing a Phase 3 study of ODM-201 in men with CRPC without metastases and with a rising PSA examining safety and efficacy by measuring metastatic free survival. Millennium: The Takeda Oncology Company is developing TAK-700 for the treatment of men with metastatic CRPC prior to chemotherapy.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business.\nRisks Related to Employees, Growth and Other Aspects of Operations\nManagement transition creates uncertainties and could harm our business.\nWe have recently had significant changes in executive leadership, and more could occur. Effective December 31, 2013, Mark Mosteller resigned as our Chief Financial Officer. In connection with Mr. Mosteller's resignation, Marc S. Hanover, who was then serving as our President and Chief Operating Officer, was appointed as our acting principal financial officer and Jason T. Shackelford, who was then serving as our Corporate Controller and Director of Accounting, was appointed as our principal accounting officer. On April 3, 2014, Mitchell S. Steiner resigned as our Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. On April 3, 2014, Mr. Hanover was appointed as our interim Chief Executive Officer and on February 12, 2015, Mr. Hanover was appointed as our permanent Chief Executive Officer. Upon the appointment of Mr. Hanover as interim Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Hanover ceased to perform the duties of our principal financial officer, which duties were assigned to Mr. Shackelford. Additionally, James T. Dalton, our former Chief Scientific Officer, resigned effective August 31, 2014. Finally, on March 2, 2015, Robert J. Wills was appointed as our Executive Chairman.\nAs a result of the recent changes in our management team, Messrs. Hanover and Shackelford have taken on substantially more responsibility for the management of our business and of our financial reporting which has resulted in greater workload demands and could divert their attention away from certain key areas of our business. For instance, Mr. Hanover has taken on the role of our Chief Executive Officer in addition to the role he served when functioning as our President and Chief Operating Officer, positions that were previously occupied by two persons. In addition, while Dr. Wills' role as our Executive Chairman is, in part, to support Mr. Hanover in his role as our permanent Chief Executive Officer, the position of Executive Chairman is new to us and it may be some time before we can assess how much assistance he will provide to Mr. Hanover. Also, while we have retained Dr. Dalton as a consultant to GTx following his employment end date, we no longer have regular access to Dr. Dalton's key scientific expertise, which could materially and adversely impact our product candidate development efforts. Disruption to our organization as a result of executive management transition may have a detrimental impact on our ability to implement our strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to company strategy, which can often times occur with the appointment of new executives, can create uncertainty, may negatively impact our ability to execute quickly and effectively, and may ultimately be unsuccessful. In addition, executive leadership transition periods are often difficult as the new executives gain detailed knowledge of our operations, and friction can result from changes in strategy and management style. Management transition inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge, which can negatively affect strategy and execution. Until we integrate new personnel, and unless they are able to succeed in their positions, we may be unable to successfully manage and grow our business, and our results of operations and financial condition could suffer as a result.\nOur internal computer and information technology systems, or those of our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, or could otherwise face serious disruptions, which could result in a material disruption of our product development efforts.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such events could cause interruptions of our operations. For instance, the loss of preclinical data or data from our ongoing, planned and potential future clinical trials involving our product candidates could result in delays in our development and regulatory filing efforts and significantly increase our costs. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the\ndevelopment of our product candidates could be delayed. In addition, our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems, including corporate firewalls, servers, leased lines and connection to the Internet, face the risk of systemic failure that could disrupt our operations. A significant disruption in the availability of our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems could cause delays in our research and development work and could otherwise adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to attract and keep senior management and key scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates.\nOur success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical and scientific personnel and on our ability to develop and maintain important relationships with leading academic institutions, clinicians and scientists. If we are not able to attract and keep senior management and key scientific personnel, we may not be able to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates. All of our employees are at-will employees and can terminate their employment at any time.\nIn October 2013, we announced a reduction of approximately 60% of our workforce following our announcement that our POWER trials failed to achieve the results required by the FDA to file a NDA for enobosarm 3 mg for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with advanced NSCLC. In addition, since our October 2013 workforce reduction, our former Chief Executive Officer, former Chief Financial Officer and former Chief Scientific Officer have resigned. Primarily as a result of our October 2013 workforce reduction, only 25 employees remained as employees of GTx as of December 31, 2014. Accordingly, we have been and are operating with a shortage of resources and may not be able to effectively conduct our operations with this limited number of employees. In addition, we announced past workforce reductions in each of December 2009 and June 2011, and our history of implementing workforce reductions, along with the potential for future workforce reductions, may negatively affect our ability to retain or attract talented employees. Further, to the extent we experience additional management transition, competition for top management is high and it may take many months to find a candidate that meets our requirements. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified management personnel, our business could suffer.\nWe will need to hire additional employees in order to grow our business. Any inability to manage future growth could harm our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates, increase our costs and adversely impact our ability to compete effectively.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had only 25 employees, and we will need to hire experienced personnel to develop and commercialize our product candidates and to otherwise grow our business, and we will need to expand the number of our managerial, operational, financial and other employees to support that growth. Competition exists for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field.\nFuture growth, if any, will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate additional employees. Our future financial performance and our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nIf we fail to meet continued listing standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, our common stock may be delisted. Delisting could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease, and our ability to obtain sufficient additional capital to fund our operations and to continue as a going concern would be substantially impaired.\nOur common stock is currently listed on The NASDAQ Global Market. The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, or NASDAQ, has minimum requirements that a company must meet in order to remain listed on The NASDAQ Global Market. These requirements include maintaining a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share. On October 2, 2014, we received a letter from NASDAQ notifying us that for the previous 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price for our common stock was below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on The NASDAQ Global Market, or the Bid Price Requirement. In accordance with NASDAQ listing rules, we were afforded 180 calendar days, or until March 31, 2015, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement. In anticipation of not meeting the Bid Price Requirement by March 31, 2015, we applied to transfer the listing of our common stock to The NASDAQ Capital Market on March 13, 2015. If our transfer application is approved and we are able meet certain initial listing criteria for listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market on April 1, 2015, we expect to be afforded an additional 180 calendar day compliance period to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement (as applied to listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market); however, we cannot assure you that we will in fact be afforded an additional 180 calendar day compliance period, in part since NASDAQ retains discretion to not afford us an additional compliance period irrespective of our meeting these initial listing criteria, in which case, our common stock will be subject to delisting. If our transfer application is approved and we are afforded an additional 180 calendar day compliance period on April 1, 2015, we would have until September 28, 2015 in order to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement. In this regard, we have provided written notice to NASDAQ of our intention to cure the Bid Price Requirement deficiency during this second 180 calendar day compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If our transfer application is approved and we are afforded an additional 180 day compliance period but we do not regain compliance by September 28, 2015, then NASDAQ will provide written notice that our common stock will be subject to delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market. To regain compliance, our common stock must close at or above the $1.00 minimum bid price for at least 10 consecutive days or more at the discretion of NASDAQ. If we are not afforded an additional 180 day compliance period our common stock would be subject to immediate delisting. In either of those events, we may appeal the decision to a NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel, but there can be no assurance that any such appeal would be successful. In addition, we may be unable to meet other applicable NASDAQ listing requirements, including maintaining minimum levels of stockholders' equity or market values of our common stock in which case, our common stock could be delisted notwithstanding our ability to demonstrate compliance with the Bid Price Requirement.\nIf our common stock is delisted, we would expect our common stock to be traded in the over-the-counter market, which could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock. Additionally, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022 a limited availability of market quotations for our common stock;\n\u2022 a reduced amount of news and analyst coverage for us;\n\u2022 a decreased ability to issue additional securities and a concomitant substantial impairment in our ability to obtain sufficient additional capital to fund our operations and to continue as a going concern;\n\u2022 reduced liquidity for our stockholders;\n\u2022 potential loss of confidence by employees and potential future partners or collaborators; and\n\u2022 loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. This volatility may cause our stock price and the value of your investment to decline.\nThe market prices for securities of biotechnology companies, including ours, have been highly volatile and may continue to be so in the future. In this regard, the market price for our common stock has varied between a high of $2.35 on January 17, 2014 and a low of $0.41 on October 14, 2014 in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2014. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022 delays in the initiation, enrollment and/or completion of our ongoing, planned and any future clinical trials of enobosarm and GTx-758, or negative, inconclusive or mixed results reported in any of our ongoing, planned and any future clinical trials of enobosarm and GTx-758;\n\u2022 our ability to raise additional capital in the future to carry through with our clinical development plans, including to commence and complete stage two of both of our planned Phase 2 clinical trials of enobosarm, as well as our current and future operations, and the terms of any related financing arrangements;\n\u2022 reports of unacceptable incidences of adverse events observed in any of our ongoing and planned clinical trials of enobosarm and GTx-758;\n\u2022 announcements regarding further cost-cutting initiatives or restructurings;\n\u2022 uncertainties created by our past and potential future management turnover;\n\u2022 our ability to enter into new collaborative, licensing or other strategic arrangements with respect to our product candidates;\n\u2022 the terms and timing of any future collaborative, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u2022 the timing of achievement of, or failure to achieve, our and any potential collaborators' clinical, regulatory and other milestones, such as the commencement of clinical development, the completion of a clinical trial or the receipt of regulatory approval;\n\u2022 announcement of FDA approval or non-approval of our product candidates or delays in or adverse events during the FDA review process;\n\u2022 actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our product candidates or our clinical trials, including regulatory actions requiring or leading to a delay or stoppage of our ongoing or planned clinical trials;\n\u2022 the commercial success of any product approved by the FDA or its foreign counterparts;\n\u2022 introductions or announcements of technological innovations or new products by us, our potential collaborators, or our competitors, and the timing of these introductions or announcements;\n\u2022 market conditions for equity investments in general, or the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries in particular;\n\u2022 announcements regarding our ability to comply with the minimum listing requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC;\n\u2022 regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022 changes in the structure or reimbursement policies of health care payment systems;\n\u2022 any intellectual property infringement lawsuit involving us;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022 changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022 hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop regarding our common stock;\n\u2022 sales of large blocks of our common stock;\n\u2022 sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022 the trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022 changes in accounting principles; and\n\u2022 additional losses of any of our key scientific or management personnel.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced significant volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the past, class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price. Any such litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs, which would hurt our financial condition and results of operations and divert management's attention and resources, which could result in delays of our clinical trials or commercialization efforts.\nOur executive officers, directors and largest stockholders have the ability to control all matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our executive officers, directors and holders of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock, including their affiliated or associated entities, held approximately 75.7% of our outstanding common stock, and our executive officers and directors alone, including their affiliated or associated entities, held approximately 35.8% of our outstanding common stock as well as warrants to purchase up to an additional 29.9 million shares of common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, have the ability to control all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change,\" generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change taxable income or taxes may be limited. Although we have recently completed a study to determine whether any Section 382 limitations exist and we do not believe that any Section 382 limitations exist at this time, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code is an extremely complex provision with respect to which there are many uncertainties and we have not established whether the IRS agrees with our determination. In any event, changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could in the future result in an ownership change and an accompanying Section 382 limitation. If a limitation were to apply, utilization of a portion of our domestic net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could be limited in future periods and a portion of the carryforwards could expire before being available to reduce future income tax liabilities.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors. Because our Board of Directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. These provisions include:\n\u2022 a classified Board of Directors;\n\u2022 a prohibition on actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022 the ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \"poison pill\" that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors; and\n\u2022 limitations on the removal of directors.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Finally, these provisions establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings. These provisions would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.\nIf there are substantial sales of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could drop substantially, even if our business is doing well.\nFor the 12-month period ended December 31, 2014, the average daily trading volume of our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Market was 432,274 shares. As a result, future sales of a\nsubstantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the then-prevailing market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2014, we had 140,325,643 shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, as a result of the relatively low trading volume of our common stock, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the market price of our common stock in either direction. The price for our shares could, for example, decline significantly in the event that a large number of our common shares are sold on the market without commensurate demand, as compared to an issuer with a higher trading volume that could better absorb those sales without an adverse impact on its stock price.\nIn November 2014, we completed a private placement 64.3 million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 64.3 million shares of our common stock. Similarly, in March 2014 we completed a private placement of 12.0 million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 10.2 million shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of a registration rights agreement we entered into in connection with the March 2014 private placement, we filed a registration statement under the Securities Act registering the resale of the 12.0 million shares of common stock we issued to the investors in the March 2014 private placement, which include J.R. Hyde, III, our largest stockholder, as well as the 10.2 million shares of common stock underlying the warrants we issued to those investors. Likewise, pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement we entered into in connection with the November 2014 private placement, we filed a registration statement under the Securities Act registering the resale of the 64.3 million shares of common stock we issued to the investors in the November 2014 private placement, which included J.R. Hyde, III, and we also agreed to file one or more registration statements covering the resale of the 64.3 million shares of common stock subject to the warrants we issued to the investors in the November 2014 private placement. Moreover, J.R. Hyde, III and certain of his affiliates, have rights under a separate registration rights agreement with us to require us to file resale registration statements covering an additional 7.9 million shares of common stock held in the aggregate or to include these shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. If Mr. Hyde or his affiliates or any of our other significant stockholders, including the other investors in our 2014 private placements, were to sell large blocks of shares in a short period of time, the market price of our common stock could drop substantially.", "PERMNO": 90031, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ONCT"}
