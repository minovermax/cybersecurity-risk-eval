{"cik": "1422105", "company": "Noranda Aluminum Holding CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect us. If any of the events addressed in these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and you should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nCyclical fluctuations in the primary aluminum industry cause variability in our earnings and cash flows.\nThe Midwest Transaction Price for primary aluminum is a significant driver of our revenues, earnings, and cash flows. That price, comprising the underlying base metal component, which is typically based on quoted prices from global exchanges such as the LME, and the Midwest Premium, which represents the incremental price over the base LME component and is associated with the physical delivery of metal to a particular region has historically been volatile, as illustrated in the chart below:\nThe Midwest Transaction Price components are each subject to regional and global market supply and demand and other related factors. Such factors include production activities by competitors, production costs in major production regions, economic conditions, interest rates, non-market political pressures, speculative activities by market participants and currency exchange rates. Specifically, the proposed LME warehousing rules require metal warehouses, under certain conditions, to deliver out more aluminum than they take in. Increasing the aluminum supply in the market may decrease the LME aluminum price and Midwest premium. Extended periods of industry overcapacity may result in a weak pricing environment and margin compression for aluminum producers, including Noranda.\nOur significant cost components, specifically our supply of alumina, which we provide internally, and our New Madrid power contracts are not tied to the LME aluminum price. As a result, as the LME aluminum price decreases, absent corresponding decreases in our raw material costs or productivity gains, our profit margins may suffer, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we have, at times, hedged our exposure to the volatility of LME aluminum prices, we currently have no such hedges in place. We are under no obligation under our debt agreements or otherwise to enter into further hedging arrangements. If we do not undertake further hedging activities, we will continue to have price risk with respect to our primary aluminum shipments. A prolonged downturn in prices for primary aluminum products could significantly reduce the amount of cash available to us to meet our current obligations and fund our long-term business strategies. In addition, we may enter into new hedging arrangements in the future, which may not be beneficial, depending on subsequent LME aluminum price changes, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For additional information regarding our hedging activities, see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\u201d\nAluminum prices could decrease due to proposed London Metal Exchange warehousing rules\nIn 2013, the London Metal Exchange (\u201cLME\u201d) announced new rules scheduled to take effect on April 1, 2014 that would require LME warehouses, under certain conditions, to deliver out more aluminum than they take in. Although a court in the United Kingdom ruled in March 2014 that the LME\u2019s consultation process in developing the new rules had been unfair and unlawful, in October 2014, a court of appeal in the United Kingdom upheld the LME\u2019s consultation process as being fair. The new warehousing rules, which took effect on February 1, 2015, could cause an increase in the supply of aluminum to enter the physical market and may cause regional delivery premiums, product premiums and LME aluminum prices to fall. Decreases in regional delivery and product premiums, decreases in LME aluminum prices and increases in the supply of aluminum could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flow.\nA downturn in general economic conditions, as well as a downturn in the end-use markets for certain of our products, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nHistorically, demand for primary aluminum has been highly correlated to general economic and market conditions in the United States and other major global economies, including China. A sustained decline in either the United States or the global primary aluminum market would have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe substantial majority of our products are delivered to destinations in the United States. However, adverse changes in economic conditions in regions outside the United States, may have a negative impact on demand for our products. Such negative impacts may include, among others, lower LME aluminum prices, which are set globally, increased competition due to excess supply or demand for our customers\u2019 products. In addition, certain end-use markets for our rolled products, such as the housing, construction and transportation industries, experience demand cycles that typically are correlated to the general economic environment. Economic downturns in regional and global economies or a decrease in manufacturing activity in industries such as construction, packaging and consumer goods, all of which are sensitive to a number of factors outside our control, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may encounter increases in the cost of raw materials, which could cause our cost of goods sold to increase, thereby materially and adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and limiting our operating flexibility.\nIn the production of our products, we require substantial amounts of purchased raw materials, including carbon products and caustic soda. Pricing volatility of purchased raw materials can have a significant impact on our costs. If raw material prices increase, we may not be able to pass on the entire cost of the increases to our customers or offset fully the effects of the increases through productivity improvements, in which case our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf the cost of alumina produced by the Gramercy refinery or the cost of bauxite produced by the St. Ann mining operation exceeds the spot prices of alumina or bauxite available from other sources, we may not be able to immediately decrease production in response to changes in market forces. Therefore, our unit costs will increase and our ability to fully recover fixed costs will be limited. We may be forced to sell excess alumina or bauxite at market prices that could be substantially lower than our cost to produce them, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDuring 2014, we sold approximately 42% of the bauxite from St. Ann to Sherwin Alumina Company pursuant to a contract that runs through 2018. Margins from these sales effectively reduce the net cost of bauxite to Gramercy. In the event Sherwin Alumina Company is unable to honor that contract, or chooses not to extend the contract upon expiration, the net cost of our bauxite could increase, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPrices for the raw materials used by our Downstream Business, including primary aluminum, recycled aluminum and alloying elements, are subject to continuous volatility and may increase from time to time. Our sales are generally made on the basis of a \u201cmargin over metal price,\u201d but if raw material costs other than metal increase, we may not be able to pass on the entire cost of the increases to our customers or offset fully the effects of high raw materials costs through productivity improvements, in which case our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, a sustained material increase in raw materials prices may cause some of our customers to substitute other materials for our products.\nWe may be unable to continue to compete successfully in the highly competitive markets in which we operate.\nWe are engaged in a highly competitive industry. We compete with a number of large, well-established companies in each of the markets in which we operate. Our Primary Aluminum segment competes with a large number of other value-added metals producers on an international, national, regional and local basis. We also compete, to a much lesser extent, with primary metals producers, who typically sell to very large customers requiring regular shipments of large volumes of metals. Our Flat-Rolled Products segment competes in the production and sale of rolled aluminum products with a number of other aluminum rolling mills. Aluminum also competes with other materials, such as steel, copper, plastics, composite materials and glass, among others, for various applications. In the past, customers have demonstrated a willingness to substitute other materials for aluminum in certain applications. In both our Primary Aluminum and Flat-Rolled Products businesses, some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial and technical resources than we do. These larger competitors may be better able to withstand reductions in price or other adverse industry or economic conditions.\nSimilarly, competitors with superior cost positions to ours, particularly those competitors that operate smelters with access to relatively lower raw material, electric power or other production costs, may be better able to withstand reductions in price or other adverse industry or economic conditions. In the event that the current competitive smelter cost landscape changes such that other smelters see stability or reductions in their major production costs and/or we see increases in ours, the long-term viability of our smelter could be compromised. A current or new competitor may also add or build new capacity or increase import activity into the United States, which could diminish our profitability. New competitors could emerge from within North America or globally. If we do not compete successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, our Flat-Rolled Products segment competes with other rolled products suppliers, principally multi-purpose mills, on the basis of quality, price, timeliness of delivery, technological innovation and customer service. One primary competitive factor, particularly in the flat-rolled business, is price. We may be required in the future to reduce fabrication prices or shift our production to products that generally yield lower fabrication prices in order to remain at full productive capacity, which could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, technological innovation is important to our customers, and if we are unable to lead or effectively meet our competitors\u2019 new innovations to address our customers\u2019 needs, our financial performance could be materially and adversely impacted. Increased competition in any of our businesses could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAluminum may become less competitive with alternative materials, which could reduce our share of industry sales, lower our selling prices and reduce our sales volumes.\nAluminum competes with other materials such as steel, copper, plastics, composite materials and glass for various applications. Higher aluminum prices relative to substitute materials tend to make aluminum products less competitive with these alternative materials. The willingness of customers to accept aluminum substitutes, or the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect pricing for fabricated aluminum products, could result in a reduced share of industry sales or reduced prices for our products and services, which could decrease revenues or reduce volumes, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations consume substantial amounts of energy and our profitability may decline if energy costs rise.\nElectricity and natural gas are essential to our businesses, which are energy intensive. The costs of these resources can vary widely and unpredictably. The factors that affect our energy costs tend to be specific to each of our facilities.\nElectricity\nElectricity is the largest cost component at our New Madrid smelter and is a key factor to our long-term competitive position in the Primary Aluminum business. We have a long-term power supply agreement with Ameren, pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase substantially all the electricity required at New Madrid. The power supply contract provides that the rate for power will be established by the MoPSC based on two components: a base rate and a fuel adjustment charge. The MoPSC determines whether to make changes to the base rate and fuel adjustment charge.\nAmeren may increase the rates it charges its customers, including Noranda, subject to the approval of the MoPSC. Once a rate case is commenced by the filing of a rate increase request, the MoPSC has eleven months to issue its ruling on the request. Since 2008 Ameren has filed four rate cases with the MoPSC which has resulted in an approximately $44 million annual increase in the Company\u2019s cost of goods sold related to electricity, including FAC, at our New Madrid facility. The outcome of any future rate cases Ameren may initiate could materially and adversely affect the competitiveness and long-term viability of our smelter as well as our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nIn addition to base rate adjustments, our electric power costs are subject to a fuel adjustment clause, under which additional charges may be incurred, based on Ameren\u2019s fuel costs and off-system sales volume and prices. The fuel adjustment clause resulted in additional fuel charges recorded in cost of goods sold of $13.2 million, $17.9 million and $9.0 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The impact of the fuel adjustment clause may have a dramatic and unpredictable effect on our future operating results and cash flows.\nElectricity is also a key cost component at our rolling mill facilities. Electricity is purchased through medium term contracts at industrial rates from regional utilities supplied through local distributors. If we are unable to obtain power at affordable rates upon expiration of these contracts, we may be forced to curtail or idle a portion of our production capacity, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNatural gas\nNatural gas is the largest cost component at our Gramercy refinery and a key cost component at our rolling mill facilities. Our Gramercy refinery has a contract to guarantee secure supply at a price based on the Henry Hub Index natural gas price. Our Downstream Business purchases natural gas on the open market. The price of natural gas can be particularly volatile as supply and demand are affected by unpredictable weather and other factors. During early 2015, an improvement in weather, as compared to 2014, has driven the Henry Hub Index natural gas price to an average of under $3.00 per million BTU, compared to average natural gas prices of $4.35 per million BTU in 2014, $3.73 in 2013 and $2.75 in 2012. As a result, our natural gas costs may fluctuate dramatically, and we may not be able to mitigate the effect of higher natural gas costs on our cost of sales. Any substantial increases in natural gas costs could cause our operating\ncosts to increase and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have, from time to time, entered into forward swaps to mitigate the effect of fluctuations in natural gas prices. Since January 1, 2013, we have not been a party to any forward swaps for natural gas.\nFuel\nFuel is a substantial component of the cost structure at our St. Ann bauxite mining operation. Our fuel costs at St. Ann may fluctuate based on the price of oil and we may not be able to mitigate the effect of higher fuel costs. Any increases in fuel costs could cause our operating costs to increase and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLosses caused by disruptions in the supply of electrical power could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to losses associated with equipment shutdowns, which may be caused by the loss or interruption of electrical power to our facilities due to unusually high demand, blackouts, equipment failure, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. We use large amounts of electricity to produce primary aluminum. Any loss of power that causes an equipment shutdown can result in the hardening or \u201cfreezing\u201d of molten aluminum in the pots where it is produced. If this occurs, we may experience significant losses if the pots are damaged and require repair or replacement, a process that could limit or shut down our production operations for a prolonged period of time. We may ultimately experience shorter pot lives or higher failure rates as a result of damage from an equipment shutdown resulting from a smelter power outage, which most recently occurred in January 2009.\nAlthough we maintain property and business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from catastrophic events, we may be required to pay significant amounts under the deductible provisions of those insurance policies. In addition, our coverage may not be sufficient to cover all losses. Certain of our insurance policies do not cover any losses we may incur if our electric power suppliers are unable to provide us with power during periods of unusually high demand.\nIf we are unable to successfully finalize regulatory power issues at our New Madrid facility, we may have to curtail this facility.\nOn February 13, 2014, we filed a petition with the MoPSC to change the rate design for Ameren customers in Missouri in order to provide the New Madrid smelter with a lower, sustainable power rate. On July 3, 2014, Ameren filed a request with the MoPSC to approve a 9.6% increase in its Missouri rates (the \u201cJuly 2014 General Rate Case\u201d). On August 20, 2014, the MoPSC denied the relief sought under our rate design petition. In its ruling, the MoPSC encouraged the parties to continue to pursue negotiations on a compromise position that can be presented for consideration as part of the July 2014 General Rate Case, which is expected to be decided by May 2015. While we intend to vigorously pursue the matter, there can be no assurance that our efforts to secure a lower power rate for New Madrid will be successful.\nIn addition, uncertainty regarding the future operation of this smelter may damage our relationships with our customers, suppliers, employees and other stakeholders, whether or not this plant is ultimately curtailed. We may also need to take actions to terminate customer and supply contracts or curtail individual potlines well in advance of any plant closure. Customers and suppliers may also become unwilling to renew existing contracts or enter into new contracts with us. It may also become more difficult to attract and retain employees. Such actions and events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nCurtailing unprofitable production to reduce our operating costs requires us to incur substantial expense, both at the time of the curtailment and on an ongoing basis. Our facilities are subject to contractual and other fixed costs that continue even if we curtail operations at these facilities. These costs reduce the cost saving advantages of curtailing unprofitable aluminum production.\nIf any production curtailment or other restructuring does not achieve sufficient reduction in operating expenses, we may have to seek bankruptcy protection for some or all of our subsidiaries; we could also be forced to divest some or all of these subsidiaries. If we were to seek bankruptcy protection for any of these subsidiaries, we would face additional risks. Such action could cause concern among our customers and suppliers, distract our management and our other employees and subject us to increased risks of lawsuits. Other negative consequences could include negative publicity, which could have an impact on the trading price of our securities and affect our ability to raise capital in the future.\nIf we were to lose order volumes from any of our largest customers, our revenues and cash flows could be materially reduced.\nOur business is exposed to risks related to customer concentration. In 2014, our ten largest customers were responsible for approximately 41% of our consolidated revenues. In 2014, one customer accounted for approximately 9% of our consolidated revenues. A loss of order volumes from, or a loss of industry share by, any major customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations by lowering sales volumes, increasing costs and lowering profitability. In addition, our customers may become involved in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or default on their obligations to us.\nWe do not have long-term contractual arrangements with a significant majority of our customers, and our revenues and cash flows could be reduced if our customers decide to use other suppliers.\nA majority of our customer contracts have a term of one year or less. Many of our customers purchase products and services from us on a purchase order basis and may choose not to continue to purchase our products and services. The loss of these customers or a\nsignificant reduction in their purchase orders could have a material and adverse impact on our sales volume and business, or cause us to reduce our prices, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business requires substantial capital investments that we may be unable to fulfill.\nOur operations are capital intensive. Our capital expenditures were $93.5 million, $72.7 million and $87.9 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\nWe may not generate sufficient operating cash flows, and sufficient external financing sources may not be available to enable us to make required capital expenditures, service or refinance our indebtedness, pay dividends and fund other liquidity needs. Our inability to make upgrades or purchase new plant and equipment could result in higher maintenance costs, lower sales volumes due to the impact of reduced product quality and other competitive detriments, in which case our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nConstruction of our Rod mill at our New Madrid facility has been temporarily delayed. Substantial delay in the completion of, or failure to complete, this project may increase its cost, subject us to losses and impose other risks to completion that are not foreseeable at this time.\nConstruction of the Rod mill has been temporarily delayed in response to ongoing negotiations with Ameren. New Madrid cannot be certain when it will complete the Rod mill construction or if the New Madrid smelter would operate in a profitable manner. We will not realize any return on our significant investment in the Rod mill until we are able to commence operations in a profitable manner. If we fail to complete construction, we may have to recognize a loss on our investment, which would have a material adverse impact on our earnings.\nMany of the contractual arrangements related to the Rod mill have time periods for performance. The delay in restarting major construction and completing the Rod mill has caused New Madrid to renegotiate and extend, or undertake to renegotiate and extend, existing contractual commitments, including with respect to power, transmission, technology, equipment and construction. There can be no assurance that the contractual arrangements and conditions, including extensions, necessary to proceed with construction of the Rod mill will be obtained or satisfied on a timely basis or at all. Furthermore, unforeseen technical difficulties could increase the cost of the project, delay the project or render the project infeasible. Further delay in the completion of the project or increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We are scheduled to start production of the new Rod mill in December of 2015.\nWe may be required to write down the book value of certain assets.\nWe are required to perform various analyzes related to the carrying value of various assets whenever events or circumstances transpire, indicating that their net carrying amount may not be recoverable. We may need to significantly adjust the carrying value of our assets due to critical changes in our industry, global economic conditions and the extent that our assets are being utilized, all of which impact our assumptions used for the future in such analyses. We will continue to assess our assets for impairments, which could significantly impact their values. Any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operation.\nIf our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired in the future, we would be required to record a material, non-cash charge to earnings, which would also reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis (or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable) and other intangible assets if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. If our goodwill or other intangible assets are determined to be impaired in the future, we will be required to record a material, non-cash charge to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined.\nAdverse decline in pension liability discount rate, lower than expected investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect our results of operations or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods.\nOur results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, reductions in the fair value of plan assets and other factors. We are required to calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions, which may change based on changes in key economic indicators. The most significant year-end assumptions used to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant charge to shareholders\u2019 equity.\nAlthough U.S. GAAP expense and pension funding contributions are impacted by different regulations and requirements, the key economic factors that affect expense would also likely impact the amount of cash or securities we would contribute to the pension plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve\nthe plans\u2019 funded status. Adverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase our liabilities related to such plans, negatively impacting our liquidity and earnings.\nThe insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures.\nWe maintain property, casualty and workers\u2019 compensation insurance, but such insurance does not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We may incur losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of our insurance policies, including liabilities for environmental compliance or remediation. In addition, from time to time, various types of insurance for companies in our industries have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or, in some cases, have not been available at all. In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain. In addition, the 2009 power outage at our New Madrid smelter could have an impact on our ability in the future to obtain insurance at similar levels and costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations present significant risk of injury or death. We may be subject to claims that are not covered by or exceed our insurance.\nBecause of the heavy industrial activities conducted at our facilities, there exists a risk of injury or death to our employees or other visitors, notwithstanding the safety precautions we take. Our operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies responsible for employee health and safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which in the past has levied fines against us for certain isolated incidents. While we have in place policies to minimize such risks, we may nevertheless be unable to avoid material liabilities for any employee death or injury that may occur in the future. These types of incidents may not be covered by or may exceed our insurance coverage and could materially and adversely effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be materially and adversely affected by environmental, safety, production and product regulations or concerns.\nOur operations are subject to a wide variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those governing emissions to air, discharges to waters, generation, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, land reclamation and employee health and safety. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can be costly, and we have incurred and will continue to incur costs, including capital expenditures, to comply with these requirements. Additionally, certain of our raw material suppliers may be subject to significant environmental compliance costs, which they may pass through to us. As these direct or indirect regulatory costs increase and are passed through to our customers, our products may become less competitive than other materials, which could reduce our sales. If we are unable to comply with environmental laws and regulations, we could incur substantial costs, including fines and civil or criminal sanctions, or costs associated with upgrades to our facilities or changes in our manufacturing processes in order to achieve and maintain compliance. In addition, environmental requirements change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We cannot predict what environmental laws or regulations will be enacted or amended in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be interpreted or enforced, or the amount of future expenditures that may be required to comply with such laws or regulations. Our costs of compliance with current and future environmental requirements could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) has developed National Ambient Air Quality Standards (\u201cNAAQS\u201d) for six compounds currently identified as criteria pollutants. The NAAQS establishes acceptable ambient air levels of each pollutant based on a review of their effects on human health and the environment. Sulfur dioxide (\u201cSO2\u201d), an emission from our New Madrid smelter facility, is one such criteria pollutant. To determine our smelter\u2019s compliance with NAAQS, we measure emissions using currently acceptable methods.\nIn 2010, the EPA issued regulations that increased the stringency of the SO2 NAAQS. Federal and state regulators are in the process of developing measurement methods and time-lines that will govern the implementation of those regulations. Once finalized, these implementation requirements may present material implications for our smelter\u2019s compliance with NAAQS. Failure to meet NAAQS may require us to incur material capital and operational costs to bring our smelter into compliance and could have negative implications for permits necessary to support increases in production volumes at our smelter.\nIn addition, as an owner and operator of real property and a generator of hazardous waste, we may be subject to environmental cleanup liability, regardless of fault, pursuant to Superfund or analogous state or non-U.S. laws. Thus, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs and costs arising from third-party property damage or personal injury claims, relating to environmental contamination at properties currently or formerly operated by us or at third-party sites at which wastes from our operations have been disposed. Contaminants have been discovered in the soil and/or groundwater at some of our facilities. The discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at these or other sites could result in significant liability. In addition, because we use or process hazardous substances in our operations, we may be liable for personal injury claims or workers\u2019 compensation claims relating to exposure to hazardous substances.\nWe have identified certain environmental matters, which are disclosed in our consolidated financial statements to the extent they represent liabilities as defined by U.S. GAAP. There could be other significant environmental issues of which we are not aware. The occurrence of new environmental issues could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nClimate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our operations and markets.\nIn several of our operations, we consume energy generated from fossil fuel sources such as coal, diesel and natural gas. A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes in response to a view that consumption of energy derived from fossil fuels is a contributor to global warming. Regulatory and legislative changes may impact our operations directly or indirectly through customers or our supply chain. Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain. We may experience increased capital expenditures requirements in order to comply with revised or new legislation or regulations, increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage to favor carbon risk management, among other actions, a change in competitive position relative to industry peers and changes in the demand for the goods we produce, or increases to our raw material input costs.\nSome of our facilities are located in areas that have been subject to natural disasters. Future natural disasters in these areas could damage our facilities and disrupt our operations.\nOur aluminum smelter is located in New Madrid, Missouri on the banks of the Mississippi River and near the New Madrid fault line, in an area that may be subject to natural disasters such as floods, tornadoes, ice storms and earthquakes. When such a disaster occurs, it can damage the facility in question, or lead to interruptions in our power supply, which may disrupt our production of aluminum. Our bauxite mining operation is located in St. Ann, Jamaica and our alumina refinery is located in Gramercy, Louisiana, areas that may be exposed to hurricanes. In addition, our other facilities may be subject to natural disasters. We maintain insurance to protect us from events that may be caused by floods, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes in amounts that we believe are commercially reasonable. There can be no assurance, however, that such insurance would be available on a timely basis or adequate to completely reimburse us for the losses that might be sustained or to provide funds for the reconstruction of our facilities, and in any event such insurance would not enable us to immediately reconstruct our facilities to avoid a suspension or disruption of our business while reconstruction proceeded to completion or alternative sourcing is located. In addition, any hedging arrangements could require us to deliver aluminum even if we are unable to produce such aluminum, which could cause us to incur unexpected costs in purchasing aluminum on the open market.\nOur business is subject to unplanned business interruptions that may adversely affect our performance.\nThe production of aluminum is subject to unplanned events such as accidents, supply interruptions, transportation interruptions, human error, mechanical failure, information system breakdowns and other contingencies. Operational malfunctions or interruptions at one or more of our facilities could cause substantial losses in our production capacity. As such events occur, we may experience substantial business loss and the need to purchase one of our integrated raw materials at prices substantially higher than our normal cost of production, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, our vertical integration may cause operational malfunctions or interruptions at a facility in our Upstream Business to materially and adversely affect the performance or operation of the facilities further along our integrated production chain. Such interruptions may harm our reputation among actual and potential customers, potentially resulting in a loss of business. Although we maintain property and business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from catastrophic events, we may be required to pay significant amounts under the deductible provisions of those insurance policies. In addition, our coverage may not be sufficient to cover all losses, or may not cover certain events. To the extent these losses are not covered by insurance, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nCyber attacks and security breaches may threaten the integrity of our sensitive information, disrupt our business operations, and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nCyber security attacks and security breaches may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, computer viruses, denial of service and other electronic security breaches. These could range from uncoordinated individual attempts to advanced persistent threats directed at us. We have experienced such attacks in the past, and based on information known to date, they have not had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. However, due to the evolving nature and sophistication of cybersecurity threats, the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. While we continually work to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use our systems or networks, compromise confidential or otherwise protected information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt our operations. The occurrence of such events could negatively impact our reputation and our competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, loss of business, potential liability and increased remediation costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe could experience labor disputes that disrupt our business.\nWe are a party to seven collective bargaining agreements with five different unions. Our collective bargaining agreements are with the following unions:\nIn the US: the United Steelworkers of America (\u201cUSWA\u201d); the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (\u201cIAMAW\u201d).\nAt St. Ann, Jamaica: the University and Allied Workers Union (\u201cUAWU\u201d); the Union of Technical, Administrative and Supervisory Personnel (\u201cUTASP\u201d); and the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union (\u201cBITU\u201d).\nAs customary in Jamaican labor practices, unions generally submit claims subsequent to the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements. Until a new agreement is ratified, we continue to operate under the terms of the expired agreement, and, once signed, the new agreement is retroactive to the previous expiration date.\nLabor negotiations for renewal of bargaining agreements may not conclude successfully and, in that case, may result in a significant increase in the cost of labor, or result in work stoppages or labor disturbances, disrupting our operations. Any such cost increases, stoppages or disturbances could materially limit plant production, sales volumes and profitability, in which case our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur operations have been and will continue to be exposed to various business and other risks, changes in conditions and events beyond our control in foreign countries.\nWe have production activities outside the United States via our bauxite mining operation in St. Ann, Jamaica. We are, and will continue to be, subject to financial, political, economic and business risks in connection with our foreign operations. These risks include those associated with political or financial instability, expropriation, renegotiation or nullification of agreements, and changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to taxation, employment regulations and repatriation of earnings. While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict and beyond our control, any one or more of them could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. In addition to the business risks inherent in operating outside the United States, economic conditions may be more volatile, legal and regulatory systems less developed and predictable and the possibility of various types of adverse governmental action more pronounced. We are attempting to negotiate with the GOJ a new fiscal structure; an unfavorable outcome, including an inability to reach an agreement, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The terms of any new fiscal structure, as well as our ability to utilize all or part of the prepaid taxes, are subject to the outcome of the negotiations of any new fiscal structure or to the determination of our rights and obligations in connection with the existing arrangements. See Note 20, \u201cNon-Controlling Interest\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, our revenues, expenses, cash flows and results of operations could be affected by matters in foreign countries that more generally affect the global market for primary aluminum products, including inflation, fluctuations in currency and interest rates, competitive factors, civil unrest and labor problems. Our operations and the commercial markets for our products could also be materially and adversely affected by acts of war, terrorism or the threat of any of these events as well as government actions such as controls on imports, exports and prices, tariffs, new forms of taxation or changes in fiscal regimes and increased government regulation in countries engaged in the manufacture or consumption of aluminum products. Unexpected or uncontrollable events or circumstances in any of these markets could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may not be able to successfully realize our liquidity, CORE, performance, safety, or capital expansion project goals established at the levels or by the dates targeted by such goals.\nWe have established targets for each of our segments and company as a whole, which includes but is not limited to our liquidity, CORE, performance, safety and capital expansion project goals. For more information regarding our targets, see Part II, Item 7. (Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) of this report. There can be no assurance that any of these targets or other goals will be completed as anticipated. Market conditions or other factors may prevent us from accomplishing our goals at the levels or by the dates targeted, if at all, and failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or the market price of our securities.\nPast and future acquisitions or divestitures may adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs part of our strategy, we may continue to pursue acquisitions, divestitures or strategic alliances, which may not be completed or, if completed, may not be ultimately beneficial to us. There are numerous risks commonly encountered in business combinations, including the risk that we may not be able to complete a transaction that has been announced, effectively integrate businesses acquired or generate the cost savings and synergies anticipated. Failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe loss of certain members of our management may have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur success will depend, in part, on the efforts of our senior management and other key employees. These individuals possess sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, financial and administrative skills that are critical to the operation of our business. If we lose or suffer an extended interruption in the services of one or more of our senior officers, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, the market for qualified individuals may be highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to replace or succeed members of our senior management or other key employees, should the need arise.\nApollo has the ability to substantially influence our company and the outcome of matters voted upon by our shareholders, and to prevent actions which a shareholder may otherwise view favorably.\nAs of December 31, 2014, Apollo owned approximately 33.1% of our common stock. As long as Apollo owns more than 10% of our common stock, it will have the right to cause the Board of Directors to nominate to our Board of Directors at least four Apollo designees. Thus, Apollo has the ability to significantly influence our decisions.\nThe interests of Apollo could conflict with or differ from stockholder interests as a holder of our common stock. For example, the concentration of ownership held by Apollo could delay, defer or prevent a change of control of Noranda or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination that stockholders or debtholders may otherwise view favorably. Additionally, Apollo is in the business of making or advising on investments in companies and holds, and may from time to time in the future acquire interests in, or provide advice to, businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours. Apollo may also pursue acquisitions that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. A sale of a substantial number of shares of stock in the future by funds affiliated with Apollo could cause our stock price to decline.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nWe have substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from servicing our debt.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our total indebtedness was $668.0 million. Based on the amount of indebtedness outstanding at December 31, 2014 and the interest rates in effect on such date, our 2015 estimated cash interest expense is approximately $50.0 million, some of which represents interest expense on floating-rate obligations and is subject to increase in the event interest rates rise.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on their and our debt depends on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside their and our control. Our subsidiaries\u2019 inability to generate cash flow sufficient to satisfy their and our debt obligations, or to refinance their and our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could require us and our subsidiaries to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nraise additional capital through debt or equity issuances or both;\n\u2022\ncancel or scale back current and future business initiatives; or\n\u2022\nsell businesses or properties.\nOur and our subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow money for our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nrequiring our subsidiaries to dedicate a portion of their cash flow to payments on their and our indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, product development and other corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to our less leveraged competitors;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to respond to business opportunities; and\n\u2022\nsubjecting us and our subsidiaries to restrictive covenants, which, if not complied with, could result in an event of default under their and our debt; if the default is not cured or waived, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nRestrictive covenants under the indenture governing our AcquisitionCo Notes and our senior secured credit facilities may restrict and adversely affect our operational flexibility.\nThe indenture governing the AcquisitionCo Notes and our senior secured credit facilities contain, and any future indebtedness we incur may contain, a number of restrictive covenants that could impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, including restrictions on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions to our shareholders;\n\u2022\nrepurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake loans, acquisitions or investments;\n\u2022\nsell assets including stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022\nengage in certain business activities.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nA failure to comply with the covenants contained in our senior secured credit facilities, the indenture governing the AcquisitionCo Notes or any future indebtedness could result in an event of default under the senior secured credit facilities, the indenture governing the AcquisitionCo Notes or such future indebtedness, which, if not cured or waived, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The events of default contained in our existing indebtedness are customary for senior secured credit facilities and indentures of companies similar to the Company. Certain of such events of default, generally defaults based on volitional acts that violate prohibitions on our taking certain actions such as incurring debt or paying dividends beyond permitted amounts, are not subject to notice or cure periods. In the event of any default under the senior secured credit facilities, the indenture governing the AcquisitionCo Notes or any future material indebtedness, our and our subsidiaries\u2019 debt holders and lenders:\n\u2022\nwill not be required to lend any additional amounts to us and our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ncould elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable;\n\u2022\nmay have the ability to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings; or\n\u2022\nmay prevent us and our subsidiaries from making debt service payments under our and our subsidiaries\u2019 other agreements, any of which could result in an event of default under such agreements.\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Description of Certain Indebtedness,\u201d in Item 7 of this report.\nDespite our substantial indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur significantly more debt. This could increase the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our indebtedness.\nThe indenture governing the AcquisitionCo Notes and our senior secured credit facilities contain restrictions on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur additional indebtedness. These restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Accordingly, we and our subsidiaries could incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, much of which could constitute secured or senior indebtedness. The more leveraged we and our subsidiaries become, the more we and our subsidiaries, and in turn our security holders, become exposed to the risks described above under the heading \u201cWe have substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from servicing our debt.\u201d\nOur variable-rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nCertain of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness, including borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, are subject to variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Description of Certain Indebtedness,\u201d in Item 7 of this report. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase, even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income would decrease. Although we may enter into interest rate swaps, involving the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments, to reduce interest rate volatility, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so.\nBased on the amount of indebtedness outstanding at December 31, 2014 and the interest rates in effect on such date, our 2015 estimated cash interest expense is approximately $50.0 million for 2015. A 1% increase in the interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by an estimated $4.7 million, excluding the senior fixed rate notes.\nAny further downgrade of our credit ratings could limit our ability to obtain future financing, increasing our borrowing costs, increase the pricing of our credit facilities, adversely affect the market price of our securities, trigger letter of credit or other collateral postings, or otherwise impair our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, Standard and Poor\u2019s lowered our credit rating to B- from B. There can be no assurance that one or more other rating agencies will not take further negative actions with respect to our ratings. Increased debt levels, adverse aluminum market or macroeconomic conditions, a contraction in the Company\u2019s liquidity, or other factors could potentially trigger such actions. A rating agency may lower, suspend or withdraw entirely a rating or place it on negative outlook or watch if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances so warrant.\nAny additional or further downgrade of our credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could also adversely impact the market price of our securities, adversely affect existing financing, limit access to the capital or credit markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms, result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that the Company incurs, increase the cost of borrowing or fees on undrawn credit facilities, result in vendors or counterparties seeking collateral or letters of credit from us, or otherwise impair our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 93382, "SIC": 3334, "TIC": "NORNQ"}
