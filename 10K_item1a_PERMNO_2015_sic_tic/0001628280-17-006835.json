{"cik": "1173204", "company": "Cinedigm Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-06-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe maintain a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness, which could impair our ability to operate our business and react to changes in our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt.\nWe maintain a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness, which could impair our ability to operate our business and react to changes in our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to pursue our growth strategy or, including restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less leveraged and may be better able to use their cash flow to fund competitive responses to changing industry, market or economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business, our industry or the economy in general.\nIn addition, our current credit facilities contain, and any future credit facilities will likely contain, covenants and other provisions that restrict our operations. These restrictive covenants and provisions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities, and may prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise in the future. If we refinance our credit facilities, we cannot guarantee that any new credit facility will not contain similar covenants and restrictions.\nWe face the risks of doing business in new and rapidly evolving markets and may not be able successfully to address such risks and achieve acceptable levels of success or profits.\nWe have encountered and may continue to encounter the challenges, uncertainties and difficulties frequently experienced in new and rapidly evolving markets, including:\n\u2022\nlimited operating experience;\n\u2022\nnet losses;\n\u2022\nlack of sufficient customers or loss of significant customers;\n\u2022\na changing business focus;\n\u2022\nthe downward trend in sales of physical DVD and Blu-ray discs;\n\u2022\nrapidly-changing technology for some of the products and services we offer; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing potentially rapid growth.\nWe expect competition to be intense. If we are unable to compete successfully, our business and results of operations will be seriously harmed.\nThe markets for the digital cinema business and the content distribution business are competitive, evolving and subject to rapid technological and other changes. We expect the intensity of competition in each of these areas to increase in the future. Companies willing to expend the necessary capital to create facilities and/or capabilities similar to ours may compete with our business. Increased competition may result in reduced revenues and/or margins and loss of market share, any of which could seriously harm our business. In order to compete effectively in each of these fields, we must differentiate ourselves from competitors.\nMany of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do, which may permit them to adopt aggressive pricing policies. As a result, we may suffer from pricing pressures that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and our results of operations. Many of our competitors also have significantly greater name and brand recognition and a larger customer base than us. If we are unable to compete successfully, our business and results of operations will be seriously harmed.\nOur plan to acquire additional businesses involves risks, including our inability to complete an acquisition successfully, our assumption of liabilities, dilution of your investment and significant costs.\nStrategic and financially appropriate acquisitions are a key component of our growth strategy. Although there are no other acquisitions identified by us as probable at this time, we may make further acquisitions of similar or complementary businesses or assets. Even if we identify appropriate acquisition candidates, we may be unable to negotiate successfully the terms of the acquisitions, finance them, integrate the acquired business into our then existing business and/or attract and retain customers. Completing an acquisition and integrating an acquired business may require a significant diversion of management time and resources and may involve assuming new liabilities. Any acquisition also involves the risks that the assets acquired may prove less valuable than expected and/or that we may assume unknown or unexpected liabilities, costs and problems. If we make one or more significant acquisitions in which any of the consideration consists of our capital stock, your equity interest in the Company could be diluted, perhaps significantly. If we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash, we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash, or obtain additional financing to consummate them.\nOur previous acquisitions involve risks, including our inability to integrate successfully the new businesses and our assumption of certain liabilities.\nOur acquisition of these businesses and their respective assets also involved the risks that the businesses and assets acquired may prove to be less valuable than we expected and/or that we may assume unknown or unexpected liabilities, costs and problems. In addition, we assumed certain liabilities in connection with these acquisitions and we cannot assure you that we will be able to satisfy adequately such assumed liabilities. Other companies that offer similar products and services may be able to market and sell their products and services more cost-effectively than we can.\nWe have recorded goodwill impairment charges and may be required to record additional charges to future earnings if our goodwill becomes further impaired or our intangible assets become impaired.\nWe are required under generally accepted accounting principles to review our goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our reporting units and intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, slower growth rates in our industry or our own operations, and/or other materially adverse events that have implications on the profitability of our business. In fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $18.0 million in our Content & Entertainment operating segment. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details. We may be required to record additional charges to earnings during any period in which a further impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets is determined which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we do not manage our growth, our business will be harmed.\nWe may not be successful in managing our growth. Past growth has placed, and future growth will continue to place, significant challenges on our management and resources, related to the successful integration of the newly acquired businesses. To manage the expected growth of our operations, we will need to improve our existing, and implement new, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. We may also need to expand our finance, administrative, client services and operations staffs and train and manage our growing employee base effectively. Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. Our business, results of operations and financial position will suffer if we do not effectively manage our growth.\nIf we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property, our business will suffer.\nWe depend heavily on technology and viewing content to operate our business. Our success depends on protecting our intellectual property, which is one of our most important assets. We have intellectual property consisting of:\n\u2022\nrights to certain domain names;\n\u2022\nregistered service marks on certain names and phrases;\n\u2022\nvarious unregistered trademarks and service marks;\n\u2022\nfilm, television and other forms of viewing content;\n\u2022\nknow-how; and\n\u2022\nrights to certain logos.\nIf we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, our business, financial position and results of operations would be harmed. Our means of protecting our intellectual property may not be adequate. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our\nintellectual property or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, competitors may be able to devise methods of competing with our business that are not covered by our intellectual property. Our competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our technology or design around any intellectual property that we may obtain.\nAlthough we hold rights to various web domain names, regulatory bodies in the United States and abroad could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. The relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to or diminish the value of our proprietary rights.\nOur substantial debt and lease obligations could impair our financial flexibility and restrict our business significantly.\nWe now have, and will continue to have, significant debt obligations. In October 2013, we entered into the Cinedigm Credit Agreement pursuant to which we borrowed Term Loans in the aggregate amount of $25.0 million and had the ability to borrow revolving loans and have letters of credit issued in an aggregate amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed $30.0 million. In April 2015, we repaid and terminated the term loan in its entirety, and in May 2016, we reduced the capacity of the revolving loans to $22.0 million and in July 2016, we further reduced the borrowing capacity of such loans to $19.8 million. The obligations under the Cinedigm Credit Agreement, as amended and restated, are with full recourse to Cinedigm. As of March 31, 2017, principal amount outstanding under the Cinedigm Credit Agreement was $19.6 million. Additionally, in October 2013, we issued $5.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes (the \u201c2013 Notes\u201d), which debt is unsecured and subordinate to the debt under the Cinedigm Credit Agreement. In April 2015, we issued $64.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d), of which $50.6 million is outstanding as of March 31, 2017. The Convertible Notes are unsecured and subordinate to the debt under the Cinedigm Credit Agreement and senior to the 2013 Notes. In July, September and October 2016 and January and February 2017, we issued $9.0 million aggregate principal amount of 12.75% Second Secured Lien Notes due 2019 (the \u201cSecond Secured Lien Notes,\u201d which debt is secured on a second lien basis and is subordinate to the debt under the Cinedigm Credit Agreement, pari passu (other than as to the collateral) with the Convertible Notes and senior to the 2013 Notes.\nAs of March 31, 2017, total indebtedness of our consolidated subsidiaries (not including guarantees of our debt) was $63.8 million, none of which is guaranteed by Cinedigm Corp. or our subsidiaries, other than CDF I with respect to the Phase I Credit Agreement, DC Holdings LLC, AccessDM and ADCP2 with respect to the Prospect Loan, and Phase 2 B/AIX with respect to the KBC Agreements. In connection with the Prospect Loan, we provided a limited recourse guaranty pursuant to which Cinedigm guaranteed certain representations and warranties and performance obligations with respect to the Prospect Loan in favor of the collateral agent and the administrative agent for the Prospect Loan. Cinedigm Corp. has provided a limited recourse guaranty in respect of a portion of this indebtedness ($54.7 million as of March 31, 2017) pursuant to which it agreed to become a primary obligor of such indebtedness in certain specified circumstances, none of which have occurred as of the date hereof.\nWe also had capital lease obligations covering a facility and computer equipment with an aggregate principal amount of $0.1 million as of March 31, 2017. On October 28, 2016, we entered into an agreement to fully terminate our lease obligation on the Pavilion Theater, a facility that was accounted for as a capital lease and for which we were considered the primary obligor. Contemporaneously, we also terminated a sublease agreement that we had with the tenant of the Pavilion Theater.\nIn February 2013, DC Holdings LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into the Prospect Loan in the aggregate principal amount of $70.0 million. Additionally, in February 2013, CDF I, our indirect wholly owned subsidiary that is intended to be a special purpose, bankruptcy remote entity, amended and restated the Phase I Credit Agreement, pursuant to which it borrowed $130.0 million of which $5.0 million was assigned to DC Holding LLC. As of March 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount of the Prospect Loan was $54.7 million. In November 2016, the Phase I Credit Agreement was repaid in full, and accordingly no amount remains outstanding as of March 31, 2017. Phase 2 B/AIX, our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, has entered into the KBC Agreements pursuant to which it has borrowed $65.3 million in the aggregate. As of March 31, 2017, the outstanding principal balance under the KBC Agreements was $8.6 million in the aggregate.\nThe obligations and restrictions under the Cinedigm Credit Agreement, the Prospect Loan, the KBC Agreements and our other debt obligations could have important consequences for us, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain necessary financing in the future; and\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt obligations, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate requirements or expansion of our business.\nCDF2 and CDF2 Holdings are our indirect wholly owned, non-consolidated VIEs that are intended to be special purpose, bankruptcy remote entities. CDF2 has entered into the Phase II Credit Agreement, pursuant to which it borrowed $63.2 million in the aggregate. As of March 31, 2017, the outstanding balance under the Phase II Credit Agreement, which includes interest payable, was $22.0 million. CDF2 Holdings has entered into the CHG Lease pursuant to which CHG provided sale/leaseback financing for digital cinema projection systems that were partially financed by the Phase II Credit Agreement in an amount of approximately $57.2 million in the aggregate. These facilities are non-recourse to Cinedigm and our subsidiaries, excluding our VIE, CDF2 and CDF2 Holdings, as the case may be. Although the Phase II financing arrangements undertaken by CDF2 and CDF2 Holdings are important to us with respect to the success of our Phase II Deployment, our financial exposure related to the debt of CDF2 and CDF2 Holdings is limited to the $2.0 million initial investment it made into CDF2 and CDF2 Holdings. CDF2 Holding\u2019s total stockholder\u2019s deficit at March 31, 2017 was $18.7 million. We have no obligation to fund the operating loss or the deficit beyond its initial investment, and accordingly, we carried our investment in CDF2 Holdings at $0 as of March 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe obligations and restrictions under the Phase II Credit Agreement and the CHG Lease could have important consequences for CDF2 and CDF2 Holdings, including:\n\u2022\nLimiting our ability to obtain necessary financing in the future; and\n\u2022\nrequiring them to dedicate a substantial portion of their cash flow to payments on their debt obligations, thereby reducing the availability of their cash flow for other uses.\nIf we are unable to meet our lease and debt obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our obligations, to seek additional equity financing or to sell assets, which we may not be able to do on satisfactory terms or at all. As a result, we could default on those obligations and in the event of such default, our lenders could accelerate our debt or take other actions that could restrict our operations.\nThe foregoing risks would be intensified to the extent we borrow additional money or incur additional debt.\nThe agreements governing the financing of our Phase I Deployment and part of our Phase II Deployment, the Cinedigm Credit Agreement and the Prospect Loan impose certain limitations on us.\nThe Cinedigm Credit Agreement restricts our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries that have guaranteed the obligations under the Cinedigm Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, to, among other things:\n\u2022\nmake certain capital expenditures and investments;\n\u2022\nincur other indebtedness or liens;\n\u2022\ncreate or acquire subsidiaries which do not guarantee the obligations or foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nengage in a new line of business;\n\u2022\npay dividends;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\namend certain agreements;\n\u2022\nacquire, consolidate with, or merge with or into other companies; and\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates.\nOne or more of the KBC Agreements governing part of the financing of our Phase II Deployment restrict the ability of Phase 2 B/AIX to, among other things:\n\u2022\ndispose of or incur other liens on the digital cinema projection systems financed by KBC;\n\u2022\nengage in a new line of business;\n\u2022\nsell assets outside the ordinary course of business or on other than arm\u2019s length terms;\n\u2022\nmake payments to majority owned affiliated companies; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate with, or merge with or into other companies.\nThe agreements governing the Prospect Loan restrict the ability of DC Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, to, among other things:\n\u2022\nmake certain capital expenditures and investments;\n\u2022\nincur other indebtedness or liens;\n\u2022\nengage in a new line of business;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nacquire, consolidate with, or merge with or into other companies; and\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates.\nThe agreements governing the financing of other parts of our Phase II Deployment impose certain limitations, which may affect our Phase 2 deployment.\nThe Phase II Credit Agreement governing part of the financing of part of our Phase II Deployment that has not been financed by the KBC Agreements restricts the ability of CDF2, CDF2 Holdings and their existing and future subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nmake certain capital expenditures and investments;\n\u2022\nincur other indebtedness or liens;\n\u2022\nengage in a new line of business;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nacquire, consolidate with, or merge with or into other companies; and\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates.\nThe CHG Lease governing part of the financing of part of our Phase II Deployment restricts the ability of CDF2 Holdings to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur liens on the digital cinema projection systems financed; and\n\u2022\nsublease, assign or modify the digital cinema projection systems financed.\nWe may not be able to generate the amount of cash needed to fund our future operations.\nOur ability either to make payments on or to refinance our indebtedness, or to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our ability to generate cash is in part subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nBased on our current level of operations and in conjunction with the cost reduction measures that we have recently implemented and continue to implement, we believe our cash flow from operations, available borrowings and loan and credit agreement terms will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs through at least March 31, 2018. Significant assumptions underlie this belief, including, among other things, that there will be no material adverse developments in our business, liquidity or capital requirements. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include actions such as:\n\u2022\nreducing capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nreducing our overhead costs and/or workforce;\n\u2022\nreducing research and development efforts;\n\u2022\nselling assets;\n\u2022\nrestructuring or refinancing our remaining indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nseeking additional funding.\nWe cannot assure you, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that we will be able to make future borrowings in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay the principal and interest on our current indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nWe have incurred losses since our inception.\nWe have incurred losses since our inception in March 2000 and have financed our operations principally through equity investments and borrowings. As of March 31, 2017, we had negative working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of $15.4 million, and cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash totaling $13.6 million; we have total stockholders' deficit of $70.7 million; however, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, we generated $31.7 million of net cash flows from operating activities.\nOur net losses and cash outflows may increase as and to the extent that we increase the size of our business operations, increase our sales and marketing activities, increase our content distribution rights acquisition activities, enlarge our customer support and professional services and acquire additional businesses. These efforts may prove to be more expensive than we currently anticipate which could further increase our losses. We must continue to increase our revenues in order to become profitable. We cannot\nreliably predict when, or if, we will become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it. If we cannot generate operating income or positive cash flows in the future, we will be unable to meet our working capital requirements.\nMany of our corporate actions may be controlled by our officers, directors and principal stockholders; these actions may benefit these principal stockholders more than our other stockholders.\nAs of March 31, 2017, our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, those known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of the outstanding shares of the Class A common stock, beneficially own, directly or indirectly, in the aggregate, approximately 51.3% of our outstanding Class A common stock. In particular, Chris McGurk, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, owns 510,740 shares of Class A common stock and has stock options to purchase 600,000 shares of Class A common stock, all of which are vested. If all the options were exercised, Mr. McGurk would own 1,110,740 shares or approximately 8.9% of the then-outstanding Class A common stock. In addition, Ronald L. Chez, a former director and a current strategic advisor to the Board, owns 1,362,171 shares of Class A common stock and warrants to purchase 297,500 shares of Class A common stock. If such warrants were exercised, Mr. Chez would own 1,659,671 shares or approximately 13.7% of the Class A common stock.\nThese stockholders may have significant influence over our business affairs, with the ability to control matters requiring approval by our security holders, including elections of directors and approvals of mergers or other business combinations. In addition, certain corporate actions directed by our officers may not necessarily inure to the proportional benefit of our other stockholders.\nOur success will significantly depend on our ability to hire and retain key personnel.\nOur success will depend in significant part upon the continued performance of our senior management personnel and other key technical, sales and creative personnel. We do not currently have significant \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies for any of our employees. We currently have employment agreements with our chief executive officer. If we lose one or more of our key employees, we may not be able to find a suitable replacement(s) and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, competition for key employees necessary to create and distribute our entertainment content and software products is intense and may grow in the future. Our future success will also depend upon our ability to hire, train, integrate and retain qualified new employees and our inability to do so may have an adverse impact upon our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects for growth.\nIf we do not respond to future changes in technology and customer demands, our financial position, prospects and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe demand for our Systems and other assets in connection with our digital cinema business (collectively, our \u201cDigital Cinema Assets\u201d) may be affected by future advances in technology and changes in customer demands. We cannot assure you that there will be continued demand for our Digital Cinema Assets. Our profitability depends largely upon the continued use of digital presentations at theatres. Although we have entered into long term agreements with major motion picture studios and independent studios (the \u201cStudio Agreements\u201d), there can be no assurance that these studios will continue to distribute digital content to movie theatres. If the development of digital presentations and changes in the way digital files are delivered does not continue or technology is used that is not compatible with our Systems, there may be no viable market for our Systems and related products. Any reduction in the use of our Systems and related products resulting from the development and deployment of new technology may negatively impact our revenues and the value of our Systems.\nThe demand for DVD products is declining, and we anticipate that this decline will continue. We anticipate, however, that the distribution of DVD products will continue to generate positive cash flows for the Company for the foreseeable future. Should a decline in consumer demand be greater than we anticipate, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have concentration in our digital cinema business with respect to our major motion picture studio customers, and the loss of one or more of our largest studio customers could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur Studio Agreements account for a significant portion of our revenues within Phase 1 DC and Phase 2 DC. Together these studios generated 58%, 64%, and 21% of Phase 1 DC\u2019s, Phase 2 DC\u2019s and our consolidated revenues, respectively, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.\nThe Studio Agreements are critical to our business. If some of the Studio Agreements were terminated prior to the end of their terms or found to be unenforceable, or if our Systems are not upgraded or enhanced as necessary, or if we had a material failure of our Systems, it may have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability, financial condition and cash flows. The Studio Agreements also generally provide that the VPF rates and other material terms of the agreements may not be more favorable to one studio as compared to the others.\nTermination of the MLAs and MLAAs could damage our revenue and profitability.\nThe master license agreements with each of our licensed exhibitors (the \u201cMLAs\u201d) are critical to our business as are master license administrative agreements (the \u201cMLAAs\u201d). The MLAs have terms, which expire in 2020 through 2022 and provide the exhibitor with an option to purchase our Systems or to renew for successive one-year periods up to ten years thereafter. The MLAs also require our suppliers to upgrade our Systems when technology necessary for compliance with DCI Specification becomes commercially available and we may determine to enhance the Systems, which may require additional capital expenditures. If any one of the MLAs were terminated prior to the end of its term, not renewed at its expiration or found to be unenforceable, or if our Systems are not upgraded or enhanced as necessary, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, termination of MLAAs could adversely impact our servicing business.\nWe have concentration in our business with respect to our major licensed exhibitors, and the loss of one or more of our largest exhibitors could have a material adverse effect on us.\nApproximately 64% of Phase 1 DC\u2019s Systems and 19% of total systems are under MLA in theatres owned or operated by one large exhibitor. The loss of this exhibitor or another of our major licensed exhibitors could have a negative impact on the aggregate receipt of VPF revenues as a result of the loss of any associated MLAs. Although we do not receive revenues from licensed exhibitors and we have attempted to limit our licenses to only those theatres, which we believe are successful, each MLA with our licensed exhibitors is important, depending on the number of screens, to our business since VPF revenues are generated based on screen turnover at theatres. If the MLA with a significant exhibitor was terminated prior to the end of its term, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability, financial condition and cash flows. There can be no guarantee that the MLAs with our licensed exhibitors will not be terminated prior to the end of its term.\nAn increase in the use of alternative movie distribution channels and other competing forms of entertainment could drive down movie theatre attendance, which, if causing significant theatre closures or a substantial decline in motion picture production, may lead to reductions in our revenues.\nVarious exhibitor chains, which are our distributors, face competition for patrons from a number of alternative motion picture distribution channels, such as DVD, network and syndicated television, VOD, pay-per-view television and downloading utilizing the Internet. These exhibitor chains also compete with other forms of entertainment competing for patrons\u2019 leisure time and disposable income such as concerts, amusement parks and sporting events. An increase in popularity of these alternative movie distribution channels and competing forms of entertainment could drive down movie theatre attendance and potentially cause certain of our exhibitors to close their theatres for extended periods of time. Significant theatre closures could in turn have a negative impact on the aggregate receipt of our VPF revenues, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to service our debt.\nAn increase in the use of alternative movie distribution channels could also cause the overall production of motion pictures to decline, which, if substantial, could have an adverse effect on the businesses of the major studios with which we have Studio Agreements. A decline in the businesses of the major studios could in turn force the termination of certain Studio Agreements prior to the end of their terms. The Studio Agreements with each of the major studios are critical to our business, and their early termination may have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur success depends on external factors in the motion picture and television industry.\nOur success depends on the commercial success of movies and television programs, which is unpredictable. Operating in the motion picture and television industry involves a substantial degree of risk. Each movie and television program is an individual artistic work, and inherently unpredictable audience reactions primarily determine commercial success. Generally, the popularity of movies and television programs depends on many factors, including the critical acclaim they receive, the format of their initial release, for example, theatrical or direct-to-video, the actors and other key talent, their genre and their specific subject matter. The commercial success of movies and television programs also depends upon the quality and acceptance of movies or programs that our competitors release into the marketplace at or near the same time, critical reviews, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure activities, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, many of which we do not control and all of which may change. We cannot predict the future effects of these factors with certainty, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects. In addition, because a movie\u2019s or television program\u2019s performance in ancillary markets, such as home video and pay and free television, is often directly related to its box office performance or television ratings, poor box office results or poor television ratings may negatively affect future revenue streams. Our success will depend on the experience and judgment of our management to select and develop new content acquisition and investment opportunities. We cannot make assurances that movies and television programs will obtain favorable reviews or ratings, will perform well at the box office or in ancillary markets or that broadcasters will license the rights\nto broadcast any of our television programs in development or renew licenses to broadcast programs in our library. The failure to achieve any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nOur business involves risks of liability claims for media content, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a distributor of media content, we may face potential liability for:\n\u2022\ndefamation;\n\u2022\ninvasion of privacy;\n\u2022\nnegligence;\n\u2022\ncopyright or trademark infringement (as discussed above); and\n\u2022\nother claims based on the nature and content of the materials distributed.\nThese types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against producers and distributors of media content. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nOur revenues and earnings are subject to market downturns.\nOur revenues and earnings may fluctuate significantly in the future. General economic or other conditions could cause lower than expected revenues and earnings within our digital cinema, technology or content and entertainment businesses. The global economic turmoil of recent years has caused a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, an unprecedented level of intervention from the U.S. federal government and other foreign governments, decreased consumer confidence, overall slower economic activity and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets. While the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted, a decrease in economic activity in the U.S. or in other regions of the world in which we do business could adversely affect demand for our movies, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. While stabilization has continued, it remains a slow process and the global economy remains subject to volatility. Moreover, financial institution failures may cause us to incur increased expenses or make it more difficult either to financing of any future acquisitions, or financing activities. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and could result in significant additional dilution to shareholders.\nChanges in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nOur operations and performance could be influenced by worldwide economic conditions. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on the demand for the our products and services. Other factors that could influence demand include continuing increases in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer-spending behavior. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and operating results. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions could also continue to increase the volatility of our stock price.\nChanges to existing accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may affect how we conduct our business and affect our reported results of operations.\nNew accounting pronouncements or tax rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future. A change in accounting pronouncements or interpretations or taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. Changes to existing rules and pronouncements, future changes, if any, or the questioning of current practices or interpretations may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to a forward stock purchase transaction.\nThe forward counterparty to the forward stock purchase transaction that we are party to is one of the lenders under the Cinedigm Credit Agreement, and we are subject to the risk that it might default under the forward stock purchase transaction. Our exposure to the credit risk of the forward counterparty will not be secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have in the recent\npast resulted in, and may again result in, the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If the forward counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings, with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transaction with that counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors, but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, upon default by the forward counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our Class A common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the forward counterparty to the forward stock purchase transaction.\nRisks Related to our Class A Common Stock\nThe liquidity of the Class A common stock is uncertain; the limited trading volume of the Class A common stock may depress the price of such stock or cause it to fluctuate significantly.\nAlthough the Class A common stock is listed on Nasdaq, there has been a limited public market for the Class A common stock and there can be no assurance that a more active trading market for the Common Stock will develop. As a result, you may not be able to sell your shares of Class A common stock in short time periods, or possibly at all. The absence of an active trading market may cause the price per share of the Class A common stock to fluctuate significantly.\nSubstantial resales or future issuances of our Class A common stock could depress our stock price.\nThe market price for the Class A common stock could decline, perhaps significantly, as a result of resales or issuances of a large number of shares of the Class A common stock in the public market or even the perception that such resales or issuances could occur, including resales of the shares being registered hereunder pursuant to the registration statement of which this prospectus supplement is a part. In addition, we have outstanding a substantial number of options, warrants and other securities convertible into shares of Class A common stock that may be exercised in the future. Certain holders of our securities, including with respect to shares of Class A common stock issuable in exchange for warrants, have demand and piggy-back registration rights. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of our equity securities.\nYou will incur substantial dilution as a result of certain future equity issuances.\nWe have a substantial number of options, warrants and other securities currently outstanding which may be immediately exercised or converted into shares of Class A common stock. To the extent that these options, warrants or similar securities are exercised or converted, or to the extent we issue additional shares of Class A common stock in the future, as the case may be, there will be further dilution to holders of shares of the Class A common stock.\nOur issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of Class A common stock.\nOur board of directors is authorized to issue series of preferred stock without any action on the part of our holders of Class A common stock. Our board of directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences over our Class A common stock with respect to dividends or if we liquidate, dissolve or wind up our business and other terms. If we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our Class A common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our Class A common stock, the rights of holders of our Class A common stock or the price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe acquisition restrictions contained in our certificate of incorporation, which are intended to help preserve our net operating losses, may not be effective or may have unintended negative effects.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, substantial operating losses, and under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d), and rules promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service, we may \u201ccarry forward\u201d these net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) in certain circumstances to offset any current and future earnings and thus reduce our federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. To the extent that the NOLs do not otherwise become limited, we believe that we will be able to carry forward a significant amount of the NOLs, and therefore these NOLs could be a substantial asset to us. If, however, we experience a Section 382 ownership change, our ability to use the NOLs will be substantially limited, and the timing of the usage of the NOLs could be substantially delayed, which could therefore significantly impair the value of that asset.\nTo reduce the likelihood of an ownership change, we have established acquisition restrictions in our certificate of incorporation. The acquisition restrictions in our certificate of incorporation are intended to restrict certain acquisitions of the Class A common\nstock to help preserve our ability to utilize our NOLs by avoiding the limitations imposed by Section 382 and the related Treasury regulations. The acquisition restrictions are generally designed to restrict or deter direct and indirect acquisitions of the Class A common stock if such acquisition would result in a shareholder becoming a \u201c5-percent shareholder\u201d (as defined by Section 382 and the related Treasury regulations) or increase the percentage ownership of Company stock that is treated as owned by an existing 5-percent shareholder.\nAlthough the acquisition restrictions are intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change that could adversely affect us, we can give no assurance that such restrictions would prevent all transfers that could result in such an ownership change. In particular, we have been advised by our counsel that, absent a court determination, there can be no assurance that the acquisition restrictions will be enforceable against all of our shareholders, and that they may be subject to challenge on equitable grounds. In particular, it is possible that the acquisition restrictions may not be enforceable against the shareholders who voted against or abstained from voting on the restrictions at our 2009 annual meeting of stockholders.\nUnder certain circumstances, our Board may determine it is in our best interest to exempt certain 5-percent shareholders from the operation of the acquisition restrictions, if a proposed transaction is determined not to be detrimental to the utilization of our NOLs.\nThe acquisition restrictions also require any person attempting to become a holder of 5% or more of the Class A common stock, as determined under Section 382, to seek the approval of our Board. This may have an unintended \u201canti-takeover\u201d effect because our Board may be able to prevent any future takeover. Similarly, any limits on the amount of stock that a stockholder may own could have the effect of making it more difficult for stockholders to replace current management. Additionally, because the acquisition restrictions have the effect of restricting a stockholder\u2019s ability to dispose of or acquire the Class A common stock, the liquidity and market value of the Class A common stock might suffer. The acquisition restrictions may be waived by our Board. Stockholders are advised to monitor carefully their ownership of the Class A common stock and consult their own legal advisors and/or Company to determine whether their ownership of the Class A common stock approaches the proscribed level.\nThe occurrence of various events may adversely affect our ability to fully utilize NOLs.\nWe have a substantial amount of NOLs for U.S. federal income tax purposes that are available both currently and in the future to offset taxable income and gains. Events outside of our control may cause us to experience a Section 382 ownership change, and limit our ability to fully utilize such NOLs.\nIn general, an ownership change occurs when, as of any testing date, the percentage of stock of a corporation owned by one or more \u201c5-percent shareholders,\u201d as defined in the Section 382 and the related Treasury regulations, has increased by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of stock of the corporation owned by such shareholders at any time during the three-year period preceding such date. In general, persons who own 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s stock are 5-percent shareholders, and all other persons who own less than 5% of a corporation\u2019s stock are treated, together, as a single, public group 5-percent shareholder, regardless of whether they own an aggregate of 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s stock. If a corporation experiences an ownership change, it is generally subject to an annual limitation, which limits its ability to use its NOLs to an amount equal to the equity value of the corporation multiplied by the federal long-term tax-exempt rate.\nIf we were to experience an ownership change, we could potentially have, in the future, higher U.S. federal income tax liabilities than we would otherwise have had and it may also result in certain other adverse consequences to us. Therefore, we have adopted the acquisition restrictions set forth in Article Fourth of our certificate of incorporation in order to reduce the likelihood that we will experience an ownership change under Section 382. There can be no assurance, however, that these efforts will deter or prevent the occurrence of an ownership change and the adverse consequences that may arise therefrom, as described above under the risk factor titled \u201cThe acquisition restrictions contained in our certificate of incorporation, which are intended to help preserve our net operating losses, may not be effective or may have unintended negative effects.\u201d\nOur stock price has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future; this volatility may affect the price at which you could sell our Class A common stock.\nThe trading price of the Class A common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on an investment in the Class A common stock:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u2022\nsuccess of competitors;\n\u2022\nour operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us, the market for digital and physical content, content distribution and entertainment in general;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nour ability to market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business or our industry;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022\nthe volume of shares of the Class A common stock available for public sale;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\nsales of substantial amounts of Class A common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of the Class A common stock irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general, and Nasdaq in particular, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of the Class A common stock, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies that investors perceive to be similar to us could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of the Class A common stock also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na restriction on certain acquisitions of our common stock to help preserve our ability to utilize our significant NOLs by avoiding the limitations imposed by Section 382 of the Code;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to determine to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that an annual meeting of stockholders may be called only by the board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nproviding that directors may be removed prior to the expiration of their terms by the Board of Directors only for cause.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of the Company or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the DGCL, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for the Class A common stock.\nWe have no present intention of paying dividends on our Class A common stock.\nWe have never paid any cash dividends on our Class A common stock and have no present plans to do so. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our Class A common stock unless you sell the shares for a price greater than that which you paid for them", "PERMNO": 89889, "SIC": 7822, "TIC": "CIDM"}
