{"cik": "1076481", "company": "SEQUENOM INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nBefore deciding to invest in our company or deciding to maintain or increase your investment, you should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below and in our other filings are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose your investment.\nWe may not be able to continue to generate significant revenue from any of the tests we have commercialized including the MaterniT21 PLUS test or any test that we may develop in the future.\nOur business is substantially dependent on our ability to develop and launch and obtain reimbursement for our diagnostic tests, including the MaterniT21 PLUS test. We have committed significant research and development resources for the development and validation of tests and we have likewise invested significant research and development resources for its potential future diagnostic products. There is no guarantee that we will successfully maintain our current revenues or generate additional revenues or significant revenues from any of our testing services, including the MaterniT21 PLUS test, or any other testing services that we plan to launch in the future. We have launched testing services for prenatal fetal chromosomal abnormalities, CF carrier screening, noninvasive prenatal Rhesus D genotyping, and risk assessment of a patient with \u201cdry\u201d or early stage AMD progressing to \u201cwet\u201d or advanced choroidal neovascular disease within 2, 5, and 10 years. The MaterniT21 PLUS test, which was originally launched in October 2011, detects fetal chromosomal abnormalities. The VisibiliT test, launched in 2014 is a risk score assay for the detection of increased representation of chromosomes 21 and 18. If we, or our partners, are not able to continue to successfully market or sell noninvasive prenatal diagnostic tests or successfully market or sell other tests we may develop for any reason, including the failure to obtain significant reimbursement from payors, or failure to obtain or maintain any required regulatory approvals, we will not generate or maintain significant revenues from the sale of such tests or testing services. A number of factors could impact our ability to continue to sell noninvasive prenatal diagnostic tests or other tests we have developed or may develop in the future or generate significant revenues from the sale of such tests or testing services, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe availability of alternative and competing tests or products, such as those using targeted sequencing based or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based approaches for NIPT to detect fetal chromosomal aneuploidies, or other approaches that may have a lower cost of goods and/or be less expensive to perform compared to the MaterniT21 PLUS test or our other tests, and which in turn may result in lower prices offered by competitors;\n\u2022\ntechnological innovations or other advances in medicine that cause our technologies to be less competitive;\n\u2022\npricing pressures, lower prices offered by competitors, or changes in third-party payor, government payor or private insurer reimbursement policies including potential delays or refusals to pay and uncertainty related to changes in CPT codes and uncertainty regarding payor adoption of and reimbursement rates for new gene sequencing related CPT codes that took effect in January 2015;\n\u2022\npayors and/or patients may not pay for services;\n\u2022\npayors may seek to reduce the use of our services by ordering physicians;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain sufficient intellectual property rights in our products, including our ability to overturn the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California\u2019s order ruling our \u2018540 Patent to be invalid, and our ability to ultimately enforce the \u2018540 Patent in the future against competitors and obtain injunctive relief and/or monetary damages from competitors;\n\u2022\nparties infringing our intellectual property rights or operating outside our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe ability to implement and maintain controls and risk management measures as appropriate;\n\u2022\nreliance on Sequenom Laboratories, which is subject to routine governmental oversight and inspections for continued operation pursuant to CLIA to process tests ordered by physicians;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain adequate infrastructure to support the continued commercialization of the MaterniT21 PLUS test and other testing services, including establishing adequate laboratory space, information technology infrastructure, sample collection and tracking systems including the laboratory information management system, or LIMS, electronic ordering and reporting systems and other infrastructure and hiring adequate laboratory and other personnel;\n\u2022\ncompliance with federal, state and foreign regulations governing laboratory testing on human specimens;\n\u2022\nthe marketing and sale of research use only or other tests;\n\u2022\nthe accuracy rates of such tests, including rates of false negatives and/or false positives;\n\u2022\nconcerns regarding the safety and effectiveness or clinical validity of noninvasive prenatal or other tests;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment affecting health care and health care providers, including changes in laws regulating laboratory testing and any laws regulating prenatal testing;\n\u2022\nthe extent and success of our sales and marketing efforts and ability to drive continued adoption of our testing services, including the MaterniT21 PLUS test and the VisibiliT test;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which payors and health care providers may limit or deny the addition of new laboratory-developed test service providers to their programs;\n\u2022\ngeneral changes or developments in the market for women's and/or prenatal health diagnostics, or diagnostics in general;\n\u2022\nethical and legal issues concerning the appropriate use of the information resulting from noninvasive prenatal diagnostic tests or other tests;\n\u2022\nthe refusal by women to undergo such tests for moral, religious or other reasons, or based on perceptions about the safety or reliability of such tests;\n\u2022\nour ability to provide effective customer support; and\n\u2022\nour ability to license and protect our patented technologies and our other technologies.\nWe may not be able to collect all or any of the estimated range of $31 million to $34 million of amounts outstanding for tests completed which have not been recognized as revenue upon delivery of the test results.\nOur business is substantially dependent on our ability to obtain reimbursement for our LDTs, including the MaterniT21 PLUS test. Collections for services performed have been volatile, and we expect collections to continue to fluctuate depending upon the results of our efforts to collect payment from third party payors. As of December 31, 2014, amounts outstanding for tests completed, net of estimated write-downs and adjustments, which were not recognized as revenue upon delivery of the test result because our accrual revenue recognition criteria were not met and the amounts had not been collected, range from approximately $31 million to $34 million, depending upon the ultimate reimbursement received for these outstanding claims. A number of factors could impact our ability to collect payment on these outstanding claims and impact the amount and timing of any payments, and we cannot provide any assurance as to when, if ever, and to what extent these amounts may be collected. If we are unsuccessful in collecting such outstanding amounts, it will adversely affect our financial position.\nClaims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, companies have asserted, and may again assert, patent, copyright or other intellectual proprietary rights against our tests or tests using our technologies, and/or against our customers (licensees and commercial partners). These claims have resulted and may in the future result in lawsuits being brought against us and/or our customers, and could negatively affect demand for our tests, particularly the MaterniT21 PLUS test, and our ability to maintain existing, or enter into new, agreements with customers. We may not prevail in any lawsuits alleging patent infringement given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any of our tests, technologies or activities, in particular our tests (including the MaterniT21 PLUS test) from which we derive and expect to continue to derive almost all of our revenues, were found to infringe on another company's intellectual property rights, we could be subject to an injunction that would force the removal of such test from the market or we could be required to redesign such test, which could be costly. We could also be ordered to pay damages or other compensation, including punitive damages and attorneys' fees to such other company. A negative outcome in any such litigation could also severely disrupt the use of our technologies by our customers and licensees or their customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with our customers, our market share and our revenues. Even if we are ultimately successful in defending any intellectual property litigation, such litigation is expensive and time consuming to address, will divert our management's attention from our business and may harm our reputation.\nOur ability to compete in the market may decline if we lose some of our intellectual property rights, if patent rights that we rely on are invalidated, or if we are unable to obtain other intellectual property rights.\nOur success will depend on our ability to obtain, protect, and maintain the validity of patents on our technology, to protect our trade secrets, and to maintain our rights to licensed intellectual property or technologies. Such patent rights include U.S. Patent No. 6,258,540 pr the 540 Patent, currently ruled invalid by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and foreign equivalents, which we have purchased from Isis for noninvasive prenatal diagnostics and noninvasive prenatal gender determination testing. Such patent rights also include U.S. patents and patent applications, and their foreign equivalents, which we have rights to under the Pooled Patents Agreement with Illumina. Such patent rights also include U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications in-licensed from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, or CUHK, or in-licensed from other third-party entities.\nOur patent applications or those of our licensors may not result in the issuance of patents in the U.S. or other countries. Our patents or those of our licensors may not afford meaningful protection for our technology and products. While we do not believe that the District Court\u2019s order ruling that the \u2018540 Patent is invalid will impact the competitive landscape (as we have been competing in the marketplace without the benefit of the patent being recognized by competitors), if we are unable to overturn that ruling, it will impact our potential ability in the future to obtain injunctive relief against competitors and/or money damages from competitors. Others may challenge our patents or those of our licensors by proceedings such as interference, oppositions, inter partes review, and reexaminations or in litigation seeking to establish the invalidity of our patents. In the event that one or more of our patents are challenged, the USPTO or a court may invalidate the patent(s) or determine that the patent(s) is not enforceable, which could harm our competitive position. If one or more of our patents are invalidated or found to be unenforceable, or if the scope of the claims in any of these patents is limited by the USPTO or a court decision, we could lose certain market exclusivity afforded by patents owned or in-licensed by us and potential competitors could more easily bring tests or products to the market that directly compete with our own, including the MaterniT21 PLUS test. Such adverse decisions may negatively impact our revenues. See Item 3 of this Report for a discussion of legal proceedings affecting our patents and patent applications.\nCompetitors may develop products or tests similar to ours that do not conflict with our patents or patent rights. Others may develop products, technologies or methods, including noninvasive prenatal tests or other diagnostic tests in violation of our patents or those of our licensors, or by operating around our patents or license agreements, which could reduce or remove our noninvasive prenatal and other diagnostic commercialization opportunities. To protect or enforce our patent rights, we have initiated interference and inter partes review proceedings, and we may initiate oppositions, reexaminations, or litigation against others. However, these activities are expensive, take significant time and divert management's attention from other business concerns. We may not prevail in these activities. If we are not successful in these activities, the prevailing party may obtain superior rights to our claimed inventions and technology, which could adversely affect our ability to successfully market and commercialize any of our tests that are dependent upon such technologies, including the MaterniT21 PLUS test. The patent position of biotechnology companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions that are often the subject of litigation. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court decided the case Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, 133 S. Ct. 2107 (2013) (No. 12-398), a case that held that, \u201cA naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated, but cDNA is patent eligible because it is not naturally occurring.\u201d This Supreme Court decision, and other Supreme Court and lower Federal Court decisions interpreting and/or limiting the scope of patentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101, as well as the new examination guidelines from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued in 2014 (i.e., the 2014 Interim Guidance on Patent Subject Matter Eligibility (Interim Eligibility Guidance) for USPTO personnel to use when determining subject matter eligibility under 35 U.S.C. 101 in view of recent decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court), have made it more difficult for patentees to obtain and/or maintain patent claims in the United States that are directed to biotechnology-related subject matter, as claims to that subject matter are often perceived to recite or involve Laws of Nature/Natural Principles, Natural Phenomena, and/or Natural Products. No consistent policy has emerged from the USPTO, the offices of foreign countries or the courts regarding the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection afforded under biotechnology patents. There is a substantial backlog of biotechnology patent applications at the USPTO and of the equivalent offices around the world and the approval or rejection of patent applications may take several years.\nIf we breach any of the terms of our license or supply agreements, or these agreements are otherwise terminated or modified, the termination or modification of such agreements could result in our loss of access to critical components and could delay or suspend our commercialization efforts, and we may compete with our suppliers which may adversely affect our business.\nWe have sourced or licensed components of our technology from other parties. Our failure to maintain continued supply of such components, particularly in the case of sole suppliers, or the right to use these components would seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In the event of any adverse developments with these vendors, Sequenom Laboratories\u2019 testing services may be interrupted, which would have an adverse impact on our business. Changes to\nor termination of our agreements or inability to renew our agreements with these parties or enter into new agreements with other suppliers could result in the loss of access to these aspects of our technology or other intellectual property rights or technologies that we may acquire from time to time and could impair, delay, or suspend our commercialization efforts, including efforts to market and commercialize the MaterniT21 PLUS test. While we negotiate for agreement periods or notice of termination periods that provide us reasonable periods of time to secure alternative supplies, and require that such agreements may not be terminated without advance notice arbitrarily or without good reason, such as uncured breach or insolvency, these negotiations are often unsuccessful or such provisions may not provide us with adequate time to secure alternative supplies, provide us with access to alternative technologies on commercially acceptable terms, or otherwise provide us with adequate protection.\nFor example, Illumina, is the sole supplier of sequencers and certain consumables for Sequenom Laboratories' MaterniT21 PLUS test. The supply of sequencers and consumables to Sequenom Laboratories is provided under the Supply Agreement, pursuant to which we and our affiliates will purchase various products from Illumina, which we and they will be able to use for NIPT as well as for other clinical and research uses. The Supply Agreement has a term of five years. Upon the expiration of the Supply Agreement, we face risk and uncertainty regarding our ability to renew the supply agreement or to enter into a new supply agreement with Illumina, if at all, and on financial terms that are acceptable to us. Our failure to maintain continued supply of such sequencers and consumables would seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe depend on third-party products and services and limited sources of supply to develop and perform its tests.\nWe rely on outside vendors to supply certain products, components and materials used in our test services. Illumina is the sole supplier of sequencers and certain consumables for the MaterniT21 PLUS and the VisibiliT test and those products have lead times of several months. Among other risks, using a platform provided by another party presents potential manufacturing supply and reliability, quality compliance, and intellectual property infringement risks. For example, we have no control over the manufacture of the Illumina sequencers and consumables that we are using for the MaterniT21 PLUS and the VisibiliT test, including whether such sequencers and consumables will meet their quality control requirements to ensure quality and reliability for the sequencers and consumables, and can give no assurance that we will be able to obtain a reliable supply of the sequencers and consumables that we need for our tests. In the event that demand for our tests declines or does not meet our forecasts, we could have excess inventory or increased expenses or our margins could decrease which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and business.\nMany other products, components and materials, including blood collection tubes for the MaterniT21 PLUS and the VisibiliT test and components of the MassARRAY System that is currently used for the CF carrier screen, fetal Rhesus D genotyping test and RetnaGene AMD test, are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers and some also have lead-times of several months.\nThese suppliers may be subject to regulation by the FDA and would therefore need to comply with federal regulations related to the manufacture and distribution of regulated products. Because we cannot ensure the actual production or manufacture of such critical equipment and materials, or the ability of our suppliers to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, we may be subject to significant delays caused by interruption in production or manufacturing.\nIn the event of any adverse developments with these suppliers or vendors, our test supply may be interrupted and obtaining substitute components could be difficult or require us to re-design our tests which would have an adverse impact on our business.\nCertain of our LDTs, including the MaterniT21 PLUS test, may not be eligible for reimbursement by payors or may become ineligible for reimbursement, or reimbursement may be significantly delayed, due to changes in CPT codes, or otherwise, which may limit the demand for these tests by physicians and their patients.\nCertain of our current LDTs, or future tests which we intend to launch as a testing service, may not be deemed medically necessary or may otherwise not be subject to reimbursement by payors, which could affect demand for such tests by physicians.\nCMS, a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), establishes reimbursement payment levels and coverage rules for Medicare. State Medicaid plans and third-party payors establish rates and coverage rules independently. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that requires us to provide scientific and clinical validity for the use of our tests to each payor separately, with no assurance that approval will be obtained. If CMS or other third-party payors decide not to cover our tests, place significant restrictions on the use of our tests, or offer inadequate payment amounts, our ability to generate revenues from our tests could be limited.\nEven a payor that covers our tests may reduce utilization or stop or lower reimbursement at any time, which could reduce our revenues. We are currently considered a \u201cnon-contracting provider\u201d by many third-party payors because we have not entered into a specific contract to provide our specialized testing services to their insured patients at specified rates of reimbursement. Without such contracts, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for our tests at acceptable rates, which\ncould also reduce our revenues. In cases where we have contracts in place, some payors continue to challenge the medical necessity of certain of our tests or have other objections that result in delay or non-payment to us.\nReimbursement for diagnostic tests furnished to Medicare beneficiaries generally is made based on a fee schedule set by CMS using a statutory formula. In recent years, payments under these fee schedules have decreased and may decrease more. In addition, Medicare fee schedules are impacted by the billing codes selected for reporting services, and changes to certain laboratory billing codes for diagnostic tests are being considered which may affect payment levels. We cannot predict whether or when additional third-party payors will cover our tests or offer adequate reimbursement to make them commercially attractive or whether existing payors will reduce utilization or stop or lower reimbursement. Clinicians or patients may decide not to order our tests if third-party reimbursement is inadequate, especially if ordering the test could result in financial liability for the patient, and reduced or discontinued purchases of our products would cause our revenues to decline.\nLevels of reimbursement may continue to decrease in the future, and future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors may harm the demand for and reimbursement available for our products, which in turn, could harm pricing and sales. The payment amounts under the Medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule are important not only for our reimbursement under Medicare, but also because the schedule often establishes the payment amounts set by other third-party payors. For example, state Medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more than the Medicare fee schedule limit for clinical laboratory services furnished to Medicaid recipients. As a result, in light of reductions in the clinical laboratory fee schedule, certain third-party payors may also reduce reimbursement amounts.\nIn the U.S. the AMA generally assigns specific billing codes for laboratory tests under a coding system known as Current Procedure Terminology, or CPT, codes, which are necessary for us, and our customers, to bill and receive reimbursement for our diagnostic tests. Once the CPT code is established, CMS in turn establishes payment levels and coverage rules under Medicare, and private payors establish rates and coverage rules independently. We cannot guarantee that any of our tests are or will be covered by the CPT codes that we believe may be applied to them or that any of our tests or other products will be approved for coverage or reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid or any third-party payor. Our tests and the CPT codes we use may not qualify for Medicaid reimbursement in any or all of the 50 states.\nIn addition, payors have initiated efforts to develop a more specific set of billing codes for laboratory tests so that the particular laboratory test is more precisely identified. CMS has established a new molecular diagnostic code for next generation sequencing tests specific for fetal aneuploidy, code 81420, was implemented on January 1, 2015. We cannot guarantee that this new code will help facilitate the reimbursement process or reduce the time required for third-party payors to process claims. When CMS recommends new codes typically the gap fill process is used in establishing a new code rate; however we cannot guarantee that such process will be used. These coding changes and lack of a CMS fee schedule have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our product pricing and the amount of and timing of payor reimbursement. We cannot guarantee that the issuance of the new code will improve our product pricing or the amount of and timing of payor reimbursement.\nUnder the Pooled Patents Agreement, if Illumina is not able to license additional laboratories, collect test fees or develop in-vitro diagnostic kits for NIPT, our revenues, net earnings, cash flow and profitability could be negatively affected.\nUnder the Pooled Patents Agreement, Illumina has exclusive worldwide rights to license the pooled patent rights to third-party laboratories to develop and sell their own laboratory-developed NIPT tests. We, Illumina and our respective licensees will pay a per-test fee into the pool for laboratory-developed NIPT tests, which will be shared between Illumina and us. We cannot guarantee that Illumina will be successful in licensing the pooled intellectual property to additional third-party laboratories and generating additional test fees. Also, we have no control over how many laboratory-developed NIPT tests Illumina will sell or over Illumina\u2019s collection of test fees from its licensees. To the extent Illumina is unsuccessful in selling its own laboratory-developed NIPT tests, obtaining additional third-party licensees under the pooled patent rights and/or collecting a test fee from such licensees, our revenues, net income, cash flow and profitability could be negatively affected.\nIn addition, under the Pooled Patents Agreement, Illumina has exclusive worldwide rights under the pooled patent rights to develop and sell in-vitro diagnostic kits for NIPT and to license others to do so. Illumina will pay royalties to us for sales of in-vitro diagnostic kits for NIPT by Illumina and such licensees. We have no control over when, if ever, Illumina will develop and sell in-vitro diagnostic kits for NIPT or license others to do so. If Illumina and its licensees fail to develop and sell in-vitro diagnostic kits for NIPT, we will not collect any royalties from Illumina which could negatively affect our revenues, net income, cash flow and profitability.\nUnder the Pooled Patents Agreement, if Illumina fails to effectively control prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of the pooled patent rights, the value of the pooled patent rights may be diminished and/or we may need to incur significant unexpected legal costs which may adversely impact our financial condition.\nUnder the Pooled Patents Agreement, Illumina will control prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of the pooled patent rights, and we will be responsible for paying a portion of the costs thereof. We have no control over these costs. We will continue to control, at our sole cost, the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of the patents we purchased from Isis including the \u2018540 patent. If Illumina fails to prosecute, maintain and/or enforce any of the pooled patent rights, the scope and value of the pooled patent rights may be diminished, and the revenues that we receive from our share of the test fees may be reduced. We have the right to assume control of the enforcement of certain of the pooled patent rights if Illumina fails to do so. If we do assume control of enforcement of any of the pooled patent rights, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts and the scope and value of the pooled patent rights may be diminished. In addition, our assumption of such control of enforcement of any of the pooled patent rights will cause us to incur significant unexpected legal costs which may adversely impact our financial condition.\nThe minimum payments we expect to receive under the Pooled Patents Agreement may be reduced which could negatively impact our cash flow and profitability.\nUnder the Pooled Patents Agreement, we are entitled to receive certain minimum annual payments from Illumina. In certain circumstances, the amount of these minimum payments may be reduced. These circumstances include a reduction in the average amount of the test fees collected, Illumina\u2019s enforcement of the pooled patents and the impairment or diminution in value of the pooled patent rights. We have no control over these circumstances and, should such circumstances occur, it could have a negative impact on our cash flow and profitability.\nOur failure to establish enrollment in and obtain favorable payment policies from state Medicaid programs could result in a substantial portion of our services being unreimbursed and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have established enrollment in many state Medicaid programs. However, even though we are enrolled in many state Medicaid programs, we are not receiving reimbursement or are receiving lower than expected reimbursement in most of those states. In mid-2013 it became apparent that most states still did not have appropriate procedure codes incorporated into their payment system for reimbursement for molecular tests, and we initiated efforts to reduce the volume of Medicaid tests from those states. At the same time, we increased our efforts to put reimbursement pathways in place with each state, and work with the AMA to get a specific CPT code for the MaterniT21 PLUS test. CMS has established a new molecular diagnostic code for next generation sequencing tests specific for fetal aneuploidy, code 81420, which was implemented on January 1, 2015, however it is not exclusive to the MaterniT21 PLUS test. In those states where we are not enrolled in the Medicaid system, we do not receive reimbursement for our tests. If we are unable to receive reimbursement, or adequate reimbursements under state Medicaid programs, our opportunity for future revenues would be reduced, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nBilling complexities associated with obtaining payment or reimbursement for our tests may negatively affect our revenues, cash flow and profitability. We may incur additional financial risk related to collections and reimbursement in connection with the commercialization of our molecular diagnostic tests.\nBilling for clinical laboratory testing services is complex. We generally bills third-party payors for our testing services and pursues case-by-case reimbursement where policies are not in place for a particular test. We may also face an increased risk in our collection efforts, including potential write-offs of doubtful accounts and long collection cycles for accounts receivable related to our testing service, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We began internal billing operations on May 1, 2013. Among the factors complicating our billing of third-party payors are:\n\u2022\ndisputes among payors as to which party is responsible for payment;\n\u2022\ndisparity in coverage among various payors;\n\u2022\ndisparity in information and billing requirements among payors; and\n\u2022\nincorrect or missing billing information, which is required to be provided by the prescribing physician.\nThese billing complexities, and the related uncertainty in obtaining payment for our tests, could negatively affect our revenues, cash flow and profitability.\nOur failure to comply with governmental payor regulations could result in our being excluded from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental payor programs, which would decrease our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Medicare program is administered by CMS, which, like the states that administer their respective state Medicaid programs, imposes extensive and detailed requirements on diagnostic services providers, including, but not limited to, rules that govern how we structure our relationships with physicians, how and when we submit reimbursement claims and how we provide our specialized diagnostic services. Our failure to comply with applicable Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental payor rules could result in our inability to participate in a governmental payor program, our returning funds already paid to us,\ncivil monetary penalties, criminal penalties and/or limitations on the operational function of our laboratory. If we were unable to receive reimbursement under a governmental payor program, a substantial portion of our revenues would be lost, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nContinued evolution of the U.S. health care reform law could adversely affect our business, profitability and stock price and prevent the commercial success of the MaterniT21 PLUS test.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA. At this time, it remains unclear whether there will be any further changes made to PPACA, whether in part or in its entirety.\nThe PPACA includes expansions of health care fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance. As discussed below, enforcement of any of these laws against our company could harm our business.\nIt is unclear whether and to what extent, if at all, other anticipated developments resulting from health care reform, such as an increase in the number of people with health insurance and an increased focus on preventive medicine, may provide us additional revenue. Extending coverage to a large population could substantially change the structure of the health insurance system and the methodology for reimbursing medical services, drugs and devices. These structural changes could entail modifications to the existing system of third-party payors and government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, the creation of additional government-sponsored health care insurance sources, or some combination of both, as well as other changes. Restructuring the coverage of medical care in the U.S. could impact the reimbursement for diagnostic tests like ours, including the MaterniT21 PLUS test. If reimbursement for our diagnostic tests is substantially less than we or our clinical laboratory customers expect, or rebate obligations associated with them are substantially increased, our business could be materially and adversely impacted.\nAny health care reform measures adopted by the U.S. government and other governments could cause significant pressure on the pricing of health care products and services, including the MaterniT21 PLUS test, in the U.S. and internationally, as well as the amount of reimbursement available from governmental agencies or other third-party payors. The continuing efforts of the U.S. and foreign governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors to contain or reduce health care costs may compromise our ability to set prices at commercially attractive levels for our tests, including the MaterniT21 PLUS test, and other diagnostic tests that we may develop. Changes in health care policy, such as the creation of broad limits for diagnostic products, could substantially diminish the sale of or inhibit the utilization of future diagnostic tests, increase costs, divert management's attention and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability.\nNew laws, regulations and judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations and decisions, relating to health care availability, methods of delivery or payment for diagnostic products and services, or sales, marketing or pricing, may also limit our potential revenues, and we may need to revise our research and development or commercialization programs. The pricing and reimbursement environment may change in the future and become more challenging for a number of reasons, including policies advanced by the U.S. government, new health care legislation or fiscal challenges faced by government health administration authorities. Specifically, in both the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals and initiatives to change the health care system in ways that could affect our and Sequenom Laboratories' ability to sell our diagnostic tests, including the MaterniT21 PLUS test, profitably. Some of these proposed and implemented reforms could result in reduced utilization or reimbursement rates for our diagnostic products.\nIf our laboratory facilities are damaged, our business would be seriously harmed.\nWe operate laboratory facilities in San Diego, California, Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina. Damage to our facilities due to war, fire, natural disaster, earthquake, power loss, communications failure, terrorism, unauthorized entry, or other events could prevent us from conducting our business for an indefinite period, could result in a loss of important data or cause us to cease development and processing of our test services. We cannot be certain that our limited insurance to protect against business interruption would be adequate or would continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe must comply with stringent CLIA requirements to operate, and have limited capacity and infrastructure. Our ability to successfully develop and commercialize tests and to generate revenues will depend on our ability to successfully operate our CLIA-certified laboratory, establish and maintain necessary capacity, and maintain required regulatory licensures.\nSequenom Laboratories, a CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited laboratory, has developed, validated and commercialized five laboratory-developed tests to date. For future tests, if we are unable to successfully develop and validate any new tests that we intend to commercialize we may not be able to successfully commercialize such tests on the anticipated timelines or at all. Although we have invested substantially in our infrastructure, and believe that we have sufficient infrastructure and capacity for near-term demand, it is possible that we may not have adequate infrastructure and capacity in place to meet longer term future demand for our currently launched testing services or for the demand of future tests that we develop. Our ability to successfully\ndevelop and validate tests will depend on our ability to successfully operate and maintain required regulatory licensure and we cannot provide assurances that we will have sufficient resources to continue our operations and maintain our licenses. We currently perform the MaterniT21 PLUS test in our San Diego, California, and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, facilities. We face risk in relying upon two laboratory locations to meet demand for, perform, and generate revenues from the MaterniT21 PLUS test. Reliance upon two facilities presents risk to our operations in the event that one or both facilities' capacity is exceeded, or one or both facilities experiences production problems or delays.\nCLIA requirements are designed to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. Potential sanctions for failure to comply with CLIA requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory's CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. Laboratories must undergo on-site surveys at least every two years, which may be conducted by the Federal CLIA program or by a private CMS approved accrediting agency, such as CAP, among others. Sequenom Laboratories is also subject to regulation of laboratory operations under state clinical laboratory laws as will be any new CLIA-certified laboratory that we establish or acquire. State clinical laboratory laws may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records. Certain states, such as California, Florida, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, require that laboratories obtain licenses to test specimens from patients residing in those states and additional states may require similar licenses in the future. If we are unable to obtain and maintain licenses from states where required, it will not be able to process any samples from patients located in those states. Only Washington and New York States are exempt under CLIA, as these states have established laboratory quality standards at least as stringent as the CLIA requirement's. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain compliance with the CLIA requirements, CMS or state agencies could require us to cease our testing services, including the MaterniT21 PLUS test. Even if it were possible for us to bring our laboratory back into compliance after failure to comply with such requirements, we could incur significant expenses and potentially lose revenues in doing so.\nFailure to establish, and perform to, appropriate quality standards to assure that the highest level of quality is observed in the performance of our testing services could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation.\nThe provision of clinical testing services, including the MaterniT21 PLUS test, and related services, and the marketing of those services involve certain inherent risks. The services that we provide and markets are intended to provide information for health care providers in providing patient care. Therefore, users of such services may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services that are intended for other purposes, such as research.\nPerformance defects, incomplete process controls, unexpected failure modes, unanticipated use of Sequenom Laboratories' services, or inadequate disclosure of information (including associated risks or limitations) relating to the use of the services can lead to injury or other adverse events, including laboratory operation disruptions, delays, or incorrect clinical testing results. These events could lead to safety alerts relating to our services (either voluntary or required by governmental authorities) and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of services from the market. Any removal of services could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity that could reduce demand for our test services. Personal injuries relating to the use of our services can also result in product liability claims being brought against us.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nOur revenues and results of operations may fluctuate significantly, depending on a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nour success in developing, marketing, and selling, and changes in demand for our diagnostic testing services, including the MaterniT21 PLUS test, and the level of reimbursement and collection obtained for these tests;\n\u2022\nthe pricing of our diagnostic testing services, and the timing and pricing of new diagnostic testing service offerings, and those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage costs and expenses and effectively implement our business strategy;\n\u2022\nour ability, if necessary, to raise additional capital;\n\u2022\nthe amount of royalties that we are required to pay to third parties in connection with the sale of certain of our testing services;\n\u2022\nour success in collecting payments from third-party payors, customers, and collaborative partners, variations in the timing of these payments and the recognition of these payments as revenues;\n\u2022\nour success in responding to customer complaints effectively and managing relationships with our customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to identify and develop in a cost-efficient manner new services, such as noninvasive prenatal and other diagnostic technologies, our ability to improve current services to increase demand for such services and the success of such products and improvements;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain sufficient intellectual property rights including our ability to overturn the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California\u2019s order ruling the \u2018540 Patent to be invalid, and our ability to ultimately enforce the 540 Patent in the future against competitors and obtain injunctive relief and/or monetary damages from competitors;\n\u2022\nthe potential need to acquire licenses to new technology, including genetic markers that may be useful in diagnostic applications, or to use our technology in new markets, which could require us to pay unanticipated license fees and royalties in connection with licenses we may need to acquire;\n\u2022\nour research and development progress, including our ability to develop and validate improved or new tests, , particularly in our expanded field of oncology, and how rapidly we are able to achieve technical milestones;\n\u2022\nthe cost, quality and availability of the hardware platforms and consumables, including reagents and related components and technologies, used by us to perform our tests;\n\u2022\nmaterial developments in our customer and supplier relationships, including our ability to successfully transition to new technologies and/or alternative suppliers; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of any legal expenses, settlement payments, fines or damages arising from patent litigation or any future litigation.\nThe absence of or delay in reimbursement for our testing services and generating revenues has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our operating results from period to period and will result in increased operating losses unless and until such reimbursement is established, at sufficient levels to cover our costs. Our internationally derived revenues and operating results are also difficult to predict because they depend upon the activities of our licensees in numerous countries.\nWe believe that period-to-period comparisons of our financial results will not necessarily be meaningful. You should not rely on these comparisons as an indication of our future performance. If our operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, our stock price may decline.\nOur increased leverage as a result of our issuance of the 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2017 may harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur total consolidated long-term debt and obligations as of December 31, 2014, which includes the 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2017, or Convertible Senior Notes, was $139.7 million and represented approximately 129% of our total capitalization as of that date.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences on our future operations, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under the Convertible Senior Notes and our other outstanding debt;\n\u2022\nresulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, which could result in all of our indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u2022\nreducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industries in which we operate and the general economy;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged and that, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our debt levels or leverage prevent us from exploiting; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing.\nEach of these factors may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the Convertible Senior Notes and our other indebtedness.\nWe may not be able to generate enough cash flow from our operations to service our indebtedness.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. In September 2012, we completed the sale of $130.0 million of our Convertible Senior Notes. Our ability to make payments on, and to refinance, our indebtedness, including the Convertible Senior Notes, and to fund planned commercialization efforts, research and development efforts, working capital and other general corporate purposes depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Historically, our business has generated losses and we may never become profitable. If we are unable to generate the necessary cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring indebtedness or\nobtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. If we raise additional debt, it will increase our interest expense, our leverage and our operating and financial costs. In addition, the terms of the indenture governing the Convertible Senior Notes restricts our ability to incur additional debt, and the agreements governing our other existing or future indebtedness may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives. We may not be able to execute any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe Convertible Senior Notes also include a provision whereby upon a \u201cfundamental change\u201d, which is defined in the indenture related to the Convertible Senior Notes, holders of the Convertible Senior Notes may require us to repurchase, for cash, all or a portion of their Convertible Senior Notes. We may not have sufficient funds to pay the interest or repurchase price when due. In addition, the terms of any borrowing agreements which we may enter into from time to time may require early repayment of borrowings under circumstances similar to those constituting a \u201cfundamental change\u201d. These agreements may also make our repurchase of Convertible Senior Notes an event of default under the agreements.\nIf we fail to make any required payments under our indebtedness, or otherwise breach the terms of our indebtedness, including the Convertible Senior Notes, all or a substantial portion of our indebtedness could be subject to acceleration. In such a situation, it is unlikely we would be able to repay the accelerated debt, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to generate enough cash flow from our operations or otherwise obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, our financial results, financial condition and our ability to continue as a going concern will be adversely affected and we will have to cease or reduce further commercialization efforts or delay or terminate some or all of our diagnostic testing services or other product development programs.\nWe expect to continue to incur losses and may have to raise additional cash to fund our planned operations.\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and current marketable securities were $93.9 million as of December 31, 2014. Based on our current plans, we believe our cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities and collections from our commercialized testing services and income from the Pooled Patents Agreement will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements through the next twelve months. We are continuing to expand our operations following commercialization of the MaterniT21 PLUS test and our research and development activities related to improvements to current tests and expansion of our test menu, particularly in our expanded field of oncology, may require raising additional funds. In addition, there can be no assurances that these commercialization or research and development activities will be successful. We cannot be certain that our efforts to obtain reimbursement for our tests will be successful. Our current sales and marketing operations may not be sufficient to maintain or increase the level of market awareness and sales required for us to retain significant commercial success for the MaterniT21 PLUS test. If we are not able to successfully implement our marketing, sales commercialization, and reimbursement strategies, we may not be able to expand geographically, increase sales of the MaterniT21 PLUS test or successfully commercialize any future tests or products that we may develop and therefore may not be able to generate revenues sufficient to fund operations. If we are not able to generate revenues sufficient to fund operations, we may need to raise additional funds through financing or other means. The actual amount of funds that we will need and the timing of any such investment will be determined by many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in the future to support expanding commercialization of the MaterniT21 PLUS test and continued development and commercialization of our proprietary technology, particularly in our expanded field of oncology. We may need to sell equity or debt securities to raise significant additional funds. However, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities.\nThe amount of additional funds we may need depends on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe degree to which our costs and expenses exceed our revenues;\n\u2022\nour success selling, marketing and generating revenues from the MaterniT21 PLUS test and the level of reimbursement and collections from third-party payors;\n\u2022\nour success in selling, marketing and generating revenues from our testing services for CF carrier screening, fetal Rhesus D genotyping, and AMD, and the level of reimbursement and collections from third-party payors for these and future tests;\n\u2022\nthe level of our selling, general, and administrative expenses;\n\u2022\nour obligation to pay royalties to third parties in connection with the sale of our tests;\n\u2022\nour success and the extent of our investment in the research, development and commercialization of diagnostic technology, including molecular diagnostics, noninvasive prenatal diagnostic technology, oncology and the acquisition and/or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nour success in obtaining sufficient quantities and quality of patient samples;\n\u2022\nour success in obtaining regulatory clearance or approval, if applicable, to market any of our testing services in various countries, including the U.S.;\n\u2022\nour success in validating additional laboratory-developed tests and the levels of clinical performance achieved;\n\u2022\nour success either alone or in collaboration with our partners in launching and selling additional diagnostic testing services, particularly in our expanded field of oncology;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we enter into, maintain, and derive revenues from licensing agreements, including agreements to out-license our noninvasive prenatal analysis technology, research and other collaborations, joint ventures and other business arrangements;\n\u2022\nthe level of our legal expenses and any damages or settlement payments arising from ongoing or new patent related litigation;\n\u2022\nthe amount of any legal expenses, settlement payments, fines or damages arising from any future litigation or demand and the extent to which any of the foregoing is not covered by insurance;\n\u2022\nthe dilution from any issuance of securities, whether in connection with future capital-raising or merger or acquisition transactions, the settlement of litigation, or otherwise;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire, and our success in integrating, technologies or companies;\n\u2022\ncompliance with corporate governance and regulatory developments or initiatives;\n\u2022\nregulatory changes by the FDA, CMS and other worldwide regulatory authorities; and\n\u2022\ntechnological developments in our markets.\nAdditional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms satisfactory to us or at all. General market conditions, the market price of our common stock, our financial condition, uncertainty about the successful commercialization and development of diagnostic tests, particularly in our expanded field of oncology, regulatory developments, the uncertainty regarding the results of ongoing litigation matters, the status and scope of our patent rights or other factors may not support capital raising transactions. In addition, our ability to raise additional capital may depend upon obtaining stockholder approval. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain stockholder approval if it is necessary. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funds on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, we may be required to cease or reduce further commercialization of our testing services, to cease or reduce certain research and development projects, to sell, license or otherwise dispose of some or all of our technology or assets, to merge all or a portion of our business with another entity or we may not be able to continue as a going concern. If we raise additional funds by selling shares of our capital stock (or otherwise issue shares of our capital stock or rights to acquire share of our capital stock), the ownership interest of our current stockholders will be diluted.\nThe development of new, more cost-effective tests that can be performed by our customers or by patients, or the internalization of testing by hospitals or physicians, could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues.\nAdvances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective tests that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory such as point-of-care tests that can be performed by physicians in their offices, esoteric tests that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories or home testing that can be performed by patients in their homes. Although CLIA compliance makes it cost prohibitive for many physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices, manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing point-of-care test equipment to physicians. Diagnostic tests cleared or approved by the FDA for home use are automatically deemed to be exempt under CLIA and may also be performed in physician office laboratories with minimal regulatory oversight under CLIA. Test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to both physicians and patients of test kits cleared or approved by the FDA for point-of-care testing or home use. Development of such technology and its use by our customers could reduce the demand for Sequenom Laboratories' testing services and negatively impact our revenues. Our future success will depend on our ability to keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers on a timely and cost-effective basis and to pursue new market opportunities that develop as a result of technological and scientific advances.\nQuarterly revenues may be difficult to predict.\nWe may be unable to accurately predict quarterly revenues relating to the MaterniT21 PLUS test and our other tests due to relatively recent changes in billing codes and adoption and implementation of billing codes by payors and uncertainties related to the PPACA. If our quarterly or year-end revenues fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, our stock price may decline.\nUncertainty regarding the development of new tests, including our plans to develop tests in the field of oncology, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are continuing to focus research and development efforts on tests, in addition to improvements and additions to current tests, including the MaterniT21 PLUS test. We will look to develop an oncology testing service based on our research and technology capabilities to be used initially for research and potential future clinical studies. Our plans for 2015 are to continue\nto research, develop and commercialize tests for prenatal genetic disorders and diseases, women's health-related disorders and diseases, and for oncology. The launch of any other test will require the completion of certain clinical development and commercialization activities, and may include the efforts of collaborative partners on which we sometimes rely, and the expenditure of additional cash resources. We can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete the clinical development of any other test or diagnostic test or that we will be able to establish or maintain the collaborative relationships (if any collaborators are involved) that are essential to our clinical development and commercialization efforts. We have limited experience in the field of oncology and we cannot guarantee that our research and development activities will be successful in developing any marketable oncology testing service. We also can give no assurance that we will be able to reduce our expenditures sufficiently or otherwise mitigate the risks associated with our business to raise enough capital to complete clinical development or commercialization activities. Clinical development requires large numbers of patient specimens and we may not be able to use prior collected specimens or collect a sufficient number of appropriate specimens in a timely manner in the future to complete clinical development for any planned test. Patient specimens for clinical development for noninvasive prenatal tests may be unavailable or available only in limited quantities due to an increased number of competitive parties seeking such specimens. Also, as noninvasive testing increases in demand and invasive testing (such as amniocentesis) potentially declines over time, less patient specimens for clinical development become available that include confirmatory data from an invasive procedure such as amniocentesis. Failure to possess or to collect a sufficient number of appropriate specimens in a timely manner could prevent or significantly delay our ability to research, develop, complete clinical development and validation, obtain FDA clearance or approval as may be necessary, or launch any of our planned tests. Any failure to complete on-going clinical studies for our planned tests could have material adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe may not successfully obtain, or maintain, regulatory approval of any noninvasive prenatal or other product which we or our licensing or collaborative partners develop.\nProducts we or our collaborators develop in the noninvasive prenatal diagnostic or other markets depending on their intended use, may be regulated as medical devices by the FDA and other worldwide regulatory authorities. In the U.S., our tests may require either a Premarket 510(k) Notification or a Premarket Approval Application to be submitted to the U.S. FDA prior to marketing in interstate commerce. The Premarket 510(k) Notification process usually takes from three to nine months from submission to clearance, but can take significantly longer. The PMA approval process is much more costly, lengthy, uncertain and generally takes from nine to eighteen months or longer from submission to approval. In addition, commercialization of any diagnostic or other product that we or our licensees or collaborators develop would depend upon successful completion of non-clinical (bench) testing and clinical studies. Non-clinical bench testing and clinical studies can be long, expensive, and uncertain processes and we do not know whether we, our licensees, or any of our collaborators, would be permitted or able to undertake clinical studies of any potential products. It may take us or our licensees or collaborators many years to complete any such testing, and failure could occur at any stage. Results from preliminary studies do not necessarily predict final results, and acceptable results in early studies may not be repeated in later studies. A number of companies in the diagnostics industry, including biotechnology companies, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical studies, even after promising results in earlier studies. Delays or rejections of potential products may be encountered based on changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review. If our projects reach clinical studies, we or our licensees or collaborators could decide to discontinue development of any or all of these projects at any time for commercial, scientific, or other reasons.\nThe FDA currently regulates IVD devices under the authority of Section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. To date, the FDA has exercised its regulatory enforcement discretion to not regulate LDTs as a medical device and exempted from regulation LDTs created and used within a single laboratory. However, at a July 2010 FDA public meeting on oversight of tests, the FDA stated that it was reconsidering its enforcement discretion policy. The FDA commented that regulation of LDTs may be warranted because of the growth in the volume and complexity of testing services utilizing LDTs. On July 31, 2014 the FDA notified the U.S. Congress of its intent to issue draft guidance on regulation of LDTs based on risk to patients rather than whether they were made by a conventional manufacturer or a single laboratory. This draft guidance includes pre-market review for higher-risk LDTs, like those used to guide treatment decisions, including companion diagnostics that have entered the market as LDTs. In addition, under the draft guidance, the FDA would continue to exercise enforcement discretion for LDTs used solely for forensic purposes and LDTs used in CLIA-certified high complexity histocompatibaility labs for transplantation, among others. The final regulation would be phased in over many years. On September 30, 2014, the FDA posted on its website draft guidance on regulation of LDTs, maintaining a \u2018risk-based\u2019 approach outlined in its notice to U.S. Congress on July 31, 2014. The published draft guidance is identical to the congressional notification. On October 3, 2014, the FDA published notices in the Federal Register formally announcing the release of the draft guidance and the beginning of a 120-day public comment period, with final guidance potentially issued in the March-April 2015 timeframes. Our revenues from testing services utilizing LDTs comprise almost 100% of our total revenues.\nIn addition to the potential regulation of LDTs by FDA as mentioned above, certification of the laboratory is required under CLIA to ensure the accuracy and reliability of all laboratory testing, except research, on human specimens through a quality assurance program, which includes standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management and quality control procedures. In addition, state laboratory licensing and inspection requirements may also apply.\nWe cannot predict the extent of the FDA's final guidance on regulation of LDTs in general or with respect to our LDTs in particular. If we are unable to comply with the FDA's final guidance on regulation of LDTs, we may have to cease our testing services which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, if we are unable to successfully launch any additional LDTs or if we are otherwise required to obtain FDA premarket clearance or approval prior to commercializing any of our products or are not able to comply with any other regulatory requirements that the FDA may impose on LDTs, our ability to generate revenues from providing such products may be delayed and we may never be able to generate significant revenues from providing diagnostic products.\nThe results of preclinical and clinical studies are not necessarily predictive of future results, and our current diagnostic tests and product candidates may not have favorable results in later studies.\nWe intend to publish results of certain of our studies, and have published studies of our tests, and there can be no assurance that such results when published will be viewed favorably by clinicians, patients or investors. In addition, our scientific collaborators and other third parties may also publish results relating to their own studies. There can be no assurance that the results of their studies when published will be viewed favorably. If such results are not viewed favorably after publication, it could have a negative impact on the perception of our technology and its tests.\nPerformance achieved in published studies may not be repeated in later studies that may be required to obtain either FDA premarket clearance or approval. Limited results from earlier-stage verification studies may not predict results from studies in larger numbers of subjects drawn from more diverse populations over a longer period of time. Unfavorable results from ongoing preclinical and clinical studies could result in delays, modifications or abandonment of ongoing or future clinical studies, or abandonment of a product development program or may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals or commercialization.\nWe and our licensees and collaborators may not be successful in developing or commercializing diagnostic products or tests, including noninvasive prenatal diagnostic products or tests, or other products or tests using technologies, services, or discoveries.\nDevelopment of products or tests by us, our licensees, or our collaborators are subject to risks of failure inherent in the development and commercial viability of any such product or test, such as demand for such product or test. These risks further include the possibility that such product or test would:\n\u2022\nbe found to be ineffective, unreliable, inadequate or otherwise fail to receive regulatory clearance or approval or be subject to new or additional regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nbe difficult or impossible to manufacture or perform on a commercial scale;\n\u2022\nbe uneconomical to market or otherwise not be effectively marketed;\n\u2022\nfail to be successfully commercialized if adequate reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations for the costs of such product is unavailable;\n\u2022\nbe impossible to commercialize because such product or test infringes on the proprietary rights of others or competes with products marketed by others that are superior;\n\u2022\nfail to be commercialized prior to the successful marketing of similar products or tests by competitors; or\n\u2022\nbe subject to competitive price erosion that makes it uneconomical to market effectively.\nIf a licensee discovers or develops diagnostic or other products or tests or we or a collaborator, discover or develop diagnostic or other products or tests using our technology, products, services, or discoveries, we may rely on that licensee or collaborator, referred to as partner, for product or test development, regulatory approval, manufacturing, and marketing of those products or tests before we can realize revenues and some or all of the milestone payments, royalties, or other payments we may be entitled to under the terms of the licensing or collaboration agreement. If we or our partners fail to develop successful products or tests, we will not earn the revenues contemplated and we could lose license rights to intellectual property that are required to commercialize such products or tests. Our agreements may allow our partners significant discretion in electing whether to pursue any of these activities. We cannot control the amount and timing of resources our partners may devote to our programs or potential products or tests. As a result, we cannot be certain that our partners will choose to develop or commercialize any products or tests or will be successful in doing so. In addition, if a partner is involved in a business combination, such as a merger or acquisition, or changes its business focus, its performance under its agreement with us may suffer and, as a result, we may not generate any revenues or only limited revenues from the royalty, milestone, and similar payment provisions contained in our agreement with that partner.\nWe may not be able to form and maintain the collaborative relationships or the rights to third-party intellectual property and technologies that our business strategy requires and such relationships may lead to disputes over technology rights or product revenue, royalties, or other payments.\nWe form research collaborations and licensing arrangements with collaborators to operate our business successfully. To succeed, we will have to maintain our existing relationships and establish additional collaborations and licensing arrangements. Our current strategy includes pursuing partnering opportunities with companies interested in or involved in the development of pharmaceutical and diagnostic products and tests. Our strategy also includes obtaining ownership of, or licenses to third-party intellectual property rights and technologies to potentially expand our product and testing portfolio and generate additional sources of revenue. Disputes may arise in connection with these collaborations and licensing arrangements, which may result in liability to us or may result in the loss of acquired technology that may adversely affect our business.\nWe cannot be sure that we will be able to establish any additional research collaborations, licensing arrangements, or other partnerships necessary to develop and commercialize products or that we can do so on terms favorable to us. If we are unable to establish these collaborations or licensing arrangements, we may not be able to successfully generate any milestone, royalty, or other revenues from sales of these products or applications. If our collaborations or licensing arrangements are not successful or we are not able to manage multiple collaborations successfully, our programs will suffer and we may never generate any revenues or only generate limited revenues from sales of products based on licensed rights or technologies or under these collaborative or licensing arrangements. If we increase the number of collaborations or licensing agreements, it will become more difficult to manage the various relationships successfully and the potential for conflicts among the collaborators and licensees or licensors will increase. Conflicts with our collaborators, licensees or licensors, or other factors may lead to disputes over technology or intellectual property rights or product revenue, royalties, or other payments, which may adversely affect our business, including our ability to generate revenues from the MaterniT21 PLUS test.\nIn addition, our government grants provide the government certain license rights to inventions resulting from funded work. Our business could be harmed if the government exercises those rights.\nThe agreements and rights we rely upon to protect the intellectual property underlying our tests and technology may not be adequate, which could enable others to use our technology and reduce our ability to compete with them.\nWe require our employees, consultants, advisors, and collaborators to execute confidentiality agreements and in certain cases, assignment or license agreements. We cannot guarantee that these agreements will provide us with adequate intellectual property ownership or protection against improper or unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information or inventions. In some situations, these agreements may conflict with or be subject to the rights of others with whom our employees, consultants, advisors, or collaborators have prior employment or consulting relationships. In some situations these types of agreements or relationships are subject to foreign law, which provides us with less favorable rights or treatment than under U.S. law. Others may gain access to our inventions, trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary materials, products, information, and techniques.\nOur business and industry are subject to complex and costly regulation and if government regulations are interpreted or enforced in a manner adverse to us, we may be subject to enforcement actions, penalties, exclusion, and other material limitations on our operations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the health care industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The definition of \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of free supplies, equipment or services, credit arrangements, payments of cash and waivers of payment. Several courts have interpreted the statute's intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal health care fraud statutes to provide that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.\nThe Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, Congress authorized the HHS Office of Inspector General, or OIG, to issue a series of regulations,\nknown as \u201csafe harbors.\u201d These safe harbors set forth requirements that, if met in their entirety, will assure health care providers and other parties that they most likely will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal, or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG. Penalties for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other healthcare programs. Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for health care items or services reimbursed by any payor, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and do not contain identical safe harbors. Government officials have brought cases against numerous companies and certain sales and marketing personnel for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business.\nIn addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute, we are also subject to the physician self-referral laws, commonly referred to as the Stark law, which generally prohibits physicians from referring Medicare patients to providers of \u201cdesignated health services,\u201d including clinical laboratories, with whom the physician or the physician's immediate family member has an ownership interest or compensation arrangement, unless an applicable exception applies. The Stark law is a strict liability statute, meaning that a violation may occur regardless of the parties' intent. Moreover, many states have adopted or are considering adopting similar laws, some of which extend beyond the scope of the Stark law to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the prohibited referral of patients for designated health care services and physician self-referrals, regardless of the source of the payment for the patient's care. Penalties for violations of the Stark law include denial of payment, refund of payment, imposition of up to $15,000 in civil monetary penalties for each claim submitted in violation of the law, up to $100,000 in civil monetary penalties for each \u201carrangement or scheme\u201d that violates the law, a civil monetary penalty of three times the amount claimed, and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program and/or other government health programs. If it is determined that certain of our practices or operations violate the Stark law or similar statutes, the imposition of any such penalties could harm our business.\nAnother development affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal civil False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act's \u201cwhistleblower\u201d or \u201cqui tam\u201d provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a federal health care program. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of $5,500 to $11,000 for each separate false claim. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of, among other things, inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, improper use of Medicare numbers when detailing the provider of services, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created several new federal crimes, including health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or under the federal crimes created by HIPAA, or the impact of such actions. However, the costs of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could significantly adversely affect our financial performance.\nFederal law prohibits any entity from offering or transferring to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration that the entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary's selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof) and transfers of items or services for free or for other than fair market value. Entities found in violation may be liable for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act. Although we believe that our sales and marketing practices are in material compliance with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations, relevant regulatory authorities may disagree, and violation of these laws or our exclusion from such programs as Medicaid and other governmental programs as a result of a violation of such laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nEthical, privacy, or other concerns about the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our products and services.\nGenetic testing has raised ethical issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information. For these reasons, governmental authorities may limit or otherwise regulate the use of genetic testing, including the MaterniT21 PLUS test, or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those that have no known cure. Such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permitted and may lead to negative public relations. Any of these scenarios could reduce the potential markets for our products and services, which would seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf the validity of an informed consent from a subject was to be challenged, we could be forced to stop using some of our resources, which would hinder our diagnostic product development efforts.\nWe have measures in place to ensure that all clinical data and genetic and other biological samples that we receive from our clinical collaborators have been collected from subjects who have provided appropriate informed consent for the data and samples provided for purposes which extend to include commercial diagnostic product and test development activities. We have measures in place to ensure that data and samples that have been collected by our clinical collaborators are provided to us on a subject de-identified manner. We also have measures in place to ensure that the subjects from whom our data and samples are collected do not retain or have conferred on them any proprietary or commercial rights to the data or any discoveries derived from them. Our clinical collaborators are based in a number of different countries, and, to a large extent, we rely upon our clinical collaborators for appropriate compliance with the subject's informed consent provided and with local law and international regulation. That our data and samples come from and are collected by entities based in different countries results in complex legal questions regarding the adequacy of informed consent and the status of genetic material under a large number of different legal systems. The subject's informed consent obtained in any particular country could be challenged in the future, and those informed consents could prove invalid, unlawful or otherwise inadequate for our purposes. Any findings against us, or our clinical collaborators, could deny us access to or force us to stop using some of our clinical samples, which would hinder our diagnostic product and test development efforts. We could become involved in legal challenges, which could consume our management and financial resources.\nIf we cannot obtain licenses to patented genetic markers and genes relevant to our diagnostic areas of interest, we could be prevented from obtaining significant revenues or becoming profitable.\nThe USPTO has issued patents claiming single SNP and gene discoveries and their related associations and functions. The law is evolving and the validity of those types of patents has been and continues to be unclear. If certain SNPs and genes are patented, the validity of such patents is unclear and it is uncertain whether we may need to obtain rights to those SNPs and genes to develop, use, and sell related assays and other types of products or services utilizing such SNPs and genes. Required licenses may not be available on commercially acceptable terms. If we were to fail to obtain licenses to certain patented SNPs and genes claimed under valid patents, we might never achieve significant revenues from our diagnostic product development.\nWe may not be able to successfully adapt or maintain our products for commercial applications.\nA number of potential applications of our technology and potential products and tests, including diagnostic applications for noninvasive prenatal and other molecular testing, may require significant enhancements in our core technology or the in-licensing of intellectual property rights or technologies. In connection with developing new products and applications, we may not effectively deploy our research and development efforts in a cost-efficient manner or otherwise in a manner that leads to the successful commercialization and scale-up of such products and applications. If we are not successful enhancing our technology or the in-licensing of technology our products or tests may not achieve or maintain a significant level of market acceptance, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.\nWe may not be able to successfully compete in the diagnostic industry.\nThe diagnostic industry is highly competitive. We expect to compete with a broad range of companies in the U.S. and other countries that are engaged in the development and production of products, tests, applications, services, and strategies to develop and commercialize diagnostic, noninvasive prenatal diagnostic, oncology and other products and tests for customers in the molecular medicine fields as well as diagnostic service laboratories and customers in other markets. They include:\n\u2022\nbiotechnology, diagnostic, and other life science companies;\n\u2022\nacademic and scientific institutions;\n\u2022\ngovernmental agencies; and\n\u2022\npublic and private research organizations.\nSome of our competitors and/or potential competitors have greater financial, technical, research, marketing, sales, distribution, operations, service, and other resources than we do. Our competitors may offer broader product lines and services\nand have greater name recognition than we do. Several companies are currently offering, making, or developing products and tests that compete with our tests. Our competitors may develop or market technologies, tests or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future tests or products that may render our technologies or products or tests obsolete or that have superior intellectual property rights. We have limited experience in the field of oncology and we cannot guarantee that our research and development activities will be successful in developing any marketable oncology testing service.\nIf we do not effectively manage our business as it grows and evolves, it could affect our internal operations as well as our ability to pursue opportunities and expand our business.\nAs our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we expect to expand our employee base for managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure and may impact our ability to maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting. In addition, evolution in our business, particularly our transition to developing and commercializing molecular diagnostic tests, has placed and may continue to place a significant strain on our personnel, facilities, management systems, information technology infrastructure, disclosure controls, internal controls and resources. If we fail to effectively manage the evolution of our business and the transition to also being a provider of diagnostic products and tests, or fail to take other necessary action to maintain close coordination among our various departments, our ability to execute on our business plan, maintain our credibility, pursue business opportunities, maintain and expand our business, and sell our products and tests in new markets may be adversely affected.\nWe may not successfully complete the sale, or acquisition of, or merger, or joint venture with businesses that we desire to acquire, merge, or partner with.\nWe may acquire additional businesses or technologies, merge or form joint ventures with other businesses, or enter into other strategic transactions. Managing and completing future acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures, sales, or other strategic transactions entails numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe inability to retain key employees of any acquired or merged businesses or hire enough qualified personnel to staff any new or expanded operations;\n\u2022\nthe impairment of relationships with key customers of acquired or merged businesses due to changes in management and ownership of the acquired or merged businesses;\n\u2022\nthe inability to sublease on financially acceptable terms excess leased space or terminate lease obligations of acquired or merged businesses that are not necessary or useful for the operation of our business;\n\u2022\nthe exposure to federal, state, local and foreign tax liabilities in connection with any acquisition or merger or the integration of any acquired or merged businesses;\n\u2022\nthe exposure to unknown liabilities or disputes with the former stakeholders or management or employees of acquired or merged businesses;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected acquisition or merger and integration expenses that would cause our quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate;\n\u2022\nincreased amortization expenses if an acquisition or merger results in significant intangible assets;\n\u2022\ncombining the operations and personnel of acquired businesses with our own, which would be difficult and costly;\n\u2022\ndisputes over rights to acquired or accessed technologies or with licensors or licensees of those technologies; and\n\u2022\nintegrating or completing the development and application of any acquired or accessed technologies, which would disrupt our business and divert management's time and attention.\nWe may also attempt to acquire businesses or technologies, merge businesses or form joint ventures, or attempt to enter into strategic transactions that we are unable to complete. If we are unable to complete such transactions, we may expend substantial resources and ultimately not successfully complete the transaction. Such transactions may also distract management and result in other adverse effects on our business and operations. These transactions may also involve the issuance of shares of our capital stock, which may result in dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may potentially compete with our customers or licensees, which may adversely affect our business.\nWe have entered into diagnostic test services agreements and license agreements, for the MaterniT21 PLUS test, substantially similar tests, and other test services. Some of these contractual partners send patient samples to Sequenom Laboratories for test services and other partners perform the testing in their own laboratory or plan to do so in the future. In addition, we expect more third-party laboratories will license the pooled intellectual property created as a result of the Pooled Patents Agreement. Although there are many potential business opportunities, our customers and licensees may seek diagnostic\ntesting service business from clients or potential clients that we already have as clients or have chosen to pursue. In such cases we will likely compete against our customers or licensees. Competition from our customers or licensees may adversely affect our business or our ability to successfully commercialize our diagnostic testing services.\nIf we cannot attract and retain highly-skilled personnel, our growth might not proceed as rapidly as we intend and our business may be adversely affected.\nThe success of our business will depend on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain, maintain, and motivate highly skilled personnel, particularly sales, scientific, medical, laboratory, CLIA laboratory, and technical personnel, for our future success. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense, in particular for licensed laboratory technicians in the state of California, and we might not succeed in attracting and retaining these employees. If we cannot attract and retain the personnel we require, we would not be able to expand our business as rapidly as we intend. When we seek to hire personnel to fill open positions, we may be unable to hire qualified replacements for the positions that we need to fill, and there may be significant costs associated with the recruiting, hiring and retention of officers and employees for the open positions. The market price of our common stock has decreased over time, which has reduced the retention value of many of our prior equity awards made to our employees and officers. If we lose key employees, officers, scientists, physician collaborators or if our management team is not able to effectively manage us through these events, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. We do not carry \u201ckey person\u201d insurance covering any of our officers or other employees.\nOur success is dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees, and any accident or disability suffered by an executive officer or key employee could adversely impact our business.\nOur business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees. If an executive officer is incapacitated or disabled by accident, sickness or otherwise so as to render such individual mentally or physically incapable of performing the services and duties required to be performed by such individual, it may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management expects to continue to devote substantial time to public company compliance programs.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses due to our compliance with regulations and disclosure obligations applicable to us, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market. The SEC and other regulators have continued to adopt new rules and regulations and make additional changes to existing regulations that require our compliance. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that have required the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact (in ways we cannot currently anticipate) the manner in which we operate our business. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance programs and monitoring of public company reporting obligations and, as a result of the new corporate governance and executive compensation related rules, regulations and guidelines prompted by the Dodd-Frank Act and further regulations and disclosure obligations expected in the future, we will likely need to devote additional time and costs to comply with such compliance programs and rules. These rules and regulations will continue to cause us to incur significant legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our foreign business activities.\nWe expect that a portion of our sales will continue to be made outside the U.S. Revenues from our international licensees increased during the year ended December 31, 2014. A successful international effort will require us to develop relationships with international customers and collaborators, including licensees and distributors. We may not be able to identify, attract, retain, or maintain suitable international customers or collaborators. Expansion into international markets may require us to hire additional personnel to develop relationships with foreign customers and collaborators, licensees or distributors and maintain good relations with our foreign customers and collaborators, licensees or distributors. International business activities include many of the same risks to our business that affect our domestic operations, but also involve a number of risks not typically present in domestic operations, including:\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuation risks;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nlicenses, tariffs, and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability and possible country-based boycotts;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other countries\u2019 anti-corruption laws;\n\u2022\nthe burden of complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties; and\n\u2022\ndifferent rules, regulations, and policies governing intellectual property protection and enforcement.\nOur international business is subject to additional laws and regulations that could result in increased operational costs and risk. For example, the European Union, or EU, is currently in the midst of reviewing updates to the EU Privacy Directive that would result in additional requirements and costs if passed, such as the appointment of a dedicated privacy officer and increased civil and criminal penalties in the event of any loss or unauthorized disclosure of private information related to any resident of the EU.\nWe must be in compliance with state and federal security and privacy regulations, which may increase our operational costs.\nThe privacy and security regulations under HIPAA establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures of protected heath information, or PHI, by health plans and health care providers, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic PHI. The regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe circumstances under which uses and disclosures of PHI are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, to obtain payments for services and health care operations activities;\n\u2022\na patient's rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of PHI;\n\u2022\nthe content of notices of privacy practices for PHI; and\n\u2022\nadministrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive PHI electronically.\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, which became effective on February 17, 2010, makes HIPAA's privacy and security standards directly applicable to \u201cbusiness associates\u201d-independent contractors or agents of covered entities that have access to protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. We are a covered entity and also a business associate of our covered entity customers. Among other things, HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney's fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.\nAs we expand our business we must continue to implement policies and procedures related to compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations, as required by law, which may increase our operational costs. Furthermore, the privacy and security regulations provide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of PHI, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. We have evaluated the security of our computer networks and determined that appropriate measures are in place to safeguard PHI contained on such networks. However, no security system is invulnerable to breach, and unauthorized persons may in the future be able to exploit weaknesses in the security systems of our computer networks and gain access to such PHI. Additionally, we share PHI with third-party contractors who are contractually obligated to safeguard and maintain the confidentiality of PHI. Unauthorized persons may be able to gain access to PHI stored in such third-party contractors' computer networks. Any wrongful use or disclosure of PHI by us or our third-party contractors, including disclosure due to data theft or unauthorized access to our or our third-party contractors' computer networks, could subject us to fines or penalties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Although the HIPAA statute and regulations do not expressly provide for a private right of damages, we also could incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information by us or our third-party contractors.\nIn addition, different states and foreign nations, such as the EU, also impose certain requirements on the collection of all types of personal information. For example, the European Union Privacy Directive requires that we adhere to certain \u201csafe harbor\u201d requirements with respect to any personal information of a European resident or customer while various states in the U.S. have implemented equally restrictive requirements, such as 201 CMR 17.00, which requires that any company that obtains personal information of any resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts implement and maintain a security program that adequately protects such information from unauthorized use or disclosure. As a business that operates both internationally and across all fifty states, any wrongful use or disclosure of personally identifiable information, even if it does not constitute PHI, by us or our third-party contractors, including disclosure due to data theft or unauthorized access to our or our third-party contractors' computer networks, could subject us to fines or penalties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations, including the cost of providing credit monitoring and identity theft prevention services to affected consumers and loss of EU Safe harbor certification.\nSecurity threats to our IT infrastructure and/or our physical buildings could expose us to liability, and damage our reputation and business.\nIt is essential to our business strategy that our technology and network infrastructure and our physical buildings remain secure and are perceived by our customers and corporate partners to be secure. Despite security measures, however, any network infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks by hackers and other security threats. As a leader in the field of molecular diagnostic testing and genetics analysis, we may face cyber-attacks that attempt to penetrate our network security, including our data centers, to sabotage or otherwise disable our research, products and services, misappropriate our or our customers' and partners' proprietary information, which may include personally identifiable information, or cause interruptions of our internal systems and services. Despite security measures, we also cannot guarantee security of our physical buildings. If successful, physical building penetration or any cyber-attacks could negatively affect our reputation, damage our network infrastructure and our ability to deploy our products and services, and harm our relationship with customers and partners that are affected, and expose us to financial liability. We maintain cyber security risk insurance coverage, however any uncovered claim or a claim in excess of our insurance coverage would have to be paid out of our cash reserves, which could have a detrimental effect on our financial condition. It is difficult to determine whether we have sufficient insurance coverage to cover potential claims. Also, we may not be able to procure or maintain insurance policies with desirable levels of coverage on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to avoid significant claims, which could hurt our reputation and our financial condition.\nWe may not have adequate insurance if we become subject to product liability or other claims.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability and other types of claims and our exposure will increase as we and Sequenom Laboratories and our partners and collaborators expand commercialization of our tests including the MaterniT21 PLUS test. We have product and general liability insurance that covers us against specific product liability and other claims up to an annual aggregate limit of $30.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively. Any claim in excess of our insurance coverage would have to be paid out of our cash reserves, which would have a detrimental effect on our financial condition. It is difficult to determine whether we have obtained sufficient insurance to cover potential claims. Also, we cannot assure you that we can or will maintain our insurance policies on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to avoid significant product liability claims, which could hurt our reputation and our financial condition.\nResponding to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous chemicals, and radioactive and biological materials that we use could be time consuming and costly.\nWe use controlled hazardous and radioactive materials in the conduct of our business, as well as biological materials that have the potential to transmit disease. The risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. If an accident with these substances occurs, we could be liable for any damages that result, which could seriously harm our business. Additionally, an accident could damage our research and manufacturing facilities and operations, resulting in delays and increased costs. Such damage and any expense resulting from delays, disruptions, or any claims may not be covered by our insurance policies.\nHostile takeover bids and unsolicited offers could adversely impact our value and cause the trading price of our common stock to fall.\nThe current economic environment may encourage potential acquirers to make unsolicited and under-priced offers to acquire our business. If we are the target of a hostile takeover bid or unsolicited offer that undervalues our company, such hostile takeover bid or unsolicited offer may adversely impact public perception of the value of our company, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall. In addition, such hostile takeover bids or unsolicited offers may distract management and result in other adverse effects on our business and operations.\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile, and your investment could suffer a decline in value.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour ability to generate cash flow and continue as a going concern;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly and annual operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding technological innovations, intellectual property rights, the outcome of patent litigation, research and development progress or setbacks, or product launches by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nour success in entering into, and the success in performing under, licensing and product and test development and commercialization agreements with others;\n\u2022\nthe success of validation studies for tests under development and our ability to continue to publish study results in peer-reviewed journals;\n\u2022\nour success in and the expenses associated with researching, developing, commercializing, and obtaining reimbursement for diagnostic products and tests, alone or in collaboration with our partners and obtaining any required regulatory approval for those products and tests;\n\u2022\nthe status of litigation against us; and\n\u2022\nsecurities analysts' earnings projections or recommendations, third-party research recommendations, or general market conditions.\nThe stock market in general, The NASDAQ Global Select Market, and the market for life sciences companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that may have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the listed companies. These price fluctuations may be rapid and severe and may leave investors little time to react. Broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance, and may expose us to potential securities class-action litigation.\nWe have in the past identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not effectively remediated, result in additional material misstatements in our financial statements.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As disclosed in Item 9A of our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K, management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of these material weaknesses in conjunction with the 2012 Annual Report, our management concluded at that time that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-An Integrated Framework. In 2013, we implemented a remediation plan designed to address these material weaknesses. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results, which could lead to substantial additional costs for accounting and legal fees.", "PERMNO": 87632, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "SQNM"}
