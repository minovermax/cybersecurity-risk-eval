RISK FACTORS\nDescribed below are risks, which are categorized as \u201cRisk Factors Relating to Our Business,\u201d \u201cRisk Factors Relating to the Regulatory Environment,\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors Relating to Our Employees,\u201d that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows or could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d that precedes Part I of this report. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial may in the future have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\nPotential costs related to the environmental cleanup of Portland Harbor may be material to our financial position and liquidity\nIn December 2000, we were notified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d) that we are one of the potentially responsible parties (\u201cPRPs\u201d) that owns or operates or formerly owned or operated sites which are part of or adjacent to Portland Harbor. In January 2017, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (\u201cROD\u201d) that identified the selected remedy for Portland Harbor. The EPA has estimated the total cost of the selected remedy at $1.7 billion with a net present value cost of $1.05 billion (at a 7% discount rate) and an estimated construction period of 13 years following completion of the remedial designs. In the ROD, the EPA stated that the cost estimate is an order-of-magnitude engineering estimate that is expected to be within +50% to -30% of the actual project cost and that changes in the cost elements are likely to occur as a result of new information and data collected during the engineering design. The ROD provided only site-wide cost estimates and did not provide sufficient detail to estimate costs for specific sediment management areas within Portland Harbor. In addition, the ROD did not determine or allocate the responsibility for remediation costs among the PRPs. Except for certain early action projects in which we are not involved, remediation activities at Portland Harbor are not expected to commence for a number of years. Moreover, those activities are expected to be sequenced, and the order and timing of such sequencing has not been determined. We have joined with approximately 100 other PRPs in a voluntary process to establish an allocation of costs at Portland Harbor. We expect the next major stage of the allocation process to proceed in parallel with the remedial design process. In addition to the remedial action process overseen by the EPA, the Portland Harbor Natural Resource Trustee Council (\u201cTrustee Council\u201d) is assessing natural resource damages at Portland Harbor. We are working with the Trustee Council to finalize an early settlement of our alleged natural resource damage liability at Portland Harbor. Our environmental liabilities as of both August 31, 2022 and 2021 included $6 million relating to the Portland Harbor matters described above. Because the final remedial actions have not yet been designed and there has not been a determination of the allocation among the PRPs of costs of the investigations or remedial action costs, we believe it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount or range of costs which we are likely to or which it is reasonably possible that we will incur in connection with Portland Harbor, although such costs could be material to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. Among the facts being evaluated are detailed information on the history of ownership of and the nature of the uses of and activities and operations performed on each property within Portland Harbor, which are factors that will play a substantial role in determining the allocation of investigation and remedy costs among the PRPs. We have insurance policies that we believe will provide reimbursement for costs we incur for defense, remedial design, remedial action, and mitigation for or settlement of natural resource damages claims in connection with Portland Harbor. Most of these policies jointly insure us and MMGL, LLC (\u201cMMGL\u201d), an unaffiliated company, as the successor to a former subsidiary. We and MMGL have negotiated the settlement with certain insurers of claims against us related to Portland Harbor, continue to seek settlements with other insurers, and formed a Qualified Settlement Fund (\u201cQSF\u201d) which became operative in fiscal 2020 to hold such settlement amounts until funds are needed to pay or reimburse costs incurred by us and MMGL in connection with Portland Harbor. These insurance policies and the funds in the QSF may not cover all of the costs which we may incur.\n15 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2022\nThe Oregon Department of Environmental Quality is separately providing oversight of our investigations and source control activities at various sites adjacent to Portland Harbor that are focused on controlling any current \u201cuplands\u201d releases of contaminants into the Willamette River. We have accrued liabilities for source control and related work at two sites, reflecting estimated costs of primarily investigation and design, which costs have not been material in the aggregate to date. No liabilities have been established in connection with investigations for any other sites because the extent of contamination, required source control work, and our responsibility for the contamination and source control work, in each case if any, have not yet been determined. In addition, pursuant to our insurance policies, we are being reimbursed for the costs we incur for required source control evaluation and remediation work.\nSignificant cash outflows in the future related to Portland Harbor could reduce the amount of our borrowing capacity that could otherwise be used for investment in capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases. Any material liabilities or cash expenditures, net of recoveries, incurred in the future related to Portland Harbor could result in our failure to maintain compliance with certain covenants in our debt agreements. See \u201cContingencies - Environmental\u201d in Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further detail on these matters.\nEquipment upgrades, equipment failures, and facility damage may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns\nOur business operations and recycling and manufacturing processes depend on critical pieces of equipment, including information technology equipment, shredders, nonferrous sorting technology, furnaces, and a rolling mill, which may be out of service occasionally for scheduled upgrades or maintenance or as a result of unanticipated failures or events. Our facilities are subject to equipment failures and the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as mechanical failures, fires, earthquakes, accidents, or violent weather conditions. For instance, although the impact on our operations was not significant, certain of our facilities in Puerto Rico have experienced damage due to hurricanes, including as a result of Hurricane Fiona in September 2022, and certain facilities in California, Oregon, and Washington were briefly closed in September 2020 due to poor air quality as a result of wildfires. Additionally, we experienced a fire at our Cascade Steel Rolling Mills in McMinnville, Oregon in May 2021 as well as at our metals recycling facility in Everett, Massachusetts in December 2021. Direct physical loss or damage to property from these incidents was limited to the mill\u2019s melt shop in the case of the steel mill and to the shredder building and equipment in the case of the Everett recycling facility, with no bodily injuries and no physical loss or damage to other buildings or equipment. With respect to the Everett facility shredder fire, on January 28, 2022, shredding operations at the facility began ramping up following the replacement and repairs to shredder equipment that had been damaged. Completion of the remainder of repair and replacement of property that experienced physical loss or damage, primarily buildings and improvements, will occur over a longer period and impacts on business income may continue. For example, as of June 18, 2022, shredder operations temporarily ceased at the facility pending completion of discussions with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and the Massachusetts Attorney General's office regarding installation and operation of temporary emission capture and controls that would allow operation of the shredder prior to completion of the repair and replacement of the shredder enclosure building. Non-shredding operations at the facility continue. While we carry insurance that we anticipate will cover repair and replacement of property that experienced physical loss or damage and business income losses resulting from these fires, as discussed in Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, and various conditions, exclusions, and limits. Moreover, our insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses in the case of future events. In addition, insurance may not continue to be available in the future on acceptable terms or at acceptable costs. Interruptions in our processing and production capabilities and shutdowns resulting from unanticipated events also could disrupt customer and supplier relationships and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n16 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2022\nFailure to realize or delays in realizing expected benefits from capital projects, including investments in processing and manufacturing technology improvements, may impact our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows\nWe may engage in capital projects based on the forecasted project economics, political and regulatory environments, and the expected return on the capital to be employed in the project. Large-scale projects may take many years to complete, during which time the political and regulatory environment or other market conditions may change from our forecast. For example, we make significant investments in processing and manufacturing technology improvements aimed at increasing the efficiency and capabilities of our businesses and to maximize our economies of scale. Completion of and realization of the benefits from such improvements may be subject to many factors including, but not limited to, permitting, construction, equipment delivery, commissioning and ramp up, environmental compliance, and technology performance risks, some of which are outside our control and could result in further delays in such projects or require us to incur additional costs. The COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing global impacts resulting directly or indirectly from the pandemic, including supply chain disruptions, have contributed to some delays in construction activities and equipment deliveries related to our capital projects, and to the time required to obtain permits from government agencies, resulting in the deferral of certain capital expenditures and in the timing of realization of the anticipated benefits of the technology improvements. Given the continually evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, its ongoing global impacts, and other factors impacting the timing of project completion, the extent to which forecasted capital expenditures could be deferred is uncertain. We have also experienced increased commissioning and ramp-up times on some projects. Failure to realize or delays in realizing the anticipated benefits and to generate adequate returns on such capital projects may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe operate in industries that are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows\nDemand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. The timing and magnitude of the cycles in the industries in which our products are used, including global steel manufacturing and nonresidential and infrastructure construction in the U.S., are difficult to predict. The cyclical nature of our operations tends to reflect and be amplified by changes in economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, the effects of inflation, changes in interest rates, and foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Increasing interest rates, both domestically and internationally, could lead to slowdowns in global investment and production, resulting in reduced generation of scrap and decreased demand for our products. For example, export net selling prices for recycled ferrous metal decreased by approximately $230 per ton, or approximately 40%, between May and June 2022, reflecting weaker demand primarily from slower global growth, including due to the impact of China COVID-19 lockdowns, inflationary pressure including high energy prices, the strength of the U.S. Dollar, and steel inventory destocking. Similarly, market demand for most recycled nonferrous metals softened beginning in May 2022 resulting in selling prices declining sharply for a period followed by a partial recovery near the end of fiscal 2022. In addition, in fiscal 2022, increasing inflation impacted our operating costs, including, but not limited to, employee compensation costs and certain costs of production. Economic downturns or a prolonged period of slow growth in the U.S. and foreign markets or any of the industries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n17 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2022\nChanging conditions in global markets including the impact of sanctions and tariffs, quotas, and other trade actions and import restrictions may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows\nWe generate a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to customers located outside the U.S., including countries in Asia, the Mediterranean region, and North, Central, and South America. In each of the last three years, exports comprised approximately 61 to 66 percent of our ferrous sales volumes and 57 to 65 percent of our nonferrous sales volumes. Our ability to sell our products profitably, or at all, into international markets is subject to a number of risks including adverse impacts of political, economic, military, terrorist, or major pandemic events; labor and social issues; legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments including quotas, tariffs, or other protectionist trade barriers, sanctions, adverse tax law changes, nationalization, currency restrictions, or import restrictions for certain types of products we export; and disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or other actions of government agencies. The occurrence of such events and conditions may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.\nFor example, in fiscal 2017, regulators in China began implementing the National Sword initiative involving inspections of Chinese industrial enterprises, including recyclers, in order to identify rules violations with respect to discharge of pollutants or illegally transferred scrap imports. Restrictions resulting from the National Sword initiative include a ban on certain imported recycled products, lower contamination limits for permitted recycled materials, and more comprehensive pre- and post-shipment inspection requirements. Disruptions in pre-inspection certifications and stringent inspection procedures at certain Chinese destination ports have limited access to these destinations and resulted in the renegotiation or cancellation of certain nonferrous customer contracts in connection with the redirection of such shipments to alternate destinations. Commencing July 1, 2019, China imposed further restrictions in the form of import license requirements and quotas on certain scrap products, including certain nonferrous products we sell. Chinese import licenses and quotas are issued to Chinese scrap consumers on a quarterly basis for the importation of scrap products. Since the implementation of this program, the size of import quotas has been steadily reduced on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We have continued to sell our recycled metal products into China; however, additional or modified license requirements and quotas, as well as additional product quality requirements, may be issued in the future. We believe that the potential impact on our recycling operations of the Chinese regulatory actions described above could include requirements that would necessitate additional processing and packaging of certain recycled nonferrous metal products, increased inspection and certification activities with respect to exports to China, or a change in the use of our sales channels in the event of delays in the issuance of licenses, restrictive quotas, or an outright ban on certain or all of our recycled metals products by China. As regulatory developments progress, we may need to make further investments in nonferrous processing equipment beyond existing planned investments where economically justified, incur additional costs in order to comply with new inspection requirements, or seek alternative markets for the impacted products, which may result in lower sales prices or higher costs and may adversely impact our business or results of operations.\nIn March 2018, the U.S. imposed a 25 percent tariff on certain imported steel products and a 10 percent tariff on certain imported aluminum products under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Currently, imports from certain countries are exempt from these duties pursuant to various agreements, including quotas. These tariffs, along with other U.S. trade actions, have triggered retaliatory actions by certain affected countries, and other foreign governments may impose trade measures on other U.S. goods in the future. For example, China has imposed a series of retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. products, including a 25 percent tariff on all grades of U.S. scrap and an additional 25 percent tariff on U.S. aluminum scrap. These tariffs and other trade actions could result in a decrease in international steel demand and negatively impact demand for our products, which would adversely impact our business. Given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of these trade actions by the U.S. or other countries, the impact of the trade actions on our operations or results remains uncertain, but this impact could be material.\n18 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2022\nIncreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may reduce the demand for our products\nA significant portion of our recycled metal revenues is generated from sales to foreign customers, which are denominated in U.S. dollars. In our fiscal 2022, the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to other world currencies. A strengthening U.S. dollar makes our products more expensive for non-U.S. customers, which may negatively impact our export sales. A strengthening U.S. dollar also makes imported metal products less expensive, which may result in an increase in imports of steel products into the U.S. As a result, our finished steel products, which are made in the U.S., may become more expensive for our U.S. customers relative to imported steel products thereby reducing demand for our products.\nEconomic and geopolitical instability including as a result of military conflict could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows\nIn late February 2022, Russian military forces launched significant military action against Ukraine, which has continued through the date of this report. We do not have operations in Russia or Ukraine. Nevertheless, the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting sanctions by U.S. and European governments, together with any additional future sanctions by them, could have a larger impact that expands into other geographies where we do business, including our supply chain, business partners, and customers in those markets, which could result in lost sales, supply shortages, commodity price fluctuations, increased manufacturing costs, transportation logistics challenges, customer credit and liquidity issues, and lost efficiencies. The acceleration of a global energy crisis including as a result of restrictions on Russia's energy exports could similarly impact the geographies where we do business. In addition, the U.S. has commenced certain trade actions as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which are expected to result in retaliatory measures or actions, including tariffs, by Russia. While significant uncertainty exists with respect to this matter, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and its broader impacts, including any increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade imposed by the U.S. or further retaliatory trade measures taken by Russia or other countries in response, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.\nChanges in the availability or price of inputs such as raw materials and end-of-life vehicles could reduce our sales\nOur businesses require certain materials that are sourced from third-party suppliers. Although the synergies from our integrated operations allow us to be our own source for some raw materials, particularly with respect to recycled metal for our steel manufacturing operations, we rely on other suppliers for most of our raw material and other input needs, including inputs to steel production such as graphite electrodes, alloys, and other required consumables. Industry supply conditions generally involve risks, including the possibility of shortages of raw materials, increases in raw material and other input costs, and reduced control over delivery schedules. We procure our scrap inventory from numerous sources. These suppliers generally are not bound by long-term contracts and have no obligation to sell scrap metal to us. In periods of declining or lower recycled metal prices suppliers may elect to hold scrap metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities, tightening supply. If a substantial number of suppliers cease selling scrap metal to us, we will be unable to recycle metal at desired levels, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. For instance, in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, a lower price environment for recycled metals in combination with economic and other restrictions on suppliers relating to COVID-19 severely constricted the supply of scrap metal including end-of-life vehicles, which resulted in significantly reduced processed volumes. A slowdown of industrial production in the U.S. may also reduce the supply of industrial grades of metal to the metals recycling industry, resulting in less recyclable metal available to process and market. Increased competition for domestic scrap metal, including as a result of overcapacity or consolidation in the metal recycling industry in the U.S. and Canada, may also reduce the supply of scrap metal available to us. Failure to obtain a steady supply of recyclable material could both adversely impact our ability to meet sales commitments and reduce our operating margins. Failure to obtain an adequate supply of end-of-life vehicles, including due to increasing trends over time in the proportion of electric vehicles sold to total vehicles sold, the pace of and the auto recycling industry response to which are uncertain, could adversely impact our ability to attract customers and charge admission fees and reduce parts sales at our auto parts stores. Failure to obtain raw materials and other inputs to steel production, such as graphite electrodes, alloys, and other required consumables, could adversely impact our ability to make steel to the specifications of our customers.\n19 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2022\nSignificant decreases in recycled metal prices may adversely impact our operating results\nThe timing and magnitude of the cycles in the industries in which we operate are difficult to predict and are influenced by different economic conditions in the domestic market, where we typically acquire our raw materials, and foreign markets, where we typically sell the majority of our products. Purchase prices for scrap metal including end-of-life vehicles and selling prices for recycled metal are subject to market forces beyond our control. While we attempt to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices through adjustments to our metal purchase prices, our ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors. As a result, we may not be able to reduce our metal purchase prices to fully offset a sharp reduction in recycled metal sales prices, which may adversely impact our operating income and cash flows. In addition, a rapid decrease in selling prices may compress our operating margins due to the impact of average inventory cost accounting, which causes cost of goods sold recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to decrease at a slower rate than metal purchase prices. For instance, in fiscal 2020, weaker market conditions for recycled metals, including as a result of the sharp decline in global economic conditions during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 in large part due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and structural changes to the market for certain recycled nonferrous products primarily from Chinese import restrictions and tariffs, resulted in periods of sharply declining commodity prices and lower average net selling prices for our recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal products compared to recent prior periods. As a result, operating margins in fiscal 2020 compressed as the decline in average net selling prices for our recycled metal products outpaced the reduction in purchase costs for raw materials. In fiscal 2022, after rising strongly and reaching a peak in April 2022, market selling prices for recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals declined sharply in May through June, reflecting weaker demand primarily from slower global growth, including due to the impact of China COVID-19 lockdowns, inflationary pressure including high energy prices, the strength of the U.S. Dollar, and steel inventory destocking. For example, export net selling prices for recycled ferrous metal decreased by approximately $230 per ton, or approximately 40%, between May and June 2022, causing our operating margins to compress significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\nImbalances in supply and demand conditions in the global steel industry may reduce demand for our products\nEconomic expansions and contractions in global economies can result in supply and demand imbalances in the global steel industry that can significantly affect the price of commodities used and sold by our business, as well as the price of and demand for finished steel products. In a number of foreign countries, such as China, steel producers are generally government-owned and may therefore make production decisions based on political or other factors that do not reflect free market conditions. In the past, overcapacity and excess steel production in these foreign countries resulted in the export of aggressively priced semi-finished and finished steel products. This led to disruptions in steel-making operations within other countries, negatively impacting demand for our recycled metal products used by EAF mills globally as their primary feedstock. Further, the import of foreign steel products into the U.S. at similarly aggressive prices have in the past adversely impacted finished steel sales prices and sales volumes. Existing or new trade laws and regulations may cause or be inadequate to prevent disadvantageous trade practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although trade regulations restrict or impose duties on the importation of certain products, if foreign steel production significantly exceeds consumption in those countries, global demand for our recycled metal products could decline and imports of steel products into the U.S. could increase, resulting in lower volumes and selling prices for our recycled metal products and finished steel products.\n20 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2022\nAcquisitions and integration of acquired businesses may result in operating difficulties and other unintended consequences\nWe have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or expand into complementary businesses to enable us to expand our customer and supplier base and grow our revenues. Execution of any past or potential future acquisition or expansion involves several risks, including:\n\u2022Difficulty integrating the acquired businesses\u2019 personnel and operations;\n\u2022Challenges in obtaining permits or meeting other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022Potential loss of key employees, customers, or suppliers of the acquired business;\n\u2022Difficulties in realizing anticipated cost savings, efficiencies, and synergies;\n\u2022Unexpected costs;\n\u2022Inaccurate assessment of or undisclosed liabilities;\n\u2022Inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, and procedures;\n\u2022Disruption to existing businesses; and\n\u2022Difficulty in managing growth.\nIf we do not successfully execute on acquisitions or expansions and the acquired or expanded businesses do not perform as projected, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nSupply chain disruptions affecting our customers, end users of our recycled products, or our suppliers could adversely impact the demand for our products or the availability of inputs, increase our costs, or otherwise adversely impact our business\nSupply chain disruptions, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and related labor shortages and logistics constraints have and could continue to impact our customers, end users of our recycled products, and our suppliers and adversely impact our business. Direct and indirect impacts on our business of such supply chain disruptions could include reduction in the demand for and price of certain of our products, slowdown in flows of scrap metal from certain supply channels, and reduced availability or increases in costs of other inputs, consumables, supplies, and capital equipment. Disruptions within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to produce or deliver our products in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in reduced volumes and sales, increased supply chain costs, or damage to our reputation. Such disruptions in the future may result from a number of factors beyond our control. Supply chain disruptions due to any of those factors could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition.\nReliance on third-party shipping companies may restrict our ability to ship our products\nWe significantly rely on third parties to handle and transport raw materials to our production facilities and products to customers. Despite our practice of utilizing a diversified group of suppliers of transportation, factors beyond our control, including changes in fuel prices, political events, governmental regulation of transportation, changes in market rates, carrier availability, carrier bankruptcy, labor shortages, shipping industry consolidation, and disruptions in transportation routes and infrastructure, may adversely impact our ability to ship our products and our operating margins. These impacts could include delays or other disruptions in shipments in transit, including as a result of congested seaports and travel routes, or third-party shipping companies increasing their charges for transportation services or otherwise reducing or eliminating the availability of their containers, vehicles, rail cars, barges, or ships. For example, during fiscal 2022 and 2021, worldwide demand for logistical services increased sharply, which led to a global shortage of available shipping containers, congested seaports, and higher freight rates, impacting the timing of certain shipments and resulting in reductions in sales volumes of certain products. The delays in container shipping for U.S. exports have been exacerbated by the backlog of containerized imports at U.S. seaports. While we aim to pass on the majority of shipping and related charges to our customers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so into the future. As a result, we may not be able to transport our products in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and may harm our reputation.\n21 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2022\nGoodwill impairment charges may adversely affect our operating results\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the net amount of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination measured at fair value. As of August 31, 2022, we had $255 million of goodwill on our balance sheet. We test the goodwill balances allocated to our reporting units for impairment on an annual basis and when events occur or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of one or more of our reporting units with allocated goodwill may be below its carrying amount. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may be required to measure the fair value of the reporting units in order to determine the amount of impairment, if any. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to inherent uncertainties and changes in estimates and assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, discount rates, tax rates, terminal growth rates, benefits associated with a taxable transaction, and synergistic benefits available to market participants. A lack of recovery or further deterioration in market conditions, a trend of weaker than anticipated financial performance for one of our reporting units with allocated goodwill, a decline in our share price for a sustained period of time, or an increase in the market-based weighted average cost of capital, among other factors, are indicators that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable. We may be required to record a goodwill impairment charge that, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 8 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nImpairment of long-lived assets and equity investments may adversely affect our operating results\nOur long-lived asset groups are subject to an impairment assessment when certain triggering events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the operations related to the asset group, an impairment is recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset group. The results of these tests for potential impairment may be adversely affected by unfavorable market conditions, our financial performance trends, or an increase in interest rates, among other factors. If, as a result of the impairment test, we determine that the fair value of any of our long-lived asset groups is less than its carrying amount, we may incur an impairment charge that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We recorded impairment charges of $6 million on long-lived tangible and lease right-of-use assets associated with certain regional metals recycling operations and auto parts stores in fiscal 2020. With respect to our investments in unconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, a loss in value of an investment is recognized when the decline is other than temporary. With respect to our two equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, totaling $11 million as of August 31, 2022, we would recognize an impairment charge if our qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value. Impairment of our equity investments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further detail on long-lived asset impairment charges.\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Future epidemics or other public health emergencies could have similar effects.\nOur operations expose us to risks associated with pandemics, epidemics, or other public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 outbreak which the World Health Organization characterized as a pandemic in March 2020. We are a company operating in a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Consistent with federal guidelines and with state and local orders to date, we have continued to operate across our footprint throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The onset of COVID-19 negatively affected our business, which is most prominently reflected in our fiscal 2020 results. Beginning in our fiscal 2021, there has been a trend in many parts of the world of increasing availability and administration of vaccines against COVID-19, as well as an easing of restrictions on individual, business, and government activities. However, the existence of new or enduring variant strains of COVID-19 may cause delays in the easing of restrictions previously in place and the implementation of new restrictions and mandates, which could be applied differently across jurisdictions, and there are ongoing global impacts resulting directly or indirectly from the pandemic including labor shortages, logistical challenges and supply chain disruptions such as increased port congestion, and increases in costs for certain goods and services. These ongoing global impacts have negatively affected our sales volumes, operating costs, and financial results to varying degrees and could continue to negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position in the future.\n22 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2022\nInability to achieve or sustain the benefits from productivity, cost savings, and restructuring initiatives may adversely impact our operating results\nDuring the past several years, we implemented a number of productivity improvement, cost savings, and restructuring initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses and improve profitability and to achieve further integration and synergistic cost efficiencies in our operating platform. These initiatives included idling underutilized assets and closing facilities to more closely align our business to market conditions, implementing productivity initiatives to increase production efficiency and material recovery, and reducing certain operating expenses through headcount reductions, reducing organizational layers, consolidating shared service functions, savings from procurement activities, streamlining of administrative and supporting services functions, and other non-headcount measures. For example, in fiscal 2020, we implemented productivity initiatives targeted to achieve $20 million in realized benefits in fiscal 2020 by reducing our annual operating expenses, mainly through reductions in non-trade procurement spend, including outside and professional services, lower employee-related expenses, and other non-headcount measures. We may undertake similar or additional productivity initiatives in the future in the normal course or in response to market conditions. Our ability to achieve or sustain the anticipated cost reductions and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive, and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. We incurred restructuring charges and other exit-related activities as a result of these initiatives and may incur such charges in the future. Failure to achieve or sustain the expected cost reductions and other benefits related to these productivity improvements, cost savings, and restructuring initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to renew facility leases, thus restricting our ability to operate\nWe lease a significant portion of our facilities, including the substantial majority of our auto parts facilities. The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly, and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to renew these leases or find suitable alternative locations for our facilities may impact our ability to continue operations within certain geographic areas, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nChanging economic conditions may result in customers not fulfilling their contractual obligations\nWe enter into export ferrous sales contracts preceded by negotiations that include fixing price, quantity, shipping terms, and other contractual terms. Upon finalization of these terms and satisfactory completion of other contractual contingencies, the customer typically opens a letter of credit to satisfy its payment obligation under the contract prior to our shipment of the cargo. In times of changing economic conditions, including during periods of sharply falling recycled metal prices, there is an increased risk that customers may not be willing or able to fulfill their contractual obligations or open letters of credit. As of August 31, 2022 and 2021, 24% and 30%, respectively, of our accounts receivable balance were covered by letters of credit. In addition, in higher or rising commodity price environments and during periods of challenging global macroeconomic and steel industry conditions, we have experienced proportionately lower credit insurance coverage of applicable customer credit limits, which may increase our exposure to customer credit risk.\nPotential limitations on our ability to access capital resources may restrict our ability to operate\nOur operations are capital intensive. Our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. While we expect that our cash requirements, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service, dividends, share repurchases, and investments, will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our secured committed bank credit facilities, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Additional acquisitions could require financing from external sources. Although we believe we have adequate access to contractually committed borrowings, we could be adversely affected if we are not able to meet the conditions required to incur such borrowing or if our banks ceased lending or were unable to honor their contractual commitments. Failure to access our credit facilities could restrict our ability to fund operations, make capital expenditures, or execute acquisitions.\n23 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2022\nThe agreement governing our bank credit facilities imposes certain restrictions on our business and contains financial covenants\nOur secured bank credit facilities contain certain restrictions on our business which limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things, incur or suffer to exist certain liens, make investments, incur or guaranty additional indebtedness, enter into consolidations, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of assets, make distributions and other restricted payments, change the nature of our business, engage in transactions with affiliates and enter into restrictive agreements, including agreements that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business or execute our strategy and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. Our bank credit agreement also requires that we maintain certain financial and other covenants, including a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a consolidated leverage ratio. Our ability to comply with these covenants may also be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry conditions. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or financial covenants could result in an event of default under the bank credit agreement and permit our lenders to cease lending to us and declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. This could require us to refinance our bank facilities, which we may not be able to do at terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nConsolidation in the steel industry may reduce demand for our products\nThere has been consolidation in the steel industry that has included steel mills acquiring steel fabricators to ensure demand for their products. If any of our steel mill\u2019s significant remaining customers were to be acquired by competing steel mills, this could reduce the demand for our products and force us to lower our prices, reducing our revenues, or to reduce production, which could increase our unit costs and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nProduct liability claims may adversely impact our operating results\nWe could inadvertently acquire radioactive scrap metal that could potentially be included in recycled mixed metal shipped to consumers worldwide. Although we have invested in radiation detection equipment in the majority of our locations, including the facilities from which we ship directly to customers, failure to detect radioactive metal remains a possibility. Even though we maintain insurance to address the risk of this failure in detection, there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage would be adequate or will continue to be available on acceptable terms. In addition, if we fail to meet contractual requirements for a product, we may be subject to product warranty costs and claims. These costs and claims could both have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and harm our reputation.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks that may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity\nWe spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign laws and regulations, contractual obligations and other legal standards. Notwithstanding this, we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks in respect of various matters, including regulatory, safety, environmental, employment, transportation, intellectual property, contractual, import/export, international trade, and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry. For example, legal proceedings can include those arising from accidents involving Company-owned vehicles, including Company tractor trailers. In some instances, such accidents and the related litigation involve accidents that have resulted in third-party fatalities. An outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation in excess of insurance recoveries could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For information regarding our current significant legal proceedings and contingencies, see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Part I, Item 3 and \u201cContingencies - Other\u201d in Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nClimate change may adversely impact our facilities and our ongoing operations\nThe potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and depend upon the unique geographic and environmental factors present, for example rising sea levels at our deepwater port facilities, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperature levels. As many of our recycling facilities are located near deepwater ports, rising sea levels may disrupt our ability to receive scrap metal, process the metal through our shredders, and ship products to our customers. Extreme weather events and conditions, such as wildfires, hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and snow or ice storms, may increase our costs or cause damage to our facilities, and any damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. Increased frequency and duration of adverse weather events and conditions may also inhibit construction activity utilizing our products, scrap metal inflows to our recycling facilities, and retail admissions and parts sales at our auto parts stores. Potential adverse impacts from climate change, including rising temperatures and extreme weather events and conditions, may create health and safety issues for employees operating at our facilities and may lead to an inability to maintain standard operating hours.\n24 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2022\nWe may not realize our deferred tax assets in the future\nThe assessment of recoverability of our deferred tax assets is based on an evaluation of existing positive and negative evidence as to whether it is more-likely-than-not that they will be realized. If negative evidence outweighs positive evidence, a valuation allowance is required. Impairment of deferred tax assets may result from significant negative industry or economic trends, a decrease in earnings performance and projections of future taxable income, adverse changes in laws or regulations, and a variety of other factors. Impairment of deferred tax assets could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition and could result in not realizing the deferred tax assets. In the past, we have recorded significant valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets may require further valuation allowances if it is not more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nTax increases and changes in tax rules may adversely affect our financial results\nAs a company conducting business on a global basis with physical operations throughout North America, we are exposed, both directly and indirectly, to the effects of changes in U.S., state, local, and foreign tax rules. Taxes for financial reporting purposes and cash tax liabilities in the future may be adversely affected by changes in such tax rules. Such changes may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our major competitors, to the extent we are unable to pass the tax costs through to our customers.\nThe Biden administration has announced in 2021 and 2022, and in certain cases has enacted, a number of tax proposals to fund new government investments in infrastructure, healthcare, and education, among other things. Certain of these proposals involve an increase in the domestic corporate tax rate, which if implemented could have a material impact on our future results of operations and cash flows. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (\u201cIRA\u201d) was signed into law, with tax provisions primarily focused on implementing a 15% minimum tax on global adjusted financial statement income and a 1% excise tax on share repurchases. The IRA also creates a number of potentially beneficial tax credits to incentivize investments in certain technologies and industries which may be applicable to our business. Certain provisions of the IRA will become effective beginning in fiscal 2023. While we do not believe the IRA will have a direct negative impact on our business, the effects of the measures are unknown at this time.\nOne or more cybersecurity incidents may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and reputation\nOur operations involve the use of multiple systems, some of which are outsourced to certain third-party service and hosting providers, that process, store, and transmit sensitive information about our customers, suppliers, employees, financial position, operating results, and strategies. We face global cybersecurity risks and threats on a continual and ongoing basis, which include, but are not limited to, attempts to access systems and information, computer viruses, or denial-of-service attacks. These risks and threats range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures. Increased numbers of employees working remotely increases our exposure to cyber-threats. While we are not aware of any material cyber-attacks or breaches of our systems to date, such attempts occur regularly and, thus, we have and continue to implement measures to safeguard our systems and information and mitigate potential risks, including employee training around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks, but there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use our systems, compromise sensitive information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt our operations. The occurrence of such events, including breaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers, could negatively impact our reputation and our competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, loss of business due to disruption of operations and/or reputational damage, potential liability and increased remediation and protection costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, as cybersecurity threats become more sophisticated, we may need to increase our investments in security measures which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to translation risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates\nOur operations in Canada expose us to translation risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the U.S. dollar, our reporting currency. As a result, we are subject to foreign currency exchange risks due to exchange rate movements in connection with the translation of the operating costs and the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations into our functional currency for inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n25 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2022\nRisk Factors Relating to the Regulatory Environment\nGovernmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our licenses and permits, thus restricting our ability to operate\nWe conduct certain aspects of our operations subject to licenses, permits, and approvals from state and local governments. Governmental agencies often resist the establishment of certain types of facilities in their communities, including metal recycling and auto parts facilities. Increased permitting requirements could require substantial additional capital expenditures, impose financial assurance obligations, subject us to increased compliance and penalty risks, severely limit operational flexibility, and increase operating costs, or adversely impact our ability to acquire or sell materials. Increased focus on strengthening environmental compliance and enforcement in overburdened communities that may be disproportionately impacted by adverse health and environmental effects may impact our ability to obtain or renew licenses and permits for facilities in or near such communities. In addition, changes in zoning and increased residential and mixed-use development near our facilities are reducing the buffer zones and creating land use conflicts with heavy industrial uses such as ours. This could result in increased complaints, increased inspections and enforcement including fines and penalties, operating restrictions, the need for additional capital expenditures, and increased opposition to maintaining or renewing required approvals, licenses, and permits. In addition, waste products from our operations are subject to classification and regulations that, among other things, determine how such materials may be handled, stored, transported, and disposed. Failure to obtain or maintain regulatory permits, approvals, or exemptions for such waste could materially increase our costs or limit our operations. For example, in fiscal 2022, as a result of court orders and regulatory changes, we were required at times to transport shredder waste from our Oakland facility out of state for disposal at increased costs. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Part I, Item 3. As an additional example, our Bay Area Air Quality Management District (\u201cBAAQMD\u201d) permit to operate currently limits the number of ships that may call at our Oakland, California facility to 26 ships per year. In July 2018, we applied for a modification of such permit to increase the number of annual ship calls to 32 per year. BAAQMD has not acted on our permit modification request but, in the interim, had routinely issued annual Compliance and Settlement Agreements (\u201cCSA\u201d) to permit 32 ship calls in each year. In October 2022, however, BAAQMD declined to renew the CSA for 2022, following which we applied for a short-term variance to authorize the 32 ship calls. Failure to obtain this variance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations through the end of calendar 2022 due to the reduced marine shipments, and lost profits related thereto, during the remainder of such period.\nFurthermore, from time to time, both the U.S. and foreign governments impose regulations and restrictions on trade in the markets in which we operate. In some countries, governments require us to apply for certificates or registration before allowing shipment of recycled metal to customers in those countries. There can be no assurance that future approvals, licenses, and permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the approvals, licenses, and permits we currently hold. Failure to obtain these approvals could cause us to limit or discontinue operations in these locations or prevent us from developing or acquiring new facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental compliance costs and potential environmental liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We are subject to local, state, and federal environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries relating to, among other matters:\n\u2022Waste disposal;\n\u2022Air emissions;\n\u2022Waste water and storm water management, treatment, and discharge;\n\u2022The use and treatment of groundwater;\n\u2022Soil and groundwater contamination and remediation;\n\u2022Generation, discharge, storage, handling, transportation, and disposal of hazardous materials and secondary materials;\n\u2022Employee health and safety; and\n\u2022Climate change generally.\n26 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2022\nWe are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain operations. Violation of or failure to obtain permits or comply with these laws or regulations could result in our business being fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators or becoming subject to litigation by private parties. In recent years, capital expenditures for environmental projects have increased and have represented a significant share of our annual capital expenditures. Future environmental compliance costs, including capital expenditures for environmental projects, may increase because of new laws and regulations, changing regulatory interpretations and stricter enforcement of current laws and regulations by regulatory authorities, expanding emissions, groundwater, storm water and other testing requirements, and new information on emission or contaminant levels including with respect to emerging contaminants such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (\"PFAS\"), uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels, the future costs of pollution control technology, and issues related to climate change.\nWe have seen an increased focus by federal, state, and local regulators on metals recycling and auto dismantling facilities and new or expanding regulatory requirements. For example, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (\u201cDTSC\u201d) has increased its enforcement actions and sought to impose additional permitting and regulatory requirements on the metals recycling industry in the state that has resulted in and could in the future increase operating and compliance costs and require additional capital expenditures. In addition, in July 2021, the EPA issued an enforcement alert reflecting a national enforcement initiative in conjunction with state regulators focused on Clean Air Act compliance at metal recycling facilities that operate auto and scrap metal shredders. While we believe we are an industry leader in air emission controls and have been working with state and local regulators on compliance and permitting matters, we have in the past and may in the future be subject to enforcement actions or litigation by regulators or private parties that could result in additional penalties, compliance requirements, or capital investments. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Part I, Item 3 of this report.\nIn addition, previous operations by us, predecessor entities, or others at facilities that we currently or formerly owned, operated, or otherwise used may have caused contamination from hazardous substances. As a result, we are exposed to possible claims, including government fines and penalties, costs for investigation and clean-up activities, claims for natural resources damages, and claims by third parties for personal injury and property damage, under environmental laws and regulations, especially for the remediation of waterways and soil or groundwater contamination. These laws can impose liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances even if the owner or operator was neither aware of nor responsible for the release of the hazardous substances. We have, in the past, incurred liabilities, expenditures, fines and penalties associated with violations of certain of these laws and regulations. In December 2000, we were notified by the EPA that we are one of the potentially responsible parties that owns or operates, or formerly owned or operated, sites which are part of or adjacent to Portland Harbor. Further, we have been notified that we are or may be a potentially responsible party at sites other than Portland Harbor currently or formerly owned or operated by us or at other sites where we may have responsibility for such costs due to past disposal or other activities. Environmental compliance costs and potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. See also the risk factor \u201cPotential costs related to the environmental cleanup of Portland Harbor may be material to our financial position and liquidity\u201d in this Item 1A and \u201cContingencies - Environmental\u201d in Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nThe Biden Administration and state and local regulators are also emphasizing efforts to strengthen environmental compliance and enforcement, including with respect to clean-up actions under superfund and hazardous waste laws, in overburdened communities that may be disproportionately impacted by adverse health and environmental effects. On September 10, 2021, U.S. EPA Region 9 and the California Environmental Protection Agency announced a joint effort to expand environmental enforcement in overburdened California communities. These initiatives could result in increased enforcement, compliance, and clean-up costs, including increased capital expenditures, at our facilities located at or near such communities.\n27 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2022\nCompliance with existing and future climate change, greenhouse gas, and other air emission laws and regulations may adversely impact our operating results\nRecent and future legislation or increased regulation regarding climate change and GHG emissions could impose significant costs on our business and our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, emissions controls, environmental monitoring and reporting, and other costs in order to comply with laws and regulations concerning and limitations imposed on climate change and GHG emissions. The potential costs of allowances, taxes, fees, offsets, or credits or additional emission reduction measures that may be part of \u201ccap and trade\u201d programs or other legislative or regulatory requirements are still uncertain and the future of these programs or measures is unknown. For example, in March 2020, the Governor of Oregon issued an executive order directing state agencies to take certain actions to reduce and regulate GHG emissions. Pursuant to this executive order, ODEQ adopted a new Climate Protection Program to limit GHG emissions in the state including from large stationary sources such as our steel mill. Pursuant to these regulations, the mill\u2019s GHG process emissions will be subject to a best available emission reduction technology analysis and standard and its natural gas GHG combustion emissions will be subject to the cap and annual reductions applied to its natural gas supplier. The implementation of such regulations, standards, and programs and any associated costs, including any operating or capital expenditures, are uncertain, but may be material to our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. The potential increased costs to us of natural gas supplies are also uncertain. In addition, the ODEQ Cleaner Air Oregon (\u201cCAO\u201d) program regulates toxic air emissions from manufacturing and commercial facilities located in Oregon. The ODEQ has published a prioritization list of the facilities within the state subject to the CAO program based on emissions inventories that facilities submitted to the ODEQ. The prioritization list established four tiers of risk groups. Our steel mill has been assigned to the first-tier risk group and entered the CAO program in 2020. To comply with the existing CAO program rules, and as they may be revised in the future, we must undertake an emissions inventory and a public health risk assessment. We may be required to incur additional operating or capital expenditures to mitigate any significant identified emissions risks, and such expenditures may be material. In addition, we have and continue to incur material capital expenditures to enclose and install additional emission controls for our shredders to meet air emission standards. Recent and future climate change and GHG laws or regulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such requirements. Until the timing, scope, and extent of any future laws or regulations becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition, operating performance, or ability to compete. Furthermore, even without such laws or regulations, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the metals recycling and steel manufacturing industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our products.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Employees\nLabor shortages or increased labor costs may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows\nOur employees contribute to developing and meeting our business goals and objectives, and labor is a significant component of operating our business. The impact of labor shortages or increased labor costs because of increased competition for employees, unemployment levels and benefits, higher employee turnover rates, increases in the federally-mandated or state-mandated minimum wage, change in exempt and non-exempt status, or other employee benefits costs (including costs associated with health insurance coverage or workers\u2019 compensation insurance), may increase our costs or impede our ability to operate our facilities and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. As a result of the tight labor markets we experienced during fiscal 2022 and 2021, we have received fewer job applicants in certain local markets, which hindered our ability to reach full staffing levels at some of our facilities. Recruiting and retaining employees in sufficient numbers to optimally staff our facilities may result in increases in our labor costs. Labor shortages and increased labor costs may continue to be realized as a direct or indirect result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including related response measures implemented by governments, or due to other factors, which may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.\nReliance on employees subject to collective bargaining may restrict our ability to operate\nApproximately 21% of our full-time employees are represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements, including substantially all of the manufacturing employees at our steel manufacturing facility. As these agreements expire, we may not be able to negotiate extensions or replacements of such agreements on acceptable terms. Any failure to reach an agreement with one or more of our unions may result in strikes, lockouts, or other labor actions, including work slowdowns or stoppages, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n28 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2022\nThe underfunded status of our multiemployer pension plans may cause us to increase our contributions to the plans\nAs discussed in Note 13 - Employee Benefits in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, we contribute to the Steelworkers Western Independent Shops Pension Plan (\u201cWISPP\u201d), a multiemployer plan benefiting union employees of our steel mill. Because we have no current intention of withdrawing from the WISPP, we have not recognized a withdrawal liability in our consolidated financial statements. However, if such a liability were triggered, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity, and cash flows. Our contributions to the WISPP could also increase as a result of a diminished contribution base due to the insolvency or withdrawal of other employers who currently contribute to it, the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liabilities, or other funding deficiencies, as we would need to fund the retirement obligations of these employers.\nIn 2004, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) approved a seven-year extension of the period over which the WISPP may amortize unfunded liabilities, conditioned upon maintenance of certain minimum funding levels. In 2014, the WISPP obtained relief from the specified funding requirements from the IRS, which requires that the WISPP meet a minimum funded percentage on each valuation date and achieve a funded percentage of 100% as of October 1, 2029. Based on the most recent actuarial valuation for the WISPP, the funded percentage using the valuation method prescribed by the IRS satisfied the minimum funded percentage requirement.", "PERMNO": 79866, "SIC": 5093, "TIC": "SCHN"}
