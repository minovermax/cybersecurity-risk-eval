{"cik": "791907", "company": "LINEAR TECHNOLOGY CORP /CA/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-08-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\ufeff\nA description of the risk factors associated with the Company is set forth below.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to the Analog Acquisition\n\ufeff\nOur business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the Analog Acquisition, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position and, following the completion of the Analog Acquisition, those of the combined company.\nParties with which we do business may be uncertain as to the effects on them from the Analog Acquisition and related transactions, including with respect to their current or future business relationships with us or the combined company. These relationships may be subject to disruption, as customers, suppliers and other persons with whom we have business relationships may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us, or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us or the combined company. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position or those of the combined company following the completion of the Analog Acquisition. The risk, and adverse effect, of any disruption could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the Analog Acquisition or termination of the Analog Merger Agreement.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Analog Merger Agreement subjects us to restrictions on our business activities.\nThe Analog Merger Agreement subjects us to restrictions on our business activities and generally obligates us to generally operate our businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course. These restrictions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nCompletion of the Analog Acquisition is subject to the conditions contained in the Analog Merger Agreement, and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Analog Acquisition will not be completed.\nOur obligations and the obligations of Analog Devices to complete the Analog Acquisition are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including the approval of the Analog Acquisition proposal by our stockholders, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d) and the receipt of all other required regulatory approvals. For a more complete summary of the required regulatory approvals and the conditions to the closing of the Analog Acquisition, please review the Analog Merger Agreement in its entirety, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Company\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 29, 2016.\nMany of the conditions to closing of the Analog Acquisition are not within our control, and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied. If any of these conditions are not satisfied or waived prior to April 26, 2017, which date will automatically be extended to October 26, 2017 under certain circumstances, it is possible that the Analog Merger Agreement will be terminated. Although we and Analog Devices have agreed in the Analog Merger Agreement to use reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to complete the Analog Acquisition as soon as practicable, these and other conditions to the completion of the Analog Acquisition may not be satisfied. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the Analog Acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the Analog Acquisition will be satisfied or waived or that the Analog Acquisition will be completed. See the risk factor below titled \u201cFailure to complete the Analog Acquisition could negatively affect our stock price, future business and financial results.\u201d\nThe Analog Acquisition is subject to the expiration of applicable waiting periods, and the receipt of approvals, consents or clearances from domestic and foreign regulatory authorities that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us or the combined company or, if not obtained, could prevent completion of the Analog Acquisition.\nBefore the Analog Acquisition may be completed, any waiting period (or extension thereof) applicable to the Analog Acquisition must have expired or been terminated, and any approvals, consents or clearances required in connection with the Analog Acquisition must have been obtained, in each case, under the HSR Act and under the antitrust and competition laws of China, Israel, Japan, Korea, the European Union (to the extent it has jurisdiction as a result of a referral request made pursuant to Article 4(5) of the EC Merger Regulation or Article 22 of the EC Merger Regulation, which we refer to in this annual report as a European Union specified merger control action), Romania (to the extent required by applicable law, unless a European specified merger control action occurs), Germany (unless a European Union specified merger control action occurs) and the United Kingdom (unless a European Union specified merger control action occurs, and to the extent there is a publication by the United Kingdom Competition & Markets Authority of an Invitation to Comment in relation to the transaction, on its website and/or on the Regulatory News Service of the London Stock Exchange). In addition, the Analog Acquisition may be reviewed under antitrust statutes of other governmental authorities, including U.S. state laws. In deciding whether to grant the required regulatory approval, consent or clearance, the relevant governmental entities will consider the effect of the Analog Acquisition on competition within their relevant jurisdiction. The terms and conditions of the approvals, consents and clearances that are granted may impose requirements, limitations or costs on, or place restrictions on the conduct of, the combined company\u2019s business. Under the Analog Merger Agreement, we and Analog Devices have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain such approvals, consents and clearances and therefore may be required to comply with conditions or limitations imposed by governmental authorities. However, Analog Devices will not be required to do any of the following in order to obtain any regulatory approval or otherwise to consummate the Analog Acquisition, and any requirement to do any of the following in order to obtain a required regulatory approval would result in the conditions to the consummation of the Analog Acquisition not being satisfied, unless waived by Analog Devices: (i) sell, divest, exclusively license, hold separate, or otherwise dispose of, or (ii) grant any non-exclusive license, accept any operational restrictions or take or commit to take any\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nactions which restrictions or actions would limit Analog Devices\u2019 or any of its affiliates\u2019 freedom of action, in each case with respect to assets, licenses, product lines, operations or businesses of Analog Devices, Linear Technology or any of their respective subsidiaries that individually or in the aggregate generated total collective revenues in excess of $125 million in Analog Devices or Linear Technology\u2019s fiscal year 2016, which we refer to in this annual report as the revenue cap. For purposes of clause (ii), the revenues of the asset, license, product line, operation or business impacted by such non-exclusive license, operational restriction or action will be considered in determining whether the revenue cap is met only if such restrictions would limit Analog Devices\u2019 or its affiliates\u2019 freedom of action with respect to the impacted asset, product line, operation or business after the effective time in a manner that is material to such impacted asset, product line, operation or business or, in the case of a non-exclusive license, the adverse effect of such license is non-de minimis with respect to the impacted asset, product line, operation or business. Analog Devices will also not be required to agree to or accept any obligation to permit any third party to invest (directly or indirectly, including through a joint venture or similar arrangement) in Analog Devices, Linear Technology, or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying completion of the Analog Acquisition or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the completion of the Analog Acquisition. In addition, neither we nor Analog Devices can provide assurance that any such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the Analog Acquisition.\nThe Analog Merger Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the Analog Acquisition and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire the Company.\nThe Analog Merger Agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for us to sell our business to a party other than Analog Devices. These provisions include a general prohibition on the Company soliciting any acquisition proposal or offer for a competing transaction. Further, there are only limited exceptions to (i) our agreement that our Board of Directors will not withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Analog Devices the recommendation of the our Board of Directors that our stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Analog Merger Agreement and (ii) our agreement not to enter into an agreement with respect to a company takeover proposal. In addition, we are required to pay Analog Devices a termination fee of $490 million if the Analog Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances relating to our entry into an agreement for an alternative transaction or a change in the recommendation of our Board of Directors with respect to the Analog Acquisition.\nThese provisions could discourage a third party that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of the Company from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if that party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share value than the value proposed to be received or realized in the Analog Acquisition. These provisions might also result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances.\nFailure to complete the Analog Acquisition could negatively affect our stock price and our future business and financial results.\nIf the Analog Acquisition is not completed for any reason, including as a result of our stockholders failing to approve the Analog Acquisition proposal, our ongoing business may be adversely affected, and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Analog Acquisition, we could be subject to a number of negative consequences, including the following:\n\u00b7\nwe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price;\n\u00b7\nwe may experience negative reactions from our customers and suppliers, or negative publicity generally;\n\u00b7\nwe may experience negative reactions from our employees and may not be able to retain key management personnel and other key employees;\n\u00b7\nwe will have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant non-recurring costs in connection with the Analog Acquisition that we may be unable to recover;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nthe Analog Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the Analog Acquisition, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of Analog Devices (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed in certain circumstances), which may prevent us from making certain acquisitions, taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the Analog Acquisition that may be beneficial to us if the Analog Acquisition were not to occur; and\n\u00b7\nmatters relating to the Analog Acquisition (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may be beneficial to us as an independent company.\nIn addition, upon termination of the Analog Merger Agreement, we are required to pay Analog Devices a termination fee of $490 million if the Analog Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances relating to our entry into an agreement for an alternative transaction or a change in the recommendation of our Board of Directors with respect to the Analog Acquisition. Finally, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Analog Acquisition or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Analog Merger Agreement. If the Analog Acquisition is not completed, any of these risks may materialize and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, financial results and stock price.\n\ufeff\nUncertainties associated with the Analog Acquisition may cause a loss of our management personnel and our other key employees, which could adversely affect our future business and operations or those of the combined company following the Analog Acquisition.\nWe are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our business plans. The combined company\u2019s success after the Analog Acquisition, or our success as a stand-alone company if the Analog Acquisition is not completed, will depend in part upon our ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees. Current and prospective employees of the Company may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the Analog Acquisition, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the Analog Acquisition. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that either we or the combined company will be able to retain our key management personnel and our other key employees.\n\ufeff\nLawsuits may in the future be filed against us or our directors challenging the Analog Acquisition, and an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent the Analog Acquisition from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.\nTransactions like the Analog Acquisition are frequently the subject to litigation or other legal proceedings, including actions alleging that our Board of Directors breached its fiduciary duty to our stockholders by entering into the Analog Merger Agreement, by failing to obtain a greater value in the transaction for our stockholders or otherwise. We believe that any such litigation or proceedings would be without merit, but there can be no assurance that they will not be brought. If litigation or other legal proceedings are in fact brought against us or our Board, we would defend against it vigorously, but we might not be successful in doing so. An adverse outcome in such matters, as well as the costs and efforts of a defense even if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition, including through the possible diversion of our resources or distraction of key personnel.\nFurther, one of the conditions to the completion of the Analog Acquisition is that no injunction by any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction be in effect that temporarily or permanently prohibits, enjoins or makes illegal the consummation of the Analog Acquisition. As such, if any of the plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Analog Acquisition, that injunction may prevent the Analog Acquisition from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\ufeff\nFluctuations in consumer and/or corporate spending, including due to uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment, could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\n\ufeff\nWe depend on demand from the industrial, communication, computer, consumer and transportation end-markets we serve. Our revenues and profitability are based on certain levels of consumer and corporate spending. Reductions or other fluctuations in consumer and/or corporate spending, including as a result of uncertain conditions in the macroeconomic environment, such as government economic or fiscal instability, restricted global credit conditions, reduced demand, imbalanced inventory levels, mortgage failures, fluctuations in interest rates, energy prices, currencies, or other conditions, could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. The impact of general economic sluggishness relating to government debt limits, unemployment issues and other causes can cause customers to be cautious, or delay or reduce orders for our products until these economic uncertainties improve.\n\ufeff\nSudden adverse shifts in the business cycle could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\n\ufeff\nThe semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may cause us to experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in our results of operations. The growth rate of the global economy is one of the factors affecting demand for semiconductor components. Many factors could adversely affect regional or global economic growth including turmoil or depressed conditions in financial or credit markets, depressed business or consumer confidence, inventory excesses, increased unemployment, inflation for goods, services or materials, volatility in oil pricing, fluctuations of the United States dollar, rising interest rates in the United States and the rest of the world, a significant act of terrorism which disrupts global trade or consumer confidence, geopolitical tensions including war and civil unrest, reduced levels of economic activity, or disruptions of international transportation.\n\ufeff\nTypically, our ability to meet our revenue and profitability goals and projections is dependent to a large extent on the orders we receive from our customers within the period and by our ability to match inventory and current production mix with the product mix required to fulfill orders on hand and orders received within a period for delivery in that period. Because of this complexity in our business, no assurance can be given that we will achieve a match of inventory on hand, production units, and shippable orders sufficient to realize quarterly or annual revenue and net income goals.\n\ufeff\nVolatility in customer demand in the semiconductor industry could affect future levels of revenue and profitability and limit our ability to predict such levels.\n\ufeff\nHistorically, we have maintained low lead times, which have enabled customers to place orders close to their true needs for product. In defining our financial goals and projections, we consider inventory on hand, backlog, production cycles and expected order patterns from customers. If our estimates in these areas are inaccurate, we may not be able to meet our revenue goals and projections. In addition, some customers require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even some, of the products. As a result, in any quarterly fiscal period we are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a fall-off of revenue and backlog. Further, those orders may be for products that meet the customer\u2019s unique requirements, such that those cancelled orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsalable products, and thus potential inventory write-offs. We routinely estimate inventory reserves required for such products, but actual results may differ from these reserve estimates.\n\ufeff\nWe generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide and our revenues are diversified by end-market and geographical region. Our results in any period, or sequence of periods, may be positively affected by the fact that a customer has designed one of our products into one of their high selling products. This positive effect may not last, however, as our customers frequently redesign their high selling products, especially to lower their products\u2019 costs. In such redesigns, they may decide to no longer use our product or may seek pricing terms from us that we choose not to accede to, thus resulting in the customer ceasing or significantly decreasing its purchases from us. In addition, the pendency of the Analog Acquisition could cause customers to fear, rightly or wrongly, that the combined company might not continue to offer those of our products that\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nare designed into their products and thus reduce their purchases of our products or consider redesign of their products, even before the Analog Acquisition is anticipated to close. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, purchases by a portion of our customer base, for these or other reasons, such as changes in purchasing practices, could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the timing of customers\u2019 inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products required to maintain or expand our business.\n\ufeff\nThe markets for our products depend on continued demand for our products in the communications, industrial, computer, high-end consumer and transportation end-markets. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, variations in manufacturing efficiencies of new products, and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development. New product offerings by competitors and customer demands for increasing linear integrated circuit performance or lower prices may render our products less competitive over time, thus necessitating our continual development of new products. New product introductions are thus a critical factor for maintaining or increasing future revenue growth and sustained or increased profitability, but they can present significant business challenges because product development commitments and expenditures must be made well in advance of the related revenues, in some cases years. The success of a new product depends on a variety of factors including accurate forecasts of long-term market demand and future technological developments, accurate anticipation of competitors\u2019 actions and offerings, timely and efficient completion of process design and development, timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes, product performance, quality and reliability of the product, and effective marketing, revenue and service.\nAlthough we believe that the high performance segment of the linear integrated circuit market is generally less affected by price erosion or by significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development than other semiconductor market sectors, future operating results may reflect substantial period-to-period fluctuations due to these or other factors.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, with respect to our acquisition of Dust Networks, we may not achieve benefits we expected to achieve, and we may incur write-downs, impairment charges or unforeseen liabilities that could negatively affect our operating results or financial position or could otherwise harm our business.\n\ufeff\nOur manufacturing operations may be interrupted or suffer yield problems.\n\ufeff\nWe rely on our internal manufacturing facilities located in California and Washington to fabricate most of our wafers. We depend on outside silicon foundries for a small portion (roughly 5%) of our wafer fabrication. We could be adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake, which could cause temporary loss of capacity, loss of raw materials, and damage to manufacturing equipment. Additionally, we rely on our internal and external assembly and testing facilities located in Singapore and Malaysia. We are subject to economic and political risks inherent to international operations, including changes in local governmental policies, currency fluctuations, transportation delays and the imposition of export controls or import tariffs. We could be adversely affected if any such changes are applicable to our foreign operations.\n\ufeff\nOur manufacturing yields are a function of product design and process technology, both of which are developed by us. The manufacture and design of integrated circuits is highly complex. We may experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of, among other things, capacity constraints, equipment malfunctioning, construction delays, upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies, any of which could result in a loss of future revenues or increases in fixed costs. To the extent we do not achieve acceptable manufacturing yields or there are delays in wafer fabrication, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, operating expenses related to increases in production capacity may adversely affect our operating results if revenues do not increase proportionately.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur dependence on third-party foundries and other manufacturing subcontractors may cause delays beyond our control in delivering our products to our customers.\n\ufeff\nA portion of our wafers (approximately 15%-20%) are processed offshore by independent assembly subcontractors primarily located in Thailand. These subcontractors separate wafers into individual circuits and assemble them into various finished package types. During periods of increasing demand and volatile lead times, sub-contractors can become over committed and therefore unable to meet all of their customer demand requirements thereby causing inconsistencies in availability of supply. In addition, reliability problems experienced by our assemblers could cause problems in delivery and quality, resulting in potential product liability to us. We could also be adversely affected by political disorders, labor disruptions, and natural disasters in these locations.\n\ufeff\nWe are dependent on outside silicon foundries for a small portion (roughly 5%) of our wafer fabrication. As a result, we cannot directly control delivery schedules for these products, which could lead to product shortages, quality assurance problems, increases in the cost of our products and delays in delivering our products to our customers. If these foundries are unable or unwilling to produce adequate supplies of processed wafers conforming to our quality standards, our business and relationships with our customers for the limited quantities of products produced by these foundries could be adversely affected. Finding alternate sources of supply or initiating internal wafer processing for these products may not be economically feasible. In addition, the manufacture of our products is a highly complex and precise process, requiring production in a highly controlled environment. Changes in manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective or contaminated materials by a third-party foundry could adversely affect the foundry\u2019s ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability.\n\ufeff\nWe rely on third-party vendors for materials, supplies, critical manufacturing equipment and freight services that may not have adequate capacity or may be impacted by outside influences such as natural disasters or material sourcing that could impact our product delivery requirements.\n\ufeff\nThe semiconductor industry has experienced a very large expansion of fabrication capacity and production worldwide over time. As a result of increasing demand from semiconductor and other manufacturers, availability of certain basic materials and supplies, such as chemicals, gases, polysilicon, silicon wafers, ultra-pure metals, lead frames and molding compounds, and subcontract services, like epitaxial growth, ion implantation and assembly of integrated circuits into packages, have from time to time, over the past several years, been in short supply and could come into short supply again if overall industry demand continues to increase in the future. In addition, from time to time natural disasters can lead to a shortage of some of the above materials due to disruption of the manufacturer\u2019s production. We do not have long-term agreements providing for all of these equipment, materials, supplies, and services, and shortages could occur as a result of capacity limitations or production constraints on suppliers that could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to achieve our planned production.\n\ufeff\nA number of our products use components that are purchased from third parties. Supplies of these components may not be sufficient to meet all customer requested delivery dates for products containing these components, which could adversely affect future revenue and earnings. Additionally, significant fluctuations in the purchase price for these components could affect gross margins for the products involved. Suppliers could also discontinue the manufacture of such purchased components or could have quality problems that could affect our ability to meet customer commitments.\n\ufeff\nOur manufacturing processes rely on critical manufacturing equipment purchased from third-party suppliers. During periods of increasing demand we could experience difficulties or delays in obtaining additional critical manufacturing equipment. In addition, suppliers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment are sometimes unable to deliver test and/or fabrication equipment to a schedule or equipment performance specification that meets our requirements. Delays in delivery of equipment needed for growth could adversely affect our ability to achieve our manufacturing and revenue plans in the future.\n\ufeff\nWe rely on third parties including freight forwarders, airlines, and ground transportation companies to deliver our products to customers. Interruptions in the ability of these third parties to deliver our products to customers due to geological events such volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, hurricanes or other such natural disasters may cause a temporary delay in meeting our shipping estimates and schedules.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nWe are exposed to business, economic, currency, political and other risks through our significant worldwide operations.\n\ufeff\nDuring fiscal year 2016, 72% of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets. In addition, we have test and assembly facilities in Singapore and Malaysia. Accordingly, we are subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international revenue and operations and their impact on the United States economy in general, including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world, economic disruption from financial and economic declines or turmoil, dysfunction in the credit markets, acts of terrorism, natural disasters or the response to any of the foregoing by the United States and other major countries.\n\ufeff\nChanges in currency exchange rates where the Company conducts business may impact it financially. As mentioned above, the Company\u2019s revenues and billings are transacted in U.S. dollars. Recently, the U.S. dollar has significantly strengthened against other currencies. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar results in the Company\u2019s products being more expensive for certain of its international customers. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s competitive position may be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen. The adverse effect to revenue may be partially offset in operating expenses since the Company generally incurs its foreign operating expenses, primarily labor, in the corresponding local currency.\n\ufeff\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may impact our ability to compete effectively.\n\ufeff\nOur success depends in part on our proprietary technology. While we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents, copyrights and trade secret protection, we believe that our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise, continuing our development of new products and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. However, we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances, or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently. We currently hold a number of United States and foreign patents and pending patent applications. However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the United States or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications. In addition, the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or provide no competitive advantages. Furthermore, effective patent, trademark, copyright, maskwork and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in certain foreign countries. We may incur significant legal costs to protect our intellectual property.\n\ufeff\nWe also seek to protect our proprietary technology, including technology that may not be patented or patentable, in part by confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, inventors\u2019 rights agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees and consultants. We cannot assure you that these agreements will always be entered into or will not be breached or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach.\n\ufeff\nWe have received, and may receive in the future, notices of claims of infringement and misappropriation of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. In the event of an adverse decision in a patent, trademark, copyright, maskwork or trade secret action, we could be required to withdraw the product or products found to be infringing from the market or redesign products offered for sale or under development. Whether or not these infringement claims are successfully asserted, we would likely incur significant costs and diversion of our resources with respect to the defense of these claims. In the event of an adverse outcome in any litigation, we may be required to pay substantial damages, including enhanced damages for willful infringement, and incur significant attorneys\u2019 fees, as well as indemnify customers for damages they might suffer if the products they purchase from us infringe intellectual property rights of others. We could also be required to stop our manufacture, use, sale or importation of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing technology, discontinue the use of some processes, or obtain licenses to intellectual property rights covering products and technology that we may, or have been found to, infringe or misappropriate such intellectual property rights.\n\ufeff\nOur products may contain defects that could affect our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur products may contain undetected errors or defects. Such problems may cause delays in product introductions and shipments, result in increased costs and diversion of development resources, cause us to incur increased charges due to obsolete\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nor unusable inventory, require design modifications, or decrease market acceptance or customer satisfaction with these products, which could result in loss of sales or product returns. In addition, we may not find defects or failures in our products until after commencement of commercial shipments, which may result in loss or delay in market acceptance that could significantly harm our operating results. Our current or potential customers also might seek to recover from us any losses resulting from defects or failures in our products; further, such claims might be significantly higher than the revenues and profits we receive from those of our products involved as we are usually a component supplier with limited value content relative to the value of a complete system or sub-system. In most cases we have contractual provisions in our customer contracts that seek to limit our liability to the replacement of the defective parts shipped. Nonetheless, liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages for which we may have insufficient insurance coverage. Any of these claims, whether or not successful, could seriously damage our reputation and business.\n\ufeff\nIf we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business may be harmed.\n\ufeff\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees. The loss of the services of key officers, technical personnel or other key employees could harm the business. Our success depends on our ability to identify, hire, train, develop and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. Failure to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel could harm us.\n\ufeff\nWe may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future.\n\ufeff\nWe compete in the high performance segment of the linear integrated circuit market. Our competitors include among others, Analog Devices, Intersil Corporation, Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. and Texas Instruments, Inc. Competition among manufacturers of linear integrated circuits is intense, and certain of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. The principal elements of competition include product performance, functional value, quality and reliability, technical service and support, price, diversity of product line and delivery capabilities. We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors, although we may be at a disadvantage in comparison to larger companies with broader product lines and greater technical service and support capabilities.\n\ufeff\nEnvironmental liabilities could force us to expend significant capital and incur substantial costs.\n\ufeff\nFederal, state and local regulations impose various environmental controls on the storage, use, discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in semiconductor processing. Our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations, and we believe that our activities conform to present environmental regulations. Increasing public attention has, however, been focused on the environmental impact of electronics manufacturing operations. While we to date have not experienced any materially adverse business effects from environmental regulations, there can be no assurance that changes in such regulations will not require us to acquire costly remediation equipment or to incur substantial expenses to comply with such regulations. Any failure by us to control the storage, use or disposal of, or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to significant liabilities.\n\ufeff\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by the ongoing drought in California, where we operate one of our wafer fabrication manufacturing facilities.\nWe rely on our internal manufacturing facilities located in California and Washington to fabricate most of our wafers. California is in its fifth year of drought and while the state government has eased the mandatory residential reduction in statewide water use in May 2016, both state and local governmental authorities will continue to enforce water use restrictions or impose new ones should drought conditions persist. In the future, this drought may impact businesses in the form of rate increases and/or mandatory reductions. Our fabrication process consumes a significant amount of water and we are generally dependent upon water provided by public utilities. We also maintain a well at the California facility; however, we may be restricted on the amount of water we can draw from that well. Restrictions on our access to water could have a significant adverse impact on our business as production at our California facility could be disrupted by the unavailability of water. In addition, we may be charged\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nmore for water or fined for deemed excessive usage which could impact our operating margins if we are not able to pass along price increases to our customers.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to a variety of domestic and international laws and regulations, including those relating to the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d, U.S. Customs and Export Regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\ufeff\nAs part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), the SEC has promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals (tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold), which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals. Certain of our products contain gold, tungsten and tin. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, we must annually publicly disclose whether we manufacture (as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act) any products that contain conflict minerals. Additionally, customers typically rely on us to provide critical data regarding the parts they purchase, including conflict mineral information. Our material sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered, and it is difficult to verify the origins for conflict minerals used in the products we sell. We have many suppliers, and each may provide conflict mineral information in a different manner, if at all. Accordingly, because the supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges from being unable to sufficiently verify the origins of conflict minerals used in our products. Additionally, customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of conflict minerals. This may limit the number of suppliers that can provide products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices.\n\ufeff\nAmong other laws and regulations, we are also subject to U.S. Customs and Export Regulations, including U.S. International Traffic and Arms Regulations and similar laws, which collectively control import, export and sale of technologies by companies and various other aspects of the operation of our business, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which prohibit companies from making improper payments to government officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies and procedures mandate compliance with such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees and agents will always act in strict compliance. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal enforcement, including monetary fines and possible injunctions against shipment of product or other activities, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by increased tax rates and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\n\ufeff\nAs a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of our worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment is required on our part to determine our worldwide tax liabilities. We have a partial tax holiday through July 2025 in Malaysia and a partial tax holiday in Singapore through August 2019. The ability to extend such tax holidays beyond their date of expiration cannot be assured. Our effective tax rate as well as the actual tax ultimately payable could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, in the valuation of deferred tax assets, in tax laws or by material audit assessments, which could affect our profitability. In addition, if we fail to meet certain conditions to the tax holidays, we may be liable for additional taxes and penalties. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability. Jurisdictions could change their tax regulations to include profits that were previously exempt.\n\ufeff\nWe have not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes on a portion of our undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. It is our intent to keep these funds permanently reinvested outside of the United States and current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations, but if in the future we decide to repatriate such foreign earnings to fund U.S. operations, we would incur incremental U.S. federal and state income taxes.\n\ufeff\nOur stock price may be volatile.\n\ufeff\nThe trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations. Our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as general United States and world economic and financial conditions, our own quarterly variations in operating results, announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, changes\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nin financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us, the hedging of our common stock and other derivative transactions by third parties, and new reports relating to trends in our markets or those of our customers. Additionally, lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees.\n\ufeff\nThe stock market in general, and prices for companies in our industry in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\n\ufeff\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws include anti-takeover provisions that may enable our management to resist an unwelcome takeover attempt by a third party.\n\ufeff\nOur organizational documents and Delaware law contain provisions that might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or a change in our management. Our Board of Directors may also choose to adopt further anti-takeover measures without stockholder approval. The existence and adoption of these provisions could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\n\ufeff\nA significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation.\n\ufeff\nWe rely on information technology systems throughout our organization to process and maintain financial records and employee and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, process and maintain personal data and other confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity, network communications and email. The information technology systems we use in our business may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. If we were to experience a disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business.\n\ufeff\nWe may also be subject to security breaches or other unauthorized access to, or misuse or acquisition of, personal data or other proprietary or confidential information caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, acts of vandalism by third parties, or intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or service providers. In addition, we provide our confidential and proprietary information to third-party business partners where necessary to conduct our business. While we employ confidentiality agreements to protect such information, those third parties may also suffer security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information. If any security breaches or unauthorized access to, or use or acquisition of, personal data or other confidential or proprietary information were to occur or believed to have occurred, our relationships with our business partners and customers could be materially damaged, our reputation and brand could be materially harmed, and governmental authorities or affected persons or entities could initiate enforcement actions, investigations, or other legal or regulatory action against us, which could cause us to incur significant fines, expenses and liability or could result in orders, judgments, or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 10299, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "LLTC"}
