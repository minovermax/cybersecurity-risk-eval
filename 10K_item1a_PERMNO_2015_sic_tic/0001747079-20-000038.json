{"cik": "1747079", "company": "Twin River Worldwide Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following Risk Factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our securities, including our common stock, could decline significantly, and investors could lose all or part of their investment.\nThe gaming industry is very competitive and increased competition, including through legislative legalization or expansion of gaming by states in or near where we own facilities or through Native American gaming facilities and internet gaming, could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe face significant competition in all of the areas in which we conduct our business. Increased competitive pressures may adversely affect our ability to continue to attract customers or affect our ability to compete efficiently.\nSeveral of the facilities where we conduct our business are located in jurisdictions that restrict gaming to certain areas and/or may be affected by state laws that currently prohibit or restrict gaming operations. We also face the risk that existing casino licensees will expand their operations and the risk that Native American gaming will continue to grow. Budgetary and other political pressures faced by state governments could lead to intensified efforts directed at the legalization of gaming in jurisdictions where it is currently prohibited. The legalization of gaming in such jurisdictions could be an expansion opportunity for our business, or create competitive pressures, depending on where the legalization occurs and our ability to capitalize on it. Our ability to attract customers to the existing casinos which we own could be significantly and adversely affected by the legalization or expansion of gaming in certain jurisdictions and by the development or expansion of Native American casinos in areas where our customers may visit.\nIn addition, our competitors may refurbish, rebrand or expand their casino offerings, which could result in increased competition. Furthermore, changes in ownership may result in improved quality of our competitors\u2019 facilities, which may make such facilities more competitive. Certain of our competitors are large gaming companies with greater name recognition and marketing and financial resources. In some instances, particularly in the case of Native American casinos, our competitors pay lower taxes or no taxes. These factors create additional challenges for us in competing for customers and accessing cash flow or financing to fund improvements for our casino and entertainment products that enable us to remain competitive.\nWe also compete with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as bingo, pull-tab games, card parlors, sports books, pari-mutuel or simulcast betting on horse and dog racing, state-sponsored lotteries, instant racing machines, VLTs (including racetracks that offer VLTs), and video poker terminals and, in the future, we may compete with gaming or entertainment at other venues. Further competition from internet lotteries and other internet wagering gaming services, which allow their customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play Las Vegas-style casino games from home, could divert customers from the facilities we own and thus adversely affect our business. Such internet wagering services are likely to expand in future years and become more accessible to domestic gamblers as a result of U.S. Department of Justice positions related to the application of federal laws to intrastate internet gaming and initiatives in some states to consider legislation to legalize intrastate internet wagering. The law in this area has been rapidly evolving, and additional legislative developments may occur at the federal and state levels that would accelerate the proliferation of certain forms of internet gaming in the United States.\nIn addition, in May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, a federal statute enacted to stop the spread of state-sponsored sports gambling. This decision has the effect of lifting federal restrictions on sports wagering and thus allows states to determine by themselves the legality of sports wagering. While new federal online gaming legislation has been introduced in Congress from time to time, there has been no federal legislative response to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\nAs a result, numerous states, including states we operate in currently in Rhode Island, Delaware, Mississippi and Colorado have passed legislation authorizing fixed-odds sports betting. Our Rhode Island, Delaware and Mississippi properties now offer sports wagering pursuant to state law in each case and the properties we have recently acquired in Black Hawk, Colorado will also offer sports wagering.\nWe may also face competition from other gaming facilities which are able to offer sports wagering services (including mobile sports wagering) following the enactment of applicable legislation. Numerous states that border the states in which we operate have pending or proposed legislation which would allow for sports betting, each of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur gaming operations (including our online wagering and sports gaming operations) rely heavily on technology services and software provided by third parties. In the event that there is an interruption of these services, it may have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nWe, or one of our state regulatory bodies, engage a number of third parties to provide gaming operating systems for the facilities we own. As a result, we rely on such third parties to provide uninterrupted services in order to run our business efficiently and effectively. In the event one of these third parties experiences a disruption in its ability to provide such services (whether due to technological or financial difficulties or power problems), this may result in a material disruption to the wagering activity at the casinos which we own and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAny unscheduled interruption in our technology services is likely to result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues due to a shutdown of our gaming operations, cloud computing and lottery systems. Such interruptions may occur as a result of, for example, catastrophic events or rolling blackouts. Our systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, telecommunication failures, hurricanes, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events.\nIncreased competition in our Rhode Island market, in particular, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nVarious competitive properties have opened and may be opening in the future that may affect our Twin River Casino Hotel in Rhode Island, and perhaps our Tiverton Casino Hotel in Rhode Island as well. In November 2011, the Expanded Gaming Act was signed into law in Massachusetts, which allowed up to three commercial destination resort casinos located in three geographically diverse regions across the state and a single slots facility for one location statewide. In February 2014, the MGC awarded the slots-only gaming license to Plainridge Park Casino in Plainville, Massachusetts which opened in June 2015. In the third quarter of 2018, MGM Resorts International opened the $1.0 billion Springfield resort casino in Springfield, Massachusetts, and Encore Boston Harbor opened in June 2019. We have taken various steps designed to increase our competitive position, including building a hotel adjacent to our Twin River Casino Hotel property in Lincoln, Rhode Island, near Providence, Rhode Island, constructing a new facility in Tiverton, Rhode Island and obtaining regulatory approvals for changes in gaming operations. There can be no assurance that these steps will be effective, or the ultimate effect of this additional competition. In addition, the Expanded Gaming Act allows the MGC at its discretion to award one additional commercial casino license, limited to the southeast region of the Commonwealth. The MGC has solicited public comment since late in 2018 on this issue as it continues to evaluate whether to issue such license. Finally, construction of a tribal casino in Taunton, Massachusetts is currently on hold following several rulings negating the validity of the tribe\u2019s land in trust taking. Further, a House bill has been introduced in Congress that would award the land in trust to the tribe and prevent any further litigation, including pending cases, with regard to its status. The outcome of challenges to the rulings and the likelihood of the proposed legislation is inherently uncertain.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending.\nConsumer demand for casinos and casino hotel properties, such as ours, is sensitive to downturns in the economy and the associated impact on discretionary consumer spending on leisure activities. Any adverse change in general economic conditions (including those that impact the stock market) can adversely affect consumer spending, which can adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from operations. Adverse developments affecting economies throughout the world including a general tightening of the availability of credit, increasing energy costs, rising prices, inflation, acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters, declining consumer confidence, significant declines in the stock market or epidemics, pandemics or other health-related events or widespread illnesses, like the ongoing outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, could lead to a reduction in visitors to our properties, including those that stay in our hotels, or discretionary spending by our customers on entertainment and leisure activities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecessions have affected our business and financial condition, and economic conditions may continue to affect them in ways that currently cannot accurately be predicted.\nEconomic recessions have had, and may continue to have, far reaching adverse consequences across many industries, including the gaming industry, which may adversely affect our business and financial condition. In the past decade, the U.S. economy has experienced periods of weakness and recession following a financial crisis, which resulted in increased unemployment, decreased consumer spending and a decline in housing values. Presently, the ongoing outbreak of the COVID-19 virus threatens the return of a recessionary environment that, should it occur and continue, could materially and adversely impact our business. Moreover, we rely on the strength of regional and local economies for the performance of each of our properties. If the national economy experiences another recession or any of the relevant regional or local economies suffers a downturn, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance and self-insurance programs may not be adequate to cover future claims.\nWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liabilities, including employee healthcare benefits, up to certain stop-loss amounts which limit our exposure above the amounts we have self-insured. We estimate the liabilities and required reserves associated with the risks we retain. Any such estimates and actuarial projection of losses is subject to a considerable degree of variability. A considerable increase in claims as a result of a pandemic including COVID-19, should they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If actual losses incurred are greater than those anticipated, our reserves may be insufficient and additional costs could be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. If we suffer a substantial loss that exceeds our self-insurance reserves, and any excess insurance coverage, the loss and attendant expenses could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive state and local regulation and licensing, and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur ownership and operation of casino gaming and horse racing facilities and online offerings are subject to extensive state and local regulation, and regulatory authorities at the state and local levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of these businesses, and may revoke, suspend, condition, fail to renew or limit our gaming or other licenses, impose substantial fines and take other actions, each of which poses a significant risk to our business, results of operations and financial condition. We currently hold all state and local licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our present operations, but must periodically apply to renew many of these licenses and registrations and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees renewed. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such renewals or that we will be able to obtain future approvals that would allow us to expand our gaming operations. Any failure to maintain or renew existing licenses, registrations, permits or approvals would have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, if additional gaming laws or regulations are adopted in jurisdictions where we operate, these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us.\nAny of the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation and the Division of Lotteries of the Rhode Island Department of Revenue, the Mississippi Gaming Commission, the Delaware Gaming Commission, the Colorado Department of Revenue, Division of Gaming or the Colorado Racing Commission may, in their discretion, require certain holders of any securities issued by us to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own our securities if it has reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of its respective state. The Rhode Island regulatory authorities limit the ability of third parties to acquire (1) 5% or more of our common stock, unless the shareholder has been granted a gaming license or the ownership is otherwise approved by the Rhode Island regulatory authorities, (2) 20% or more of our outstanding common stock, unless the acquiring shareholder has been granted a gaming license by the Rhode Island regulatory authorities or such ownership is otherwise approved or (3) as to passive institutional investors, generally 15% or more of our common stock, but in all cases the amount approved by the Rhode Island regulatory authorities with respect to that investor.\nThe Delaware regulatory authorities limit the ability of third parties to acquire 10% or more of our common stock, or, as to passive institutional investors, up to 15% of our common stock, unless the acquiring shareholder has been granted a license by the Delaware regulatory authorities or such ownership is otherwise approved. The Delaware regulatory authorities have adopted regulations substantially similar to those in effect in Rhode Island permitting a waiver for institutional shareholders who own up to 15% of a regulated company. The Colorado regulatory authorities limit the ability of third parties to acquire (1) 5% or more of our common stock, unless the shareholder has provided notice to the Colorado regulatory authorities of such holdings and comply with any further requirements, (2) 10% or more of our common stock, unless the shareholder has been found suitable by the Colorado regulatory authorities or been deemed a passive institutional investor, or (3) 20% or more of our common stock, unless the shareholder has been found suitable by the Colorado regulatory authorities. The costs of any investigation conducted by any of these or other gaming authorities under these circumstances must be paid by the applicant, and refusal or failure to pay these charges may constitute grounds for a finding that the applicant is unsuitable to own the securities. If any of the gaming authorities with regulatory oversight over our operations determines that a person is unsuitable to own our securities, then, under the applicable gaming or horse racing laws and regulations, we could be sanctioned, including the loss of approvals, if, without the prior approval of the applicable gaming authority, we conduct certain business with the unsuitable person.\nOur officers, directors and key employees are also subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we manage gaming facilities. If any applicable gaming authority were to find any of our officers, directors, or key employees unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. Furthermore, the applicable gaming authority may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Either result could adversely affect our gaming operations.\nApplicable gaming laws and regulations may restrict our ability to issue certain securities, incur debt and undertake other financing activities. Such transactions would generally require notice and/or approval of applicable gaming authorities, and our financing counterparties, including lenders, might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we manage gaming facilities. Applicable gaming laws further limit our ability to engage in certain competitive activities and impose requirements relating to the composition of our board of directors and senior management personnel. If state regulatory authorities were to find any person unsuitable with regard to his, her or its relationship to us or any of our subsidiaries, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to numerous other federal, state and local laws that may expose us to liabilities or have a significant adverse impact on our operations. Changes to any such laws could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to a variety of other federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Changes to any of the laws, rules, regulations or ordinances to which we are subject, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nMany of our employees, especially those that interact with our customers, receive a base salary or wage that is established by applicable state and federal laws that establish a minimum hourly wage that is, in turn, supplemented through tips and gratuities from customers. From time to time, state and federal lawmakers have increased the minimum wage. It is difficult to predict when such increases may take place. Any such change to the minimum wage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe sale of alcoholic beverages is a highly regulated and taxed business. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the production and distribution of alcoholic beverages, including permitting, licensing, trade practices, labeling, advertising, marketing, distributor relationships and related matters. Federal, state and local governmental entities also levy various taxes, license fees, and other similar charges and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations could result in higher taxes, penalties, fees, and suspension or revocation of permits, licenses or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. From time to time, local and state lawmakers, as well as special interest groups, have proposed legislation that would increase the federal and/or state excise tax on alcoholic beverages or certain types of alcoholic beverages. If federal or state excise taxes are increased, we may have to raise prices to maintain our current profit margins. Higher taxes may reduce overall demand for alcoholic beverages, thus negatively impacting sales of our alcoholic beverages at our properties. Further federal or state regulation may be forthcoming that could further restrict the distribution and sale of alcohol products. Any material increases in taxes or fees, or the adoption of additional taxes, fees or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, each restaurant we operate must obtain a food service license from local authorities. Failure to comply with such regulations could cause our licenses to be revoked or our related restaurant business or businesses to be forced to cease operations. Moreover, state liquor laws may prevent the expansion of restaurant operations into certain markets.\nAny violation of applicable anti-money laundering laws or regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe handle significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Recently, U.S. governmental authorities have evidenced an increased focus on compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations in the gaming industry. Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Internal control policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in prohibiting our employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the law. If we or our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or our policies governing our operations, we may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. Any such government investigations, prosecutions or other legal proceedings or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFailure to comply with the terms of the Regulatory Agreement could result in a breach and could harm our business.\nWe are currently a party to the Regulatory Agreement with Rhode Island regulatory agencies. The Regulatory Agreement imposes certain affirmative and negative covenants on us. For more detail on the Regulatory Agreement see the section entitled \u201cGovernmental Regulation\u201d in \u201cItem I. Business.\u201d A failure to comply with the provisions in the Regulatory Agreement could subject us to injunctive or monetary relief, payments to the Rhode Island regulatory agencies and ultimately the revocation or suspension of our licenses to operate in Rhode Island. Any such remedy could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Among other things, the Regulatory Agreement prohibits us and our subsidiaries from owning, operating, managing or providing gaming specific goods and services to any gaming facilities in Rhode Island (other than Twin River Casino Hotel and Tiverton Casino Hotel), Massachusetts, Connecticut or New Hampshire, which may adversely affect our growth and market opportunity in those states.\nOur VLTs and table games hold percentages may fluctuate.\nThe gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance and our casino guests\u2019 winnings depend on a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the element of chance, hold percentages are affected by other factors, including players\u2019 skill and experience, the mix of games played, the financial resources of players, the volume of bets placed and the amount of time played. The variability of our hold percentages has the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe conduct our business in an industry that is subject to high taxes and may be subject to higher taxes in the future.\nIn gaming jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, with the exception of Rhode Island, state and local governments raise considerable revenues from taxes based on casino revenues and operations. In Rhode Island, the state takes all of the gaming win that comes into our Rhode Island operations and then pays us a percentage of the gaming win. We also pay property taxes, occupancy taxes, sales and use taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and income taxes. Our profitability will depend on generating enough revenues to cover variable expenses, such as payroll and marketing, as well as largely fixed expenses, such as property taxes and interest expense. From time to time, state and local governments have increased gaming taxes and such increases could significantly impact the profitability of our gaming operations.\nOur operations in Delaware, Colorado and Mississippi are generally subject to significant revenue-based taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. In addition, from time to time, federal, state and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. Further, worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of Delaware, Colorado and Mississippi and applicable local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes and/or property taxes. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws in these jurisdictions or in the administration of such laws. Such changes, if adopted, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes and/or property taxes and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts. Any material increase, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, could adversely affect our future financial results.\nThere can be no assurance that governments in jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, or the federal government, will not enact legislation that increases gaming tax rates. General economic pressures have the potential to reduce revenues of state governments from traditional tax sources, which may cause state legislatures or the federal government to be more inclined to increase gaming tax rates.\nWe are subject to risks associated with labor relations, labor costs and labor disruptions.\nWe are subject to the costs and risks generally associated with labor disputes and organizing activities related to unionized labor. From time to time, our operations may be disrupted by strikes, public demonstrations or other coordinated actions and publicity. We may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contractual disputes, negotiations or other labor-related disruptions. We have collective bargaining agreements applicable to approximately 36% of our employees as of December 31, 2019. We have 13 collective bargaining agreements with terms ranging between three to five years generally. These agreements are based solely in Rhode Island. We may also face organizing activities that could result in additional employees becoming unionized. Furthermore, collective bargaining agreements may limit our ability to reduce the size of our workforce during an economic downturn, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur obligation to fund multi-employer defined benefit plans and the Dover Downs Pension Plan to which we are a party, may adversely affect us.\nWe must contribute to a number of multi-employer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover certain union-represented employees. The risks of participating in these multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:\n\u2022\nassets contributed to the multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers;\n\u2022\nif a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers; and\n\u2022\nif we choose to stop participating in some of our multi-employer plans, we may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.\nIn addition, the funding obligations for our pension plans will be impacted by the performance of the financial markets, particularly the equity markets, and interest rates. Funding obligations are determined by government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date. If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected, we could be required to make larger contributions. The equity markets can be very volatile, and in the first quarter of 2020 have displayed meaningful volatility and, therefore, our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements. An adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity.\nThe casino, hotel and hospitality industry is capital intensive and we may not be able to finance development, expansion and renovation projects, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur casino and hotel properties have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements to remain competitive, including room refurbishments, amenity upgrades, and replacement, from time to time, of furniture, fixtures and equipment. We may also need to make capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Construction projects entail significant risks, which can substantially increase costs or delay completion of a project. Such risks include shortages of materials or skilled labor, unforeseen engineering, environmental or geological problems, work stoppages, weather interference and unanticipated cost increases. Most of these factors are beyond our control. In addition, difficulties or delays in obtaining any of the requisite licenses, permits or authorizations from regulatory authorities can increase the cost or delay the completion of an expansion or development. Significant budget overruns or delays with respect to expansion and development projects could adversely affect our business, and our results of operations.\nRenovations and other capital improvements of casino properties in particular require significant capital expenditures. In addition, any such renovations and capital improvements usually generate little or no cash flow until the projects are completed. We may not be able to fund such projects solely from cash provided from operating activities. Consequently, we may have to rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital to fund renovations and capital improvements, and our ability to carry them out will be limited if we cannot obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing, which will depend on, among other things, market conditions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to renovate and maintain gaming and entertainment venues from time to time may put us at a competitive disadvantage to gaming and entertainment venues offering more modern and better maintained facilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nBecause we are heavily dependent upon hotel/casino and related operations that are conducted in certain limited regions, we are subject to greater risks than a company that is geographically or otherwise more diversified.\nWe are heavily dependent upon hotel/casino and related operations that are conducted in Rhode Island, Mississippi, Colorado and Delaware for all of our cash flow. As a result, we are subject to a greater degree of risk than a gaming company that has greater geographical diversity. The risks to which we may have a greater degree of exposure include the following:\n\u2022\nlocal economic and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\ninaccessibility due to weather conditions, road construction or closure of primary access routes;\n\u2022\nchanges in local and state governmental laws and regulations, including gaming laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nnatural and other disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes and flooding;\n\u2022\na decline in the number of residents in or near, or visitors to, our operations;\n\u2022\nan increase in gaming activities in neighboring jurisdictions; and\n\u2022\na decrease in gaming activities at any of our facilities.\nAny of the factors outlined above could adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions, including our Merger with Dover Downs.\nWe cannot assure you that our recently completed acquisition of the Black Hawk Casinos, or any future acquisitions, such as our pending acquisition of properties in Vicksburg, Mississippi and Kansas City, Missouri, will enhance our financial performance. Our ability to achieve the expected benefits of any acquisitions will depend on, among other things, our ability to effectively translate our strategies (including our planned renovation of the property we are acquiring in Kansas City) into revenue, our ability to retain and assimilate the acquired businesses\u2019 employees, our ability to retain existing customers and suppliers on terms similar to, or better than, those in place with the acquired businesses, our ability to attract new customers, the adequacy of our implementation plans, our ability to maintain our financial and internal controls and systems as we expand our operations, the ability of our management to oversee and operate effectively the combined operations and our ability to achieve desired operating efficiencies and revenue goals. The integration of the businesses that we acquire might also cause us to incur costs that are unforeseen or that exceed our estimates, which would lower our future earnings and would prevent us from realizing the expected benefits of such acquisitions. Our recent acquisition of the Black Hawk Casinos and our pending acquisition of two properties from Eldorado Resorts each involve acquiring properties from larger parent companies and will require the provision of transition services from the seller for a period of time as we work to separate the properties from their parent companies. In some cases, the services provided by the sellers are critical to the ongoing efficient operation of the properties and may involve costly payments from us to the provider of the services. If the provision of these services by the sellers is disrupted or given insufficient attention by the sellers, our ability to operate the properties may be negatively impacted until such time as we are able to take full control over the services. Moreover, we must pay the sellers for these services and the costs to us for these services may exceed our estimates and these expenses will negatively impact the results of operations of these properties during these transition periods. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions could result in decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results including, ultimately, a reduction in our stock price.\nWe face risks associated with growth and acquisitions.\nAs part of our business strategy, we regularly evaluate opportunities for growth through development of gaming operations in existing or new markets, through acquiring other gaming entertainment facilities or through redeveloping our existing gaming facilities. In the future, we may also pursue expansion opportunities, including joint ventures or partnerships, in jurisdictions where casino gaming is not currently permitted in order to be prepared to develop projects upon approval of casino gaming.\nAlthough we only intend to engage in acquisitions that, if consummated, will be accretive to us and our shareholders, acquisitions require significant management attention and resources to integrate new properties, businesses and operations. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses with our businesses. The combination of two independent companies is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process. This process may disrupt the business of either or both of the companies and may not result in the full benefits expected. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process that may negatively impact our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results include, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nthe inability to successfully incorporate the assets in a manner that permits us to achieve the full revenue increases, cost reductions and other benefits anticipated to result from any acquisitions;\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing the combined business, including difficulty addressing possible differences in cultures and management philosophies and the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks and other assets of each of the companies in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies;\n\u2022\nthe disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each of our ongoing businesses;\n\u2022\ninconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies; and\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses associated with acquisitions.\nAdditionally, even if integration is successful, the overall integration of acquired assets and businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer and other business relationships and diversion of management attention. There is also no guarantee that the acquired assets or businesses will generate any of the projected synergies and earnings growth, and the failure to realize such projected synergies and earnings growth may adversely affect our operating and financial results and derail any growth plans.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire, develop or profitably manage additional companies or operations or successfully integrate such companies or operations into our existing operations without substantial costs, delays or other problems. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we will receive gaming or other necessary licenses or approvals for new projects that we may pursue or that gaming will be approved in jurisdictions where it is not currently approved.\nBallot measures or other voter-approved initiatives to allow gaming in jurisdictions where gaming, or certain types of gaming (such as slots and sports wagering), was not previously permitted could be challenged, and, if such challenges are successful, these ballot measures or initiatives could be invalidated. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that there will not be similar or other challenges to legalized gaming in existing or current markets in which we may operate or have development plans, and successful challenges to legalized gaming could require us to abandon or substantially curtail our operations or development plans in those locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not face similar challenges and difficulties with respect to new development projects or expansion efforts that we may undertake, which could result in significant sunk costs that we may not be able to fully recoup or that otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all. To the extent that we seek to acquire other businesses in exchange for our common stock, fluctuations in our stock price could adversely affect our ability to complete acquisitions.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, or new business strategies.\nWe have invested in, formed strategic alliances with, and announced proposed joint ventures with other companies, including a proposed joint venture with International Game Technology, PLC (\u201cIGT\u201d) in Rhode Island (the \u201cJoint Venture\u201d), and we may expand those relationships or enter into similar relationships with additional companies which may require various state approvals which may or may not be granted. These initiatives are typically complex and we may not be able to complete anticipated alliance or joint venture transactions, the anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be realized, or the benefits may be delayed. For example, we may not successfully integrate an alliance or joint venture with our operations, including the implementation of our controls, systems, procedures, and policies, or unforeseen expenses or liabilities may arise that were not discovered during due diligence prior to an investment or entry into a strategic alliance, or a misalignment of interests may develop between us and the other party. Further, to the extent we share ownership, control, or management with another party in a joint venture, our ability to influence the joint venture may be limited, and we may be unable to prevent misconduct or implement our compliance or internal control systems. In addition, implementation of a new business strategy may lead to the disruption of our existing business operations, including distracting management from current operations. Results of operations from new activities may be lower than our existing activities, and, if a strategy is unsuccessful, we may not recoup our investments in that strategy. Failure to successfully and timely realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions or strategies could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWith respect to the proposed Joint Venture, any material unanticipated issues arising from the integration process could negatively impact our stock price, future business and financial results. Moreover, uncertainty about the effect of the proposed transaction on employees, customers, suppliers, distributors and other business partners may have an adverse effect on us and the Joint Venture. These uncertainties may impair our and/or the Joint Venture\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel to execute the Joint Venture\u2019s strategy, and could cause customers, suppliers, distributors and others who deal with us and/or the Joint Venture to seek to change or cancel existing business relationships with us and/or the Joint Venture or fail to renew existing relationships.\nThe Joint Venture will be subject to the risks associated with the Company\u2019s gaming business, approvals by the state of Rhode Island, in addition to the risks associated with IGT\u2019s machine gaming business, and the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Joint Venture may be affected by factors that are different from or in addition to those currently affecting the independent business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company\u2019s gaming business. Many of these factors are outside of our and the Joint Venture\u2019s control, and could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Joint Venture. Moreover, although we will have certain consent, board representation and other governance rights with respect to the joint venture, the Company will be a minority owner of the Joint Venture. As a result, we will not have control over the Joint Venture, its management or its policies and we may have business interests, strategies and goals that differ in certain respects from those of IGT or the Joint Venture.\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets.\nWe monitor the recoverability of our long-lived assets, such as buildings, and evaluate their carrying value for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. We annually review goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred. Additionally, interim reviews are performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the long-lived assets or the carrying value and fair value of the reporting unit, in the period the determination is made. The testing of long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment requires us to make estimates that are subject to significant assumptions about our future revenue, profitability, cash flows, fair value of assets and liabilities, weighted average cost of capital, as well as other assumptions. Changes in these estimates, or changes in actual performance compared with these estimates, may affect the fair value of long-lived assets or reporting unit, which may result in an impairment charge.\nWe cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of long-lived assets or goodwill become impaired, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur debt agreements and regulatory agreement contain restrictive covenants that may limit our operating flexibility.\nOur current credit facility and regulatory agreement includes, and our future debt agreements and regulatory agreements will likely include, numerous financial and other covenants, imposing financial and operating restrictions on our business. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions and other events beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with these covenants. The failure to comply with a financial covenant or other restrictions contained in the agreements governing such indebtedness or our regulatory agreement, may result in an event of default under the credit agreement or sanctions or fines under the regulatory agreement. An event of default under our credit facility could result in acceleration of some or all of the applicable indebtedness as well as other indebtedness of ours and the inability to borrow additional funds. We do not have, and cannot be certain we would be able to obtain, sufficient funds to repay any such indebtedness if it is accelerated. Restrictions in our debt agreements or our regulatory agreements might affect our ability to operate our business, might limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise and might adversely affect the conduct of our current business, including by restricting our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and limiting our ability to engage in other business activities.\nOur existing and future indebtedness may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $698.5 million of total indebtedness outstanding consisting of $298.5 million outstanding under our term loan facility (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d or \u201cTerm Loan\u201d) pursuant to the terms of a credit agreement the Company entered into on May 10, 2019 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with Citizens Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the \u201cAgent\u201d), and the lenders party thereto, and $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 6.75% senior notes due 2027 (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d). As of December 31, 2019, we also were a party to a $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d or \u201cRevolver\u201d and together with the Term Loan, the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d), of which there were no borrowings as of that date. This indebtedness may have important negative consequences for us, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to satisfy obligations;\n\u2022\nincreasing vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we conduct business;\n\u2022\nincreasing vulnerability to, and limiting our ability to react to, changing market conditions, changes in industry and economic downturns;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service, general corporate or other obligations;\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends and distributions, make acquisitions and dispositions, borrow additional funds and make capital expenditures and other investments;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a significant portion of these funds to make principal and/or interest payments on outstanding debt;\n\u2022\nexposing us to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on borrowings under our Credit Facility;\n\u2022\ncausing our failure to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants contained in our current or future indebtedness, which could cause a default under that indebtedness (and other indebtedness of ours) and which, if not cured or waived, could adversely affect us; and\n\u2022\naffecting our ability to renew gaming and other licenses necessary to conduct our business.\nThough we have significant amounts of indebtedness outstanding, we have the ability to borrow the entire $250.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility and may issue or incur additional indebtedness to fund our operations, including as necessary to execute on our growth strategy. Further, we may incur other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. The risks that we face based on our outstanding indebtedness may intensify if we incur additional indebtedness or financing obligations in the future.\nServicing our indebtedness and funding our other obligations requires a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which will be beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations and capital expenditures depends upon our ability to generate cash flow and secure financing in the future. Our ability to generate future cash flow depends, among other things, upon:\n\u2022\nour future operating performance;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\ncompetition;\n\u2022\nlegislative and regulatory factors affecting our operations and businesses; and\n\u2022\nour future operating performance.\nSome of these factors will be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. The inability to generate cash flow could result in us needing to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, including through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities. If needed, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could adversely affect our financial condition.\nA market downturn may negatively impact our access to financing.\nSince emergence from a recession over ten years ago, the U.S. economy has been expanding at various growth rates. Such growth could slow, or reverse, and another economic downturn could occur, including as a result of the ongoing outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. A downturn in the financial markets or market volatility (like those now being experienced) could negatively impact our ability to access capital and financing (including financing necessary for acquisitions or to refinance our existing indebtedness) on acceptable terms and prices, that we would otherwise need in connection with the operation of our business.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly.\nThere have been and are periods of time when the U.S. securities markets have experienced significant price fluctuations. These price fluctuations may be day-to-day or they may last for extended periods of time. Significant price fluctuations in the securities markets as a whole have caused, and may continue to cause, the market price of our common stock to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. The trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Additional factors that could cause fluctuations in, or adversely affect, our stock price or trading volume include:\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions, including market conditions in the gaming and hotel industries;\n\u2022\nactual or expected variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\ndifferences between actual operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by current shareholders seeking liquidity in the public market;\n\u2022\nchanges in recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\noperations and stock performance of competitors;\n\u2022\naccounting charges, including charges relating to the impairment of goodwill;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or by competitors;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by our directors and officers or significant investors; and\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel.\nThere can be no assurance that the stock price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to our performance.\nOur largest shareholder owns a meaningful percentage of our outstanding common stock, which could limit the ability of other shareholders to influence corporate matters.\nOur largest shareholder beneficially owned 37.1% of our outstanding common stock as of February 20, 2020. As a result, this shareholder, who is also our chairman, may be able to exert influence over our affairs and policies. This concentrated ownership could limit the ability of the remaining shareholders to influence corporate matters, and the interests of the large shareholder may not coincide with our interests or the interests of the remaining shareholders. The concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock.\nIn June 2019, we commenced the payment of a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our earnings, cash requirements, financial condition, requirements to comply with the covenants under our debt instruments and the Regulatory Agreement, legal considerations, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. A reduction in the amount of cash dividends on our common stock, the suspension of those dividends, or a failure to meet market expectations regarding potential dividend increases could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. If we do not pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future, then the return on an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon our future stock price. There is no guarantee that our common stock will maintain its value or appreciate in value.\nWe are a holding company and will depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments.\nWe are structured as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries. Our only significant asset is the capital stock or other equity interests of our operating subsidiaries. As a holding company, we will conduct all of our business through our subsidiaries. Consequently, our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends, will be dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries. If our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments or distributions to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, we may not be able to pay dividends. In addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors.\nWe are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our business and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we are named in lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to our businesses. In particular, the nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers, past and present employees, shareholders, competitors, business partners and others in the ordinary course of business. As with all legal proceedings, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of these matters. Moreover, legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming, and we may not be successful in defending or prosecuting these lawsuits, which could result in settlements or damages that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water, as well as the management and disposal of solid, animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials. These laws and regulations, which are complex and subject to change, include United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations. In addition, our horse racing facility in Colorado is subject to state laws and regulations that address the impacts of manure and wastewater generated by Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (\u201cCAFO\u201d) on water quality, including, but not limited to, storm water discharges. CAFO regulations include permit requirements and water quality discharge standards. Enforcement of CAFO regulations has been receiving increased governmental attention. Compliance with these and other environmental laws can, in some circumstances, require significant capital expenditures. For example, we may incur future costs under existing and new laws and regulations pertaining to storm water and wastewater management at our racetracks. Moreover, violations can result in significant penalties and, in some instances, interruption or cessation of operations.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of regulated materials into the environment. Certain of these laws and regulations impose strict, and under certain circumstances joint and several, liability on a current or previous owner or operator of property for the costs of remediating regulated materials on or emanating from our property. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial. The presence of, or failure to remediate properly, such materials may adversely affect the ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow funds using such property as collateral. Additionally, as an owner or manager of real property, we could be subject to claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination at or emanating from third party sites. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or manager knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants and the liability under those laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of the responsibility. In addition, environmental requirements address the impacts of development on wetlands.\nThe possibility exists that contamination, as yet unknown, may exist on our properties. There can be no assurance that we will not incur expenditures for environmental investigations or remediation in the future.\nWe are largely dependent on the skill and experience of management and key personnel.\nWe expect to experience strong competition in hiring and retaining qualified property and corporate management personnel, including competition from Native American gaming facilities that are not subject to the same taxation regimes as we are and therefore may be willing and able to pay higher rates of compensation. From time to time, a number of vacancies in key corporate and property management positions can be expected. If we are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified management personnel at our facilities or at the corporate level, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our officers, directors and key employees are required to file applications with the gaming authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and are required to be licensed or found suitable by these gaming authorities. If the gaming authorities were to find an officer, director or key employee unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. Furthermore, the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Either result could significantly impair our operations. The time and effort needed to successfully complete the application process could impact our ability to attract, hire and retain top talent.\nAs an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of reduced governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could result in our common stock being less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, our stock price may be more volatile and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company, which in certain circumstances could be for up to five years. We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (1) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (2) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would occur if the market value of our shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three-year period and (4) the last day of our fiscal year containing the fifth anniversary of the date on which we first sold common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement, or December 31, 2024.\nAs a public company we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting and any failure to do so may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to furnish an annual report by management on, among other things, our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. We also are required to disclose significant changes made in our internal control procedures on a quarterly basis. The process of designing, implementing and testing internal controls over financial reporting is time consuming, costly and complicated. However, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of the exemption permitting us to avoid the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement.\nIf we are unable to successfully remediate any future deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or if we identify any additional deficiencies or weaknesses, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting could be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and/or our stock price may decline as a result.\nOur business may be harmed from cyber security incidents and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss, disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our guests\u2019, business partners\u2019 or our own information or other breaches of information security.\nWe make extensive use of online services and centralized data processing, including through third party service providers. We have experienced cyber-attacks, attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents. The secure maintenance and transmission of customer information is a critical element of our operations. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit guest information, or those of service providers, business partners or employee information may be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security, or that of a third party service provider or business partner, or impacted by intentional or unintentional actions or inactions by our employees, or those of a third party service provider or business partner. As a result, our guests\u2019 information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without our guests\u2019 consent.\nIn addition, third party service providers and other business partners process and maintain proprietary business information and data related to our employees, guests, suppliers and other business partners. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit this information, or those of service providers or business partners, may also be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security or that of a third party service provider or business partner, or impacted by intentional or unintentional actions or inactions by our employees or those of a third party-service provider or business partner. As a result, our business information, guest, supplier and other business partner data may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without consent.\nAny such loss, disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to, guests\u2019 or business partners\u2019 information or other breach of our information security can result in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, may have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, the loss, disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may adversely affect our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks relating to mechanical failure.\nAll of our facilities are subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time, as the result of casualty, forces of nature, mechanical failure, or extended or extraordinary maintenance, among other causes. In addition, our gaming operations could be damaged or halted due to extreme weather conditions. These risks are particularly pronounced at our Hard Rock Biloxi property because of its location adjacent to water and the potential for hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.\nOur operations have historically been subject to seasonal variations and quarterly fluctuations in operating results, and we can expect to experience such variations and fluctuations in the future.\nHistorically, our gaming facilities have typically been subject to seasonal variations.\nIn the Rhode Island market, excessive snowfall during the winter months can make travel to Rhode Island casinos more difficult. This often results in significant declines in traffic on major highways and causes a decline in customer volume. Furthermore, management believes that substantially all visitors to the Rhode Island casinos arrive by some form of ground transportation. Therefore, even normal winter weather may cause revenues and cash flows for our Rhode Island and Delaware operations to be adversely affected. Our recently acquired Black Hawk Casinos are subject to similar risks.\nWe may incur property and other losses that are not adequately covered by insurance.\nAlthough we maintain insurance that we believe is customary and appropriate for our business, we cannot assure you that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all losses and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected. The lack of adequate insurance for certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are uninsured or underinsured. Any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to find replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payments of our obligations. We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits, further increase our deductibles, or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by the occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, or other catastrophic events, including war and terrorism.\nNatural disasters, such as major hurricanes, typhoons, floods, fires and earthquakes, could adversely affect our business and operating results. Hurricanes are common in the areas in which our Mississippi property is located, and the severity of such natural disasters is unpredictable.\nFor example, in 2005, prior to our ownership, Hurricane Katrina destroyed the Hard Rock Biloxi before its opening and the property had to be rebuilt. In 2017, customer traffic to the Hard Rock Biloxi was negatively impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Nate.\nCatastrophic events, such as terrorist attacks in the United States and elsewhere, have had a negative effect on travel and leisure expenditures, including lodging, gaming (in some jurisdictions) and tourism. We cannot accurately predict the extent to which such events may affect us, directly or indirectly, in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or choose to purchase any insurance coverage with respect to occurrences of terrorist acts and any losses that could result from these acts. If there is a prolonged disruption at our facilities due to natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to obtain business interruption coverage for casualties resulting from severe weather such as hurricanes, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain casualty insurance coverage at affordable rates, if at all, for casualties resulting from severe weather.", "PERMNO": 18425, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "TRWH"}
