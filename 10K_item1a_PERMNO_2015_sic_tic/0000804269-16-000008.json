{"cik": "804269", "company": "General Motors Financial Company, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-03", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe profitability and financial condition of our operations are dependent upon the operations of our parent, GM.\nA material portion of our retail finance business, and substantially all our commercial lending activities, consist of financing associated with the sale and lease of new GM vehicles and our relationship with GM-franchised dealerships. If there were significant changes in GM's liquidity and capital position and access to the capital markets, the production or sales of GM vehicles to retail customers, the quality or resale value of GM vehicles, or other factors impacting GM or its products, such changes could significantly affect our profitability, financial condition, and access to the capital markets. In addition, GM sponsors special-rate financing programs available through us. Under these programs, GM makes interest supplements or other support payments to us. These programs increase our financing volume and our share of financed GM vehicle sales. If GM were to adopt marketing strategies in the future that de-emphasized such programs in favor of other incentives, our financing volume could be reduced.\nThere is no assurance that the global automotive market or GM's share of that market will not suffer downturns in the future, and any negative impact could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe depend on the financial condition of GM dealers.\nOur profitability is dependent on the financial condition of the GM-franchised dealerships in our commercial lending portfolio, including the levels of inventory dealers carry in response to retail demand for new GM vehicles and used vehicles, and the level\nof wholesale borrowing required by dealers for inventory acquisitions, construction projects to dealership facilities and working capital. Our business may be negatively affected if, during periods of economic slowdown or recession, dealers reduce borrowing for inventory purchases or for other purposes, or are unable to sell or otherwise liquidate vehicle inventories and repay their wholesale, real estate and other loans to us. Decreased retail demand for GM vehicles can also adversely impact the overall financial condition of GM-franchised dealerships, possibly increasing defaults and net loss rates in our commercial lending portfolio and adversely impacting our ability to grow and, ultimately, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur ability to continue to fund our business is dependent on a number of financing sources.\nWe depend on various financing sources to finance our loan and lease originations and commercial lending business.\nDependence on Secured Financing\nWe utilize secured revolving credit facilities in most of our markets to fund our retail and commercial finance activities. As our volume of loan and lease originations increases, and as our commercial lending business grows, we will require the expansion of our borrowing capacity on our existing credit facilities or the addition of new revolving credit facilities. We cannot guarantee that our revolving credit facilities will continue to be available beyond the current maturity dates on reasonable terms or at all.\nSome of our revolving credit facilities in Europe and Latin America are uncommitted, meaning that the lenders under these facilities are not obligated to fund borrowing requests and may terminate the facilities at any time and for any reason. The availability of secured revolving credit facilities depends, in part, on factors outside of our control, including regulatory capital treatment for unfunded bank lines of credit, the financial strength and strategic objectives of the banks that participate in our credit facilities and the availability of bank liquidity in general. If we are unable to extend or replace these facilities or arrange new credit facilities or other types of interim financing, we will have to curtail or suspend origination and funding activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nMost of our revolving credit facilities contain borrowing bases or advance formulas which require us to pledge loans and lease-related assets in excess of the amounts which we can borrow under those facilities. Accordingly, credit deterioration in pledged collateral resulting from weakened economic conditions or any other factor, would require us to pledge additional finance and lease assets to support the same borrowing levels and to replace delinquent or defaulted collateral. The pledge of additional finance and lease assets to support our revolving credit facilities would adversely impact our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nAdditionally, certain revolving credit facilities contain various covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios, asset quality, and portfolio performance ratios (portfolio net loss and delinquency ratios, and pool level cumulative net loss ratios) as well as limits on deferment levels. Failure to meet any of these covenants could result in an event of default under these agreements. If an event of default occurs under these agreements, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under these agreements to be immediately due and payable, enforce their interests against collateral pledged under these agreements or restrict our ability to obtain additional borrowings under these facilities.\nDependence on Securitization Programs\nIn the North America Segment and in Europe, we rely upon our ability to transfer loan and lease assets to securitization trusts and sell securities in the asset-backed securities market to generate cash proceeds for repayment of credit facilities and to generate additional assets. Accordingly, adverse changes in our asset-backed securities program or in the asset-backed securities market in general have in the past, and could in the future, materially adversely affect our ability to originate and securitize loans and leases on a timely basis and upon terms acceptable to us. Any adverse change or delay would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe will continue to require the execution of securitization transactions in order to fund our future liquidity needs. There can be no assurance that funding will be available to us through these sources or, if available, that it will be on terms acceptable to us. If these sources of funding are not available to us on a regular basis for any reason, including the occurrence of events of default, deterioration in loss experience on the collateral, disruption of the asset-backed market or otherwise, we would be required to revise the scale of our business, including the possible discontinuation of origination activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nDependence on Unsecured Debt Issuances\nOur ability to obtain unsecured funding at a reasonable cost is dependent, in large part, on GM's and our credit ratings or perceived creditworthiness. Credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, or other factors may affect our ability to access the capital markets at a reasonable cost or at all. Our inability to issue unsecured debt could force us to limit the scale\nof our business. A significant reduction in the amount of loans or leases we purchase or originate would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nTo service our debt, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors.\nOur ability to make payments on or to refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations depends on our ability to generate cash and our access to the capital markets in the future. These, to a certain extent, are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, capital market conditions and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe expect to continue to require substantial amounts of cash. Our primary cash requirements include the funding of:\n\u2022loan and lease purchases;\n\u2022advances to commercial lending customers;\n\u2022credit enhancement requirements in connection with securitization and credit facilities;\n\u2022interest and principal payments under our indebtedness;\n\u2022ongoing operating expenses;\n\u2022capital expenditures; and\n\u2022future acquisitions, if any.\nOur primary sources of future liquidity are expected to be:\n\u2022payments on loans, leases and commercial lending receivables not securitized;\n\u2022distributions received from securitization trusts;\n\u2022servicing fees;\n\u2022borrowings under our credit facilities or proceeds from secured debt facilities;\n\u2022further issuances of other debt securities, both secured and unsecured; and\n\u2022retail deposits.\nBecause we expect to continue to require substantial amounts of cash for the foreseeable future, we anticipate that we will need additional credit facilities and require the execution of additional securitization transactions and additional debt financings including unsecured note offerings. The type, timing and terms of financing selected by us will be dependent upon our cash needs, the availability of other financing sources and the prevailing conditions in the capital markets. There can be no assurance that funding will be available to us through these sources or, if available, that the funding will be on acceptable terms. If we are unable to execute securitization transactions and unsecured debt issuances on a regular basis, we would not have sufficient funds to finance new originations and, in such event, we would be required to revise the scale of our business, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under existing indebtedness.\nWe currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we have guaranteed a substantial amount of indebtedness incurred by our International Segment and our principal Canadian operating subsidiary. As of December 31, 2015, we have guaranteed approximately $3.6 billion in such indebtedness. Additionally, we have entered into intercompany loan agreements with several of our subsidiaries in Europe and Latin America, providing these companies with access to liquidity to support originations and other activities. As of December 31, 2015, we have entered into $4.2 billion in such intercompany loan agreements, of which $45 million was outstanding. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance, and our ability to enter into additional credit facilities and securitization transactions as well as other debt financings, which, to a certain extent, are subject to economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, capital markets and other factors beyond our control.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows in the future to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or to obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that any refinancings will be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms. The inability to service or refinance our existing debt or to obtain additional financing would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations.\nThe degree to which we are leveraged creates risks, including:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022\nwe may find it more difficult to fund future credit enhancement requirements, operating costs, tax payments, capital expenditures or general corporate expenditures;\n\u2022\nwe may have to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash resources to payments on our outstanding indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations and future business opportunities; and\n\u2022\nwe may be vulnerable to adverse general economic, capital markets and industry conditions.\nOur credit facilities may require us to comply with certain financial ratios and covenants, including minimum asset quality maintenance requirements. These restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain financing or to engage in other necessary or desirable business activities.\nIf we cannot comply with the requirements in our credit facilities, then our lenders may increase our borrowing costs, remove us as servicer or declare the outstanding debt immediately due and payable. If our debt payments were accelerated, any assets pledged to secure these facilities might not be sufficient to fully repay the debt. These lenders may foreclose upon their collateral, including the restricted cash in these credit facilities. These events may also result in a default under our senior note indentures. We may not be able to obtain a waiver of these provisions or refinance our debt, if needed. In such case, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would materially suffer.\nDefaults and prepayments on loans and leases purchased or originated by us could adversely affect our operations.\nOur financial condition, liquidity and results of operations depend, to a material extent, on the performance of loans and leases in our portfolio. Obligors under contracts acquired or originated by us, including dealer obligors in our commercial lending portfolio, may default during the term of their loan or lease. Generally, we bear the full risk of losses resulting from defaults. In the event of a default, the collateral value of the financed vehicle or, in the case of a commercial obligor, the value of the inventory and other commercial assets we finance usually does not cover the outstanding amount due to us, including the costs of recovery and asset disposition.\nThe amounts owed to us by any given dealership or dealership group in our commercial lending portfolio can be significant. The amount of potential loss resulting from the default of a dealer in our commercial lending portfolio can, therefore, be material even after liquidating the dealer's inventory and other assets to offset the defaulted obligation. Additionally, because the receivables in our commercial lending portfolio may include complex arrangements including guarantees, inter-creditor agreements, mortgages and other liens, our ability to recover and dispose of the underlying inventory and other collateral may be time-consuming and expensive, thereby increasing our potential loss.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses on our finance receivables which reflects management's estimates of inherent losses for these receivables. If the allowance is inadequate, we would recognize the losses in excess of that allowance as an expense and results of operations would be adversely affected. A material adjustment to our allowance for loan losses and the corresponding decrease in earnings could limit our ability to enter into future securitizations and other financings, thus impairing our ability to finance our business.\nAn increase in defaults would reduce the cash flows generated by us, and distributions of cash to us from our secured debt facilities would be delayed and the ultimate amount of cash distributable to us would be less, which would have an adverse effect on our liquidity.\nCustomer prepayments and dealer repayments on commercial obligations, which are generally revolving in nature, affect the amount of finance charge income we receive over the life of the loans. If prepayment levels increase for any reason and we are not able to replace the prepaid receivables with newly-originated loans, we will receive less finance charge income and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state and local laws and regulations.\nAs an entity operating in the financial services sector, we are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations that may be costly to adhere to and may affect both our operating results and our ability to service our earning assets. Compliance with these laws and regulations requires that we maintain forms, processes, procedures, controls and the infrastructure to support these requirements and these laws and regulations often create operational constraints both on our ability to implement servicing procedures and on pricing. Laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers. The failure to comply with these laws could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties for us, monetary damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation, brand and valued customer relationships.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") is extensive and significant legislation that, among other things, strengthens the regulatory oversight of securities and capital markets activities by the SEC and increases the regulation of the securitization markets in the U.S. The various requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act may substantially impact the origination, servicing and securitization program of our subsidiaries.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also created the CFPB, a federal agency that has extensive rulemaking and enforcement authority. The CFPB has indicated an intention to review the actions of indirect auto finance companies such as us with regard to pricing activities and issued a bulletin to such lenders on how to limit fair lending risk under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. On August 31, 2015 we became subject to supervision and examination by the CFPB as a \u201clarger participant\u201d in the automobile finance market. Gaining supervisory power over nonbank lenders such as us will allow the agency to conduct comprehensive and rigorous on-site examinations that could result in enforcement actions, fines, and mandated process, procedure or product-related changes or consumer refunds if violations of law or unfair lending practices are found, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn July 2014, we were served with a subpoena by the U.S. Department of Justice directing us to produce certain documents relating to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 and affiliates\u2019 origination and securitization of sub-prime automobile loans since 2007 in connection with an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice in contemplation of a civil proceeding for potential violations of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989. Among other matters, the subpoena requests information relating to the underwriting criteria used to originate these automobile loans and the representations and warranties relating to those underwriting criteria that were made in connection with the securitization of the automobile loans. We have subsequently been served with additional investigative subpoenas to produce documents from state attorneys general and other governmental offices relating to our retail auto loan business and securitization of auto loans. In October 2014, we received a document request from the SEC in connection with its investigation into certain practices in sub-prime auto loan securitization. These investigations are ongoing and could in the future result in the imposition of damages, fines or civil or criminal claims and/or penalties. No assurance can be given that the ultimate outcome of the investigations or any resulting proceedings would not materially and adversely affect us or any of our subsidiaries and affiliates.\nOur profitability is dependent upon retail demand for automobiles and related automobile financing and the ability of customers to repay loans and leases, and our business may be negatively affected during times of low automobile sales, fluctuating wholesale prices and lease residual values, rising interest rates, volatility in exchange rates and high unemployment.\nGeneral. We are subject to changes in general economic conditions that are beyond our control. During periods of economic slowdown or recession, delinquencies, defaults, repossessions and losses generally increase. These periods also may be accompanied by increased unemployment rates, decreased demand for automobiles and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding loans and leases, which weakens collateral coverage and increases the amount of a loss in the event of default. Additionally, higher gasoline prices, declining stock market values, unstable real estate values, increasing unemployment levels, general availability of consumer credit and other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could increase loss frequency and decrease demand for automobiles as well as weaken collateral values on certain types of automobiles. In addition, during an economic slowdown or recession, our servicing costs may increase without a corresponding increase in our revenue. While we seek to manage these risks through the underwriting criteria and collection methods we employ, no assurance can be given that these criteria or methods will afford adequate protection against these risks. Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, defaults, repossessions or losses or increased servicing costs could adversely affect our financial position, liquidity, results of operations and our ability to enter into future securitizations and credit facilities.\nWholesale Auction Values. We sell repossessed automobiles at wholesale auction markets located throughout the countries where we have operations. Auction proceeds from the sale of repossessed vehicles and other recoveries are usually not sufficient to cover the outstanding balance of the contract, and the resulting deficiency is charged off. We also sell automobiles returned to us at the end of lease terms. Decreased auction proceeds resulting from the depressed prices at which used automobiles may be sold during periods of economic slowdown or slack retail demand will result in higher losses for us. Furthermore, depressed wholesale prices for used automobiles may result from significant liquidations of rental or fleet inventories, financial difficulties of new vehicle manufacturers, discontinuance of vehicle brands and models and increased volume of trade-ins due to promotional programs offered by new vehicle manufacturers. Additionally, higher gasoline prices may decrease the wholesale auction values of certain types of vehicles.\nLeased Vehicle Residual Values and Return Rates. We project expected residual values and return volumes of the vehicles we lease. Actual proceeds realized by us upon the sale of a returned leased vehicle at lease termination may be lower than the amount projected, which reduces the profitability of the lease transaction to us. Among the factors that can affect the value of returned lease vehicles are the volume of vehicles returned, economic conditions and the quality or perceived quality, safety or reliability of the vehicles. Actual return volumes may be higher than expected and can be influenced by contractual lease-end values relative to then-existing values, marketing programs for new vehicles and general economic conditions. All of these, alone or in combination, have the potential to adversely affect the profitability of our lease program and financial results.\nInterest Rates. Our profitability may be directly affected by the level of and fluctuations in interest rates, which affect the gross interest rate spread we earn on our portfolio. As the level of interest rates change, our net interest margin on new originations\neither increases or decreases since the rates charged on our loans and leases are generally fixed rates and are limited by market and competitive conditions, restricting our opportunity to pass on increased interest costs to the customer. We believe that our financial position, liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected during any period of higher interest rates, possibly to a material degree.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates. We are exposed to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in currency exchange rates cannot always be predicted or hedged. As a result, unfavorable changes in exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nLabor Market Conditions. Competition to hire and retain personnel possessing the skills and experience required by us could contribute to an increase in our employee turnover rate. High turnover or an inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our delinquency, default and net loss rates, our ability to grow and, ultimately, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nThere is a high degree of risk associated with sub-prime borrowers.\nA substantial portion of our origination and servicing activities in the North America Segment have historically involved sub-prime automobile receivables. Sub-prime borrowers are associated with higher-than-average delinquency and default rates. The actual rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions and losses with respect to those borrowers could also be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn. While we believe that we effectively manage these risks with our proprietary credit scoring system, risk-based pricing and other underwriting policies, and our servicing and collection methods, no assurance can be given that these criteria or methods will be effective in the future. In the event that we underestimate the default risk or underprice contracts that we purchase, our financial position, liquidity and results of operations would be adversely affected, possibly to a material degree.\nWe do not control the operations of SAIC-GMAC, and we are subject to the risks of operating in China.\nWe do not control the operations of SAIC-GMAC, as it is a joint venture, and we do not have a majority interest in the joint venture. In the joint venture, we share ownership and management with other parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities, or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture. Joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities, as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. We are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our co-owners as well as with the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes or relationships deteriorate, our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected. The benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, and as such, we do not receive the full benefits from a successful joint venture. As a result of having limited control over the actions of the joint venture, we may be unable to prevent misconduct or other violations of applicable laws. Moreover, the joint venture may not follow the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. To the extent another party makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issues arise within the joint venture, we may have to take responsive or other action or we may be subject to penalties, fines or other related actions for these activities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to the risks of operating in China. The automotive finance market in China is highly competitive and subject to significant governmental regulation. As the Chinese market continues to develop, we anticipate that additional competitors, both international and domestic, will seek to enter the Chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share. Increased competition may result in reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share. In addition, business in China is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive sales volume in China. If SAIC-GMAC is unable to maintain its position in the Chinese market or if vehicle sales in China decrease or do not continue to increase, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nA security breach or a cyber-attack could adversely affect our business.\nA security breach or cyber-attack of our computer systems could interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation. If third parties or our employees are able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate our customers' personal information or contract information, or if we give third parties or our employees improper access to our customers' personal information or contract information, we could be subject to liability. This liability could include identity theft or other similar fraud-related claims. This liability could also include claims for other misuses or losses of personal information, including for unauthorized marketing purposes. Other liabilities could include claims alleging misrepresentation of our privacy and data security practices. We could also be subject to regulatory action in certain jurisdictions, particularly in North America and Europe.\nWe rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure online transmission of confidential consumer information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms\nthat we use to protect sensitive customer transaction data. A party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations. We may be required to expend capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or cyber-attacks or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches or attacks and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to such breaches or attacks. Our security measures are designed to protect against security breaches and cyber-attacks, but our failure to prevent such security breaches and cyber-attacks could subject us to liability, decrease our profitability and damage our reputation.\nOur operations outside the U.S. expose us to additional risks.\nThe international operations are subject to many of the same risks as our U.S. operations. In addition to those risks, the international operations, including the operations of SAIC-GMAC, are subject to certain additional risks, such as the following:\n\u2022\neconomic downturns in foreign countries or geographic regions where we have significant operations, such as Brazil and China;\n\u2022\nmultiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to change;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor regulations;\n\u2022\nconsequences from changes in tax laws;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability to repatriate profits or transfer cash into or out of foreign countries and the tax consequences of such repatriations and transfers;\n\u2022\ndevaluations in currencies;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability, natural calamities, war, and terrorism; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with laws and regulations applicable to international operations, including anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and international trade and economic sanctions laws.\nThe effects of these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect our business.", "PERMNO": 75858, "SIC": 6141, "TIC": "GM2"}
