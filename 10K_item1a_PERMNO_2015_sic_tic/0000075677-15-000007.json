{"cik": "75677", "company": "PACKAGING CORP OF AMERICA", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nSome of the statements in this report and, in particular, statements found in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include statements about our expectations regarding our future liquidity, earnings, expenditures, and financial condition. These statements are often identified by the words \"will,\" \"should,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"estimate,\" \"hope,\" or similar expressions. These statements reflect management\u2019s current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. There are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond our control. These factors, risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors described below.\nOur actual results, performance, or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements, and accordingly, we can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forward-\nlooking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of them do so, what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition. In view of these uncertainties, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of events after the date hereof.\nIn addition to the risks and uncertainties we discuss elsewhere in this Form 10-K (particularly in \"Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\") or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we project in any forward-looking statement.\nIndustry Risks\nIndustry Cyclicality - Changes in the prices of our products could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in industry capacity can create changes in prices, sales volumes, and margins for most of our products, particularly commodity grades of packaging and paper products. Prices for all of our products are driven by many factors, including general economic conditions, demand for our products, and competitive conditions in our industry, and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes, which are often volatile. If supply exceeds demand, prices for our products could decline, resulting in decreased earnings and cash generated from operations. Additionally, market conditions beyond our control can affect the prices for our commodity products. If the prices for our products decline or if we are unable to control our costs, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows, profitability, and liquidity.\nCompetition - The intensity of competition in the industries in which we operate could result in downward pressure on pricing and volume, which could lower earnings and cash generated from operations. Our industries are highly competitive, with no single containerboard, corrugated packaging, or white paper producer having a dominant position. Containerboard and commodity white paper products cannot generally be differentiated by producer, which tends to intensify price competition. The corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions, as well as other factors including innovation, design, quality, and service. To the extent that one or more competitors are more successful than we are with respect to any key competitive factor, our business could be adversely affected. Our packaging products also compete, to some extent, with various other packaging materials, including products made of paper, plastics, wood, and various types of metal. Our white paper products compete with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives. Increasing shifts to electronic alternatives have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on usage of these products. The intensity of competition could lead to a reduction in our market share as well as lower sales prices for our products, both of which could reduce our earnings and cash flow.\nSeveral of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources, greater manufacturing economies of scale, greater energy self sufficiency, or lower operating costs, compared with our company. We may be unable to compete with these companies particularly during economic downturns. Some of the factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete in the markets in which we participate include the entry of new competitors (including overseas producers, who have increased imports of white paper to the United States in recent years and some of whom we believe may be violating international trade rules) into the markets we serve, our competitors' pricing strategies, our inability to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, and our inability to maintain the cost-efficiency of our facilities.\nCompany Risks\nInflation and Other General Cost Increases - We are subject to both contractual, inflation, and other general cost increases. If we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases, growth, and/or cost reductions in our operations, these inflation and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect of our operating cash flows, profitability, and liquidity.\nIn 2014, our total company costs including cost of sales (COS) and selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) was $5.1 billion, and excluding non-cash costs (depreciation, pension, and share-based compensation expense) was $4.7 billion. A 1% increase in COS and SG&A costs would increase costs by $51 million and cash costs by $47 million.\nCertain items of product input costs have historically been subject to more cost volatility including fiber, purchased energy, and chemicals.\nCost of Fiber - An increase in the cost of fiber could increase our manufacturing costs and lower our earnings. The market price of wood fiber varies based upon availability, source, and the costs of fuels used in the harvesting and\ntransportation of wood fiber. The cost and availability of wood fiber can also be impacted by weather, general logging conditions, and geography.\nThe availability and cost of recycled fiber depends heavily on recycling rates and the domestic and global demand for recycled products. We purchase recycled fiber for use at seven of our eight mills. In 2014, we purchased approximately 493,000 tons of recycled fiber, net of the recycled fiber generated by our corrugated box plants. The amount of recycled fiber purchased each year varies based upon production and the prices of both recycled fiber and wood fiber.\nPeriods of supply and demand imbalance have tended to create significant price volatility. Periods of higher recycled fiber costs and unusual price volatility have occurred in the past and may occur again in the future, which could result in lower or volatile earnings.\nCost of Purchased Energy and Chemicals - An increase in the cost of purchased energy and chemicals could lead to higher manufacturing costs, resulting in reduced earnings. We have the ability to use various types of purchased fuels in our manufacturing operations, including coal, bark, natural gas, and oil. Energy prices, in particular prices for oil and natural gas, have fluctuated dramatically in the past. New and more stringent environmental regulations may discourage, or make more expensive, the use of certain fuels. In addition, costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing also fluctuate. These fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility. If energy and chemical prices rise, our production costs and transportation costs will increase and cause higher manufacturing costs and reduced earnings.\nMaterial Disruption of Manufacturing - A material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales, and/or negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our business depends on continuous operation of our facilities, particularly at our mills. Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within such facilities, could cease operations unexpectedly for a significant period of time due to a number of events, including:\n\u2022\nUnscheduled maintenance outages.\n\u2022\nProlonged power failures.\n\u2022\nEquipment failure.\n\u2022\nExplosion of a boiler.\n\u2022\nDisruption in the supply of raw materials, such as wood fiber, energy, or chemicals.\n\u2022\nA chemical spill or release.\n\u2022\nClosure related to environmental concerns.\n\u2022\nLabor difficulties.\n\u2022\nDisruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks, and tunnels.\n\u2022\nFires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, or other catastrophes.\n\u2022\nTerrorism or threats of terrorism.\n\u2022\nOther operational problems.\nThese events could harm our ability to serve our customers and lead to higher costs and reduced earnings.\nEnvironmental Matters - PCA may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and future operations. We are subject to, and must comply with, a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws, particularly those relating to air and water quality, waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with those laws. See Item 7. \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters\" for estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years. New and more stringent environmental regulations, including new U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rules relating to industrial boiler emissions known as the Boiler MACT rules, are expected to require us to incur significant additional capital expenditures to modify or replace certain of our boilers. In addition, environmental regulations may increase the cost of our raw materials and purchased energy. Although we have established reserves to provide for known environmental liabilities, these reserves may change over time due to the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, which might require additional significant environmental expenditures.\nCustomer Concentration - OfficeMax represents a significant portion of PCA\u2019s paper business. We have a supply agreement with OfficeMax, our largest customer in the paper segment. The agreement requires OfficeMax to buy, and us to supply, at least 80% of OfficeMax\u2019s requirements for office papers through December 2017; however, there are circumstances that could cause the agreement to terminate before 2017. If this were to occur, OfficeMax's purchase obligations under the agreement would phase out over two years. OfficeMax was acquired by Office Depot, Inc. late in 2013. Office Depot has since\nagreed to be acquired by Staples, Inc. on February 4, 2015. The pending acquisition by Staples is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. If the acquisition of Office Depot by Staples is consummated, the risks described below may be intensified.\nOur agreement with OfficeMax will continue to remain in effect after a merger or acquisition as to the office paper requirements of the legacy OfficeMax business. However, we cannot predict how any merger or acquisition will affect the financial condition of the ultimate entity, the paper requirements of the legacy Office Max business, the purchasing decisions of the ultimate entity or the effects on pricing or competition for office papers. In 2014, sales to Office Depot (including Office Max) represented 44% of our Paper segment sales. If these sales are reduced, whether as a result of the pending integration of Office Max into Office Depot, the future acquisition of Office Depot by Staples or otherwise, we would need to find new customers, which could harm our profitability if our prices are lower or costs are higher. Any significant deterioration in the financial condition of the ultimate entity affecting its ability to pay or any other change that results in its willingness to purchase our products will harm our business and results of operations.\nAcquisition Integration - The acquired businesses may underperform relative to our expectations, and we may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses. The acquired businesses may underperform relative to our expectations, which may cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community\u2019s expectations. If the acquired businesses underperform relative to our expectations, or if we fail to successfully integrate the businesses, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nCyber Security - Risks related to security breaches of company, customer, employee, and vendor information, as well as the technology that manages our operations and other business processes, could adversely affect our business. We rely on various information technology systems to capture, process, store, and report data and interact with customers, vendors, and employees. Despite careful security and controls design, implementation, updating, and internal and independent third-party assessments, our information technology systems, and those of our third party providers, could become subject to cyber attacks or security breaches. Network, system, and data breaches could result in misappropriation of sensitive data or operational disruptions including interruption to systems availability and denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us. Misuse of internal applications; theft of intellectual property, trade secrets, or other corporate assets; and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information could stem from such incidents. Delayed sales, slowed production, or other repercussions resulting from these disruptions could result in lost sales, business delays, and negative publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nRisks Related to Economic, Financial, and Investment Risk\nIncreased leverage may reduce our operating flexibility. At December 31, 2014, we had $2.3 billion of long-term debt outstanding and a $350.0 million undrawn revolving credit facility. We and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our current borrowings, plus any future borrowings, may affect our future operations, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nResult in additional cash requirements to make interest and maturity payments on our outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022\nIncrease our vulnerability to adverse changes in our business or industry conditions;\n\u2022\nLimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate, and other purposes;\n\u2022\nLimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and\n\u2022\nLimit our flexibility to make acquisitions.\nFurther, if we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions to secure additional cash by selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing investments.\nMarket Price of our Common Stock - The market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of the stock to decline. Securities markets worldwide periodically experience significant price declines and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market, or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance. In addition, our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, and in response, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly.\nGeneral Economic Conditions - Adverse business and global economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. General global economic conditions adversely affect the demand and production of consumer goods, employment levels, the availability and cost of credit, and ultimately, the profitability of our business. High unemployment rates, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business\ninvestment, and lower consumer spending typically result in decreased demand for our products. These conditions are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on our business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial position.", "PERMNO": 87541, "SIC": 2650, "TIC": "PKG"}
