In addition, from time to time we provide information, including information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that contains forward-looking statements concerning, among other things, projected financial performance, total addressable market, market and industry sector growth, product development and commercialization or other aspects of future operations. Such statements are based on the assumptions and expectations of our management at the time such statements are made. We caution investors that our performance and any forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, the following:\nGlobal Operational Risks\nAdverse economic and geopolitical conditions may impact our operations and financial performance.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on global macroeconomic, specific foreign country and U.S. domestic economic conditions. Adverse conditions in the macroeconomic environment may result in a decreased demand for our products and services, constrained credit and liquidity, reduced government spending and volatility in equity and foreign exchange markets. In addition, to the extent the global economy experiences a significant downturn or volatility, we may be exposed to impairments of certain assets if their values deteriorate. Tighter credit due to economic conditions may diminish our future borrowing ability and increase borrowing costs under our existing credit facilities. Customers' ability to pay for our products and services may also be impaired, which could lead to an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable.\nA majority of our business comes from outside the U.S. and our customers supply a wide array of goods and services to most of the world\u2019s major economic regions. International revenue represented 57.9%, 60.9% and 61.9% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In fiscal year 2019, our largest geographic revenue bases included the U.S., Japan, Germany and South Korea.\nIf any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorates or suffers a period of uncertainty, our business and performance may be negatively impacted through reduced customer and government spending, changes in purchasing cycles or timing, reduced access to credit for our customers, or other factors impacting our international sales and collections. Furthermore, customer spending levels in any foreign jurisdiction may be adversely impacted by changes in domestic policies, including tax and trade policies. For example, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union effective as of January 31, 2020 and is now in a period of transition until the end of 2020. We have significant operations in the United Kingdom and the European Union. It remains unclear as to what the terms of the new relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union will be. Terms that are disadvantageous to us, including those related to trade, tax and the movement of people across borders could negatively impact our results.\nA substantial portion of our license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts which typically have a high rate of customer renewal. If the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors, our lease license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected. As a result, our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows may also be adversely impacted during those periods.\nWe face compliance risk as a result of our international operations and our sales model, including pertaining to anti-corruption and data privacy laws.\nThe laws with which we need to comply due to our international operations vary from country to country and are subject to frequent change and interpretation. In May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which governs data privacy practices within the European Economic Area (EEA), went into effect. The law, which applies to our data processing activities within the EEA, as well as the processing of EEA citizen data globally, imposes various compliance obligations related to the handling of personal data in the delivery of our products and services and to business operations involving employee data. Compliance with the GDPR has and will continue to require deployment of substantial resources and increased costs. If we fail to comply with the GDPR, it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of annual worldwide revenue, private lawsuits, extensive and prescriptive consent decrees or judgments that may require additional resources or expenses for compliance and may cause reputational damage.\nIn the U.S., California implemented the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) as of January 2020, which requires compliance measures similar to those of the GDPR and establishes the first state standard for a comprehensive set of data privacy rights. Several other states have proposed data privacy laws that would impose obligations on us with respect to how we collect and use personal data, including customer data. In order to comply with U.S. state laws, as well as any data breach notification laws that vary across states, we may be required to invest in additional resources or tools to manage our data\nprocessing activities. If we fail to comply with the requirements of U.S. data privacy and data breach notification laws, we will be subject to state monetary fines, consent decrees issued by the Federal Trade Commission, and possible reputational damage.\nOur global reach, including within countries considered high-risk environments for public corruption, exposes us to risks associated with violations of anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. We develop and sell software and consulting services and maintain support operations in more than 40 countries whose laws and practices differ from one another and are subject to unexpected changes. Managing these geographically diverse operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance. To promote compliance, we forbid our agents and employees from engaging in corrupt behavior and have implemented a compliance plan to prevent and detect violations of anti-corruption laws. There remains, however, a risk that illegal conduct could occur thereby exposing us to the financial and reputational risks associated with a violation of anti-corruption laws.\nNoncompliance with these regulations could adversely impact our financial results or stock price as well as divert management time and effort.\nWe are subject to trade restrictions that could impact our ability to sell to customers and result in liability for violations.\nDue to the global nature of our business, we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations that prohibit the shipment or provision of certain products and services to certain countries, governments and persons targeted by the U.S., including the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) and economic and trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). During the second quarter of 2019, the BIS placed certain entities on the Entity List. Certain of our existing and prospective customers, including Huawei, were included in this list. In addition, restrictions implemented by OFAC restrict our ability to sell to some companies in certain countries, such as Russia. The Entity List and OFAC restrictions limit our ability to deliver products and services to these customers and, in the absence of a license, our ability to sell products and services to these customers in the future. The inclusion of companies on the Entity List may encourage them to seek substitute products from competitors who are not subject to these restrictions or to develop their own products. We cannot predict whether or when any changes will be made that eliminate or decrease these limitations on our ability to sell products and provide services to these customers. Additionally, other customers may continue to be added to the Entity List and/or be subjected to trade restrictions. There may be indirect impacts that cannot be quantified, including that our business may also be impacted by other trade restrictions that may be imposed by the U.S., China, or other countries. Restrictions on our ability to sell and ship to customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nViolators of these export controls may be subject to significant penalties, which may include considerable monetary fines, criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees, a denial of export privileges, and suspension or debarment from selling products or services to the federal government. Any such penalties could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation could cause significant expense and reputational harm and distract senior executives from managing normal day-to-day operations.\nOur products could also be shipped to denied parties by third parties, including our channel partners. Even though we take precautions to ensure that our channel partners comply with all relevant import and export regulations, any failure by channel partners to comply with such regulations could have negative consequences for us, including reputational harm, government investigations and penalties.\nThe effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuation may adversely impact our revenue, expenses, cash flows and financial conditions.\nAs a result of our significant international presence, we have revenue, expenses, cash, accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies, most notably the British Pound, Euro, Japanese Yen, South Korean Won and Indian Rupee. Our revenue and operating results are adversely affected when the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to foreign currencies and are positively affected when the U.S. Dollar weakens relative to foreign currencies. If the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, certain channel partners who pay us in U.S. Dollars may have trouble paying on time or may have trouble distributing our products due to the impact of the currency exchange fluctuation on such channel partner's cash flows. This may impact our ability to distribute our products into certain regions and markets.\nWe seek to reduce our currency exchange transaction risks primarily through our normal operating and treasury activities, including derivative instruments, but there can be no assurance that these activities will be successful in reducing these risks. In addition, we incur transaction fees in the usage of such derivative instruments. Changes in currency exchange rates will affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nA natural disaster or catastrophic event may disrupt our business.\nA significant portion of our software development personnel, source code and computer equipment is located at operating facilities in the U.S., Canada, India, Japan and throughout Europe. The occurrence of a natural disaster or other unforeseen catastrophe at any of these facilities could cause disruptions to our operations, services and product development activities. Additionally, if we experience problems that impair our business infrastructure, such as a computer virus, telephone system failure or an intentional disruption of our information technology systems by a third party, these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and the ability to meet financial reporting deadlines. Further, because our sales are not generally consistent across quarterly periods, the potential adverse effects resulting from any of the events described above or any other disruption of our business could be accentuated if they occur close to the end of a fiscal quarter.\nIn addition, our business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Any outbreak of contagious diseases, and other adverse public health developments, may cause us or our customers to temporarily suspend operations in the affected city or country. In addition, a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products, our ability to collect against existing trade receivables and our operating results.\nIndustry Operational Risks\nOur industry is highly competitive, which could result in downward pressure on our prices.\nWe continue to experience competition across all markets for our products and services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do, and some have well-established relationships with our current and potential customers. Our current and potential competitors also include firms that have competed, or may in the future compete, by means of open source licensing. Companies we have, or could have, strategic alliances with could reduce or discontinue technical, software development and marketing relationships with us for competitive purposes. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services, or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices or offer discounts or other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Our maintenance products, which include software license updates and product support fees, are generally priced as a percentage of new software license fees. Our competitors may offer lower percentage pricing on product updates and support. Some competitors may bundle software products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices, product implementations or wider geographical license usage provisions. Any of these practices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain products.\nFurthermore, if we do not adapt pricing models to reflect changes in customer usage of our products or changes in customer demand, our new software license revenues could decrease. Additionally, increased distribution of applications through application service providers, including software-as-a-service providers, may reduce the average price of our products or adversely affect other sales of our products, reducing new software license revenues unless we can offset price reductions with volume increases.\nThese competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions and/or increased operating costs, and could result in lower revenues, margins and net income.\nWe may not be successful in developing and marketing new products to adequately address the rapidly changing technology industry.\nWe operate in an industry generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions, which can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable. A major factor in our future success will be our ability to anticipate technological changes and to develop and introduce, in a timely manner, new products to meet those changes. Our ability to grow revenue will be dependent on our ability to respond to customer needs in the areas of, among others, 5G, autonomous vehicles, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and electrification, and to leverage cloud computing and new computing platforms. In addition, our future success may depend on our ability to continue to develop a systems integrator ecosystem able to handle integrations and process and application development to address the challenge of the increasingly complex integration of our products\u2019 different functionalities to address customers\u2019 requirements. In addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner to access their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, integrations, data and content, even though not developed or sold by us, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations, all of which could harm our business.\nWe devote substantial resources to research and development, which could cause our operating results to decline.\nWe devote substantial resources to research and development. New competitors, technological advances in the software development industry by us or our competitors, acquisitions, entry into new markets, or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue, operating results could decline. In addition, our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue, which could negatively impact financial results.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely basis, new products or product enhancements or that the new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that we will successfully manage the transition from existing products. Software products as complex as those we offer may contain undetected errors when first introduced, or as new versions are released, and the likelihood of errors is increased as a result of our commitment to the frequency of product releases. There can be no assurance that errors will not be found in any new or enhanced products after the commencement of commercial shipments. Certain products require a higher level of sales and support expertise. Failure of our sales channel, particularly the independent channel partners, to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an adverse impact on our sales in future periods. Any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation, or increased service and warranty costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nConsolidation among our customers as well as our industry competitors may negatively impact our operating results.\nThere have been consolidations among our customers in the semiconductor, electronics and automotive industries, among others. This may result in the newly combined entity wanting the most favorable pricing from the former contracts and expecting larger volume discounts on future purchases. If a customer is acquired by an entity that does not utilize our products in favor of a competing product, we may not have future orders from the enterprise. Further, consolidation of our competitors may result in synergies that allow those competitors to benefit from broader sales channels and increased access to capital. Any of these impacts could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe price of our common stock is subject to volatility.\nThe market price of securities of software companies is subject to significant fluctuations. The valuation and trading price of our common stock may not be predictable. Factors that may adversely impact our share price include our failure to meet analyst expectations, reduced expectations regarding financial outlook, increases in our debt levels, changes in management or our material announcements or those of our competitors. In addition, volatility could result from causes that are unrelated to our operating performance such as conditions in the financial markets or the software industry generally.\nCompany Operational Risks\nWe are dependent upon our channel partners for a significant percentage of our revenue.\nWe distribute our products through a global network of independent channel partners, which accounted for 22.9%, 22.4% and 24.8% of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Channel partners sell our software products to new and existing customers, expand installations within the existing customer base, offer consulting\nservices and provide the first line of technical support. In Asia-Pacific and EMEA, we are highly dependent upon our channel partners. Difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners, such as failure to meet performance criteria and differences in handling customer relationships, could adversely affect our performance. Additionally, the loss of any major channel partner, including a channel partner's decision to sell competing products rather than ours, could result in reduced revenue. Moreover, our future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of our channel partners to dedicate the resources necessary to promote our portfolio of products and to support a larger installed base within each of our geographic regions. If the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so, we may be unable to sustain revenue growth.\nWe have been increasing the number of channel partners, particularly in international locations. The business relationships with these channel partners are recently established and could result in additional compliance burdens for us. In addition, these partners have a less-established payment history and revenue from these partners could come with a higher rate of bad debt expense. Where channel partners operate on our behalf to collect and process personal data of customer contacts, failure to comply with relevant data privacy laws in the handling of such personal data could result in our liability for any fines, civil suits or non-financial performance obligations imposed by regulatory authorities on these partners with respect to our customer data.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefit of our acquisitions and such acquisitions could pose risks to our business.\nWe consummate acquisitions to support our long-term strategic direction. We have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years, and in 2019 we acquired Granta Design, Helic, DfR Solutions, LST and Dynardo.\nAny acquisitions that we complete may present risks, including: difficulty in integrating the management teams, strategies, cultures and operations of the companies or businesses; failing to achieve anticipated synergies, revenue increases or cost savings; difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines; difficulty with sales, distribution and marketing functions; failure to develop new products and services that utilize the technologies and resources of the companies; disruption of our ongoing business and diversion of management's attention to transition or integration issues; liabilities that were not identified during the buying process; the loss of our key employees, customers, partners and channel partners or those of the acquired company; and cybersecurity and data privacy risks, including any liabilities for failure to comply with data privacy laws and obligations for collection, use and retention of personal data.\nFuture acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant cash resources; the incurrence of debt, which increases our interest expense and leverage; or the issuance of equity, which is dilutive to stockholders and may decrease earnings per share.\nWe allocate a portion of the purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets. If we do not recognize all the economic benefits of an acquisition, there could be an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. Furthermore, impairment charges are generally not tax-deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period the impairment is recorded.\nIf we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by our management or the financial and industry analysts, there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Where customer contacts and leads are a significant consideration in the purchase price or expected financial outcome of an acquisition, failure to identify or mitigate data privacy concerns with the collection, use and retention of personal data may adversely impact our ability to use this information as anticipated and regulatory obligations may require that we delete all or a portion of the database, or take additional remediation measures before use. This may impact the value of the acquisition or reduce forecasted sales.\nThe implementation of a new CRM system may not achieve the corporate benefits initially identified in the anticipated time frame or at all.\nWe are in the process of implementing new functionality in our existing Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. While this system is anticipated to simplify the demand generation, sales cycle, order processing and customer service activities, there is a risk that the project will not achieve the anticipated benefits or that the benefits will not be achieved as quickly as anticipated. There is also a risk that we will have to write off previously capitalized expenditures if the project is not successful or if implementation decisions regarding the project are modified. The project implementation timeline and scope may change and become longer and broader as new facets of the design and implementation efforts are undertaken. This may take the attention of key operational management away from other aspects of the business, including the integration of acquisitions, and may also result in increased consulting and software costs. These factors may have a significant negative impact on our business, financial position, profit, cash flows and reputation.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key talent, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends upon the continued service of our senior executives and our key technical and sales employees. Each of our executive officers and key technical personnel could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. The loss of any of our senior executives or key personnel for which there has not been adequate knowledge-sharing and transfer might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could materially harm our business and customer relationships.\nIn addition, because of the highly technical nature of our products and services, we must attract and retain highly skilled engineering and development personnel. The market for this talent is highly competitive and we have difficulty filling these roles for this reason. While we have historically recruited from outside of the U.S., in recent years our ability to do so has been curbed by more restrictive domestic immigration laws. If the immigration laws become even stricter or the processing of immigration requests becomes even more cumbersome or less efficient, or if we have less success in recruiting and retaining key personnel, our business, reputation and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to proceedings that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to various investigations, claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including commercial disputes, labor and employment matters, tax audits and litigations, alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters. Use or distribution of our products could generate product liability, regulatory infraction, or similar claims by our customers, end users, channel partners, government entities or other third parties. Sales and marketing activities that impact processing of personal data, as well as measures taken to ensure license compliance, may also result in claims by customers and individual employees of customers. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position, as well as cause damage to our reputation.\nWe may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results.\nWe license third-party software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and, in several instances, for inclusion in our products. We also license third-party software, including the software of our competitors, to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our professional services. These licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time, or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future. Third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology, or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors. If we are unable to obtain licenses to such third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to sell the affected products, our customers\u2019 use of the products may be interrupted, or our product development processes and professional services offerings may be disrupted, which could in turn harm our financial results, our customers' ability to utilize our software, and our reputation.\nWe may suffer reputational or financial harm if we have product standard or quality issues.\nWe have separate quality systems and registrations under the ISO 9001:2015 standard in addition to other governmental and industrial regulations. Our continued compliance with quality standards and favorable outcomes in periodic examinations is important to retain current customers and vital to procure new sales. If it was determined that we were not in compliance with various regulatory or ISO 9001 standards, our certificates of registration could be suspended, requiring remedial action and a time-consuming re-registration process. Product quality issues or failures could result in our reputation becoming diminished, resulting in a material adverse impact on revenue, operating margins, net income, financial position and cash flows.\nOur short-term and long-term sales forecast may not be accurate which could result in an adverse impact on our business.\nThe software business is generally characterized by long sales cycles. These long sales cycles increase the difficulty of predicting sales for any particular quarter. Many operational and strategic decisions are based upon short- and long-term sales forecasts. Our sales personnel continually monitor the status of proposals, including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale, in order to forecast quarterly sales. These forecasts are subject to significant estimation and are impacted by many external factors, including global economic conditions and the performance of our customers. A variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and, therefore, could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Management also forecasts macroeconomic trends and developments and integrates them through long-range planning into budgets, research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties. Global economic conditions, and the effect those conditions and any disruptions in global markets have on our customers, may have a significant impact on the accuracy of our sales forecasts. These conditions may increase the likelihood or the magnitude of variations between actual sales activity and our sales forecasts and, as a result, our performance may be hindered because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions. This, in turn, may adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. To the extent our forecasts are incorrect and, as a result, we fail to meet analyst expectations regarding financial performance or miss or reduce the financial guidance we give to investors, our share price may be adversely impacted.\nIntellectual Property and Cybersecurity Risks\nOur success is highly dependent upon the legal protection of our proprietary technology.\nWe primarily rely upon contracts and copyright, patent, trademark and trade secrets laws to protect our technology. We maintain intellectual property programs, including applying for patents, registering trademarks and copyrights, protecting trade secrets, entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees and channel partners, and limiting access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. However, software programs are particularly prone to piracy, which is a global phenomenon, and as a result we may lose revenue from the distribution of unlicensed software. Additionally, patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection do not provide the same coverage in every country in which we sell our products and services. Policing the unauthorized distribution and use of our products is difficult, and software piracy (including online piracy) is a persistent problem. While we continue to develop better mechanisms to detect and report or investigate unauthorized use of our software, we are also constrained by data privacy laws that restrict our ability to collect data about unlawful usage in some countries. We cannot assure that the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology are adequate to prevent misappropriation of our software by third parties, or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently. Despite our efforts to prevent such activities, we may nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software.\nCostly and time-consuming litigation would be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of trade secret rights and related confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions across our contractual agreements and partnerships. While we are not aware that any of our technology infringes upon the rights of third parties, there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert technology infringement claims against us, or that, if asserted, such claims will not prevail. Any such litigation could be costly to defend, damage our reputation, and distract our employees from their daily work. Any successful infringement claims asserted against us could require us to develop technology workarounds for the impacted products or product development, which could be costly, disrupt product development, and delay go-to-market activities. Such disruption and delay could negatively impact our financial results.\nCyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation.\nWhile we undertake commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and improve the security and integrity of our products, source code, computer systems and data with respect to the relative sensitivity of such software, systems and data, the number of computer \u201chackers\u201d developing and deploying destructive software programs that attack our products and computer systems continues to increase. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to enhance our cybersecurity efforts. Because the tactics and tools used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems are constantly evolving, we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures. Such an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our products, cause errors in the output of our customers' work, or allow unauthorized access to and disclosure of our sensitive, proprietary or confidential information or that of our customers and employees. In the event of a serious breach of our products or systems, or where a breach occurs due to our failure to implement reasonable and appropriate safeguards, our reputation may suffer, customers may stop buying products or may terminate current services, we could face lawsuits and potential civil liability, as well as regulatory fines and non-financial penalties for any personal data breach, and our financial performance could be negatively impacted.\nThere is also a danger of industrial espionage, cyberattacks, misuse, theft of information or assets (including source code), or damage to assets by people who have gained unauthorized access to our facilities, systems or information. This includes access to systems or information through email phishing attacks on our employees which has become a very prevalent technique used against companies, often delaying detection through increasingly complex practices. The objective of these attacks is often to acquire user account credentials in order to access other computer systems through linked accounts or where users have recycled passwords across systems.\nInadequate security practices or inadvertent acts or omissions by our employees and partners may also result in unauthorized access to our data. Employees or third parties may also intentionally compromise our or our customers\u2019 security or systems. Such cybersecurity breaches, misuse of data or other disruptions could lead to loss of or unauthorized disclosure of our source code or other confidential information, unlicensed use and distribution of our products without compensation, illegal use of our products that could jeopardize the security of customer information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems, and theft, manipulation and destruction of proprietary data, resulting in defective products, performance downtimes and possible violation of export laws and other regulatory compliance requirements. Although we actively employ measures to combat such activities, preventing unauthorized access to our systems and data is inherently difficult. In addition, litigation to either pursue our legal rights or defend any claims against us could be costly and time-consuming and may divert management's attention and adversely affect the market's perception of us and our products.\nWe have experienced targeted and non-targeted cybersecurity attacks and incidents in the past that have resulted in unauthorized persons gaining access to our information and systems, and we could in the future experience similar attacks. To date, no cybersecurity incident or attack has had a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nA number of our core processes, such as software development, sales and marketing, customer service and financial transactions, rely on IT infrastructure and applications. We also rely on third-party service providers and products, which are exposed to various security vulnerabilities outside of our control. Malicious software, sabotage and other cybersecurity breaches of the types discussed above could cause an outage of our infrastructure, which could cause short-term disruption in operations or, in the event of a longer disruption, lead to a substantial denial of service to our customers and ultimately to production downtime, recovery costs and customer claims for breach of contract, as well as reputational damage and impact to employee morale and productivity.\nWe rely on service providers for infrastructure and cloud-based products.\nWe use a number of third-party service providers for key components of our infrastructure, particularly with respect to development and delivery of our cloud-based products. The utilization of these service providers gives us greater flexibility in efficiently delivering a more tailored, scalable customer experience but also exposes us to additional risks and vulnerabilities. Those of our products and services that depend upon hosted components delivered by third parties are vulnerable to security risks inherent in web-based technologies, including greater risk of unauthorized access to or use of customers\u2019 protected data. Interception of data transmission, misappropriation or modification of data, corruption of data and attacks by bad actors against our service providers may also adversely affect our products or product and service delivery. Malicious code, viruses or vulnerabilities that are undetected by our service providers may disrupt our business operations generally and may have a disproportionate effect on those of our products that are developed and delivered in the cloud environment. These risks, though largely outside our control, may impact customer perception of our products, service and support, and may damage our brand. While we devote resources to maintaining the security and integrity of our products and systems, as well as ensuring adequate due diligence for our third-party service providers, cloud security and reliability is inherently challenging. In the event of a material breach of data hosted by our service providers or a serious security incident on behalf of, caused by or experienced by a service provider, we may experience significant operational and technical difficulties, loss of data including customer data, diminished competitive position or reputation, and loss of customer engagement, which could result in civil liabilities and a negative impact to financial performance.\nFinancial Risks\nOur revenue is subject to increased volatility due to the adoption of a new revenue recognition accounting standard on January 1, 2018.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09). We adopted ASU 2014-09 and its related amendments (collectively known as Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606) on January 1, 2018 which significantly impacted the timing, allocation and presentation of our lease license, perpetual license and maintenance revenue. Under previous revenue guidance, revenue was recognized ratably from the sale of software lease licenses and software maintenance subscriptions. However, under ASC 606, the license component of lease revenue is recognized up front. The post-contract support portion of lease license contracts continues to be recognized over the contract term, but it is now allocated to maintenance and service revenue.\nWe continue to sell perpetual licenses that involve the payment of a single, upfront fee. Historically, these licenses have been more typical in the computer software industry and remain as the preferred licensing approach in certain markets. The revenue associated with perpetual licenses continues to be recognized up front, consistent with prior revenue guidance.\nThe adoption of this revenue recognition guidance, coupled with our continued sales of perpetual licenses, creates the likelihood for software license revenue volatility to increase across periods, particularly as compared to our results under the previous revenue recognition standard. Our revenue in any period will depend significantly on sales contracts completed during that period.\nChanges in existing financial accounting standards could adversely impact our financial results and operations.\nChanges in existing accounting rules or practices, new accounting pronouncements, or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business.\nIn addition, we could incur significant costs for changes to our business systems, processes and internal controls as a result of the transition. These costs could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. The transition could also cause management to divert time from day-to-day operations, which could impact our business. If we are unable to successfully transition our business systems, processes and internal controls before the guidance effective date, it could impact our ability to meet financial reporting deadlines. For further information on the impact of recently issued accounting guidance, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges to tax laws, variable tax estimates and tax authority audits could impact our financial results and operations.\nOur operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the U.S. and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. A change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business, including an increase in tax rates, an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, or a decrease in tax rates in a jurisdiction in which we have significant deferred tax assets, could result in a material increase in tax expense. Furthermore, we have recorded significant deferred tax liabilities related to acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for tax purposes. These deferred tax liabilities are based on future statutory tax rates in the locations in which the intangible assets are recorded. Any future changes in statutory tax rates would be recorded as an adjustment to the deferred tax liabilities in the period the change is announced and could have a material impact on our effective tax rate during that period.\nWe also make significant estimates in determining our worldwide income tax provision. These estimates involve complex tax regulations in many jurisdictions and are subject to many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the periods in which such determinations are made.\nThe amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. These audits can result in additional assessments, including interest and penalties. Our estimates for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions is highly judgmental and actual future outcomes may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities, including estimates for uncertain tax positions, in the period the assessments are made or resolved, audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn connection with our acquisition of LST, we borrowed $500.0 million under a term loan facility which matures on November 1, 2024. We also have access to a $500.0 million revolving credit facility, which includes a $50.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. The credit agreement governing these loans contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The credit agreement also contains a financial covenant requiring us\nto maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization not exceeding 3.50 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter (for the four-quarter period ending on such date) with an opportunity for a temporary increase in such consolidated leverage ratio to 4.00 to 1.00 upon the consummation of certain qualified acquisitions for which the aggregate consideration is at least $250.0 million.\nNotwithstanding the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our credit facility, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our level of debt could intensify. Specifically, our level of debt could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations and other ongoing business obligations, which may result in defaults;\n\u2022\nresult in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the agreement governing our debt, which could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable or require us to negotiate an amendment to financial or other covenants that could cause us to incur additional fees and expenses;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nreduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under the credit facility, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industries in which we operate, and the overall economy;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nincrease our cost of borrowing.\nAny of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt agreements.\nFurthermore, borrowings under the credit agreement use the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR has been the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, and the financial industry is currently transitioning away from LIBOR as a benchmark for the interbank lending market. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness.", "PERMNO": 83621, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "ANSS"}
