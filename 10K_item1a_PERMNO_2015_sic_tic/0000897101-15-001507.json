Risk Factors\nThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our global operations that involve the manufacturing and sale of products for highly demanding Customer applications throughout the world. These risks and uncertainties could adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition. The following discussion, along with discussions elsewhere in this report, outlines the risks and uncertainties that we believe are the most material to our business at this time. We want to further highlight the risks and uncertainties associated with: world economic factors and ongoing global economic uncertainty, currency fluctuations, commodity prices, political factors, our international operations, the continued implementation of our global ERP information technology system and other new information technology systems, information security and data breaches, the reduced demand for hard disk drive products with the increased use of flash memory, highly competitive markets, governmental laws and regulations, including the impact of the various economic stimulus and financial reform measures, potential global events resulting in market instability including financial bailouts and defaults of sovereign nations, military and terrorist activities, including conditions where we do business, other political changes, health outbreaks, natural disasters, and other factors discussed below. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nOperating internationally carries risks which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nWe have sales and manufacturing operations throughout the world, with the heaviest concentrations in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Our stability, growth, and profitability are subject to a number of risks of doing business internationally that could harm our business, including:\n\u00b7 political and military events,\n\u00b7 legal and regulatory requirements, including import, export, defense regulations, anti-corruption laws, and foreign exchange controls,\n\u00b7 tariffs and trade barriers,\n\u00b7 potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations,\n\u00b7 credit risk of local Customers and distributors,\n\u00b7 difficulties in protecting our intellectual property,\n\u00b7 local economic, political, and social conditions, specifically in the Middle East, Ukraine, China, Thailand, and other emerging markets where we do business,\n\u00b7 trade restrictions in Latin American countries, specifically Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela,\n\u00b7 potential global health outbreaks, and\n\u00b7 natural disasters.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations. Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation, and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the\nUnited States (U.S.). In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business, and results of operations or financial condition.\nMaintaining a competitive advantage requires continuing investment with uncertain returns.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and have numerous competitors who may already be well-established in those markets. We expect our competitors to continue improving the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products that could be competitive in both price and performance. We believe that we have certain technological advantages over our competitors, but maintaining these advantages requires us to continually invest in research and development, sales and marketing, and Customer service and support. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in maintaining these advantages. We make investments in new technologies that address increased performance and regulatory requirements around the globe. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in completing development or achieving sales of these products or that the margins on such products will be acceptable. Our financial performance may be negatively impacted if a competitor\u2019s successful product innovation reaches the market before ours or gains broader market acceptance.\nWe may be adversely impacted by changes in technology that could reduce or eliminate the demand for our products. These risks include:\n\u00b7 breakthroughs in technology which provide a viable alternative to diesel engines\n\u00b7 reduced demand for hard disk drive products by flash memory or a similar technology, which would reduce the use of hard disk drives and therefore reduce the need for our filtration solutions in these disk drives\n\u00b7 other breakthroughs in filtration technologies that could displace our products\nDifficulties with our information technology systems and security could adversely affect our results.\nWe have many information technology systems that are important to the operation of our businesses, some of which are managed by third parties. These systems are used to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems, maintaining and upgrading our existing systems, and preventing information security breaches. There may be other risks as we continue our multi-year implementation of an enterprise resource planning system (Global ERP Project) on a worldwide basis. Such difficulties could lead to significant additional expenses and/or disruption in business operations that could adversely affect our results. Additionally, information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. Should such an attack succeed, it could lead to the compromising of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes, and operations disruptions. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation, and could result in litigation, regulatory action, potential liability, and increased costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection matters.\nDemand for our products relies on economic and industrial conditions worldwide.\nChanges in economic or industrial conditions could impact our results or financial condition in any particular period as our business can be sensitive to varying conditions by region across the globe.\nNo Customer accounted for ten percent or more of our net sales in Fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013. A number of our Customers are concentrated in similar cyclical industries (construction, agriculture, and mining), resulting in additional risk based on industrial conditions in those sectors.\nWe participate in highly competitive markets with pricing pressure. If we are not able to compete effectively our margins and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe businesses and product lines in which we participate are very competitive and we risk losing business based on a wide range of factors including technology, price, geographic coverage, product performance, and Customer\nservice. Large Customers continue to seek productivity gains and lower prices from us and their other suppliers. We may lose business or negatively impact our margins if we are unable to deliver the best value to our Customers.\nChanges in our product mix impact our financial performance.\nWe sell products that have varying profit margins. Our financial performance can be impacted depending on the mix of products we sell during a given period. Our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales. If actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales, our results could be negatively impacted.\nUnavailable or higher cost materials could impact our financial performance.\nWe obtain raw materials including steel, filter media, petroleum-based products, and other components from third-party suppliers and tend to carry limited raw material inventories. An unanticipated delay in delivery by our suppliers could result in the inability to deliver on-time and meet the expectations of our Customers. This could negatively affect our financial performance. An increase in commodity prices could also result in lower operating margins.\nAn unfavorable fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively impacts our results and financial position.\nWe have operations in many countries, with more than one-half of our annual revenue coming from countries outside of the United States. Each of our subsidiaries reports its results of operations and financial position in its relevant functional currency, which is then translated into U.S. dollars. This translated financial information is included in our consolidated financial statements. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the foreign currencies of our subsidiaries has a negative impact on our results and financial position.\nAcquisitions may have an impact on our results.\nWe have made and continue to pursue acquisitions, including our acquisitions of Northern Technical L.L.C. and IFIL USA L.L.C. in Fiscal 2015. These acquisitions could negatively impact our profitability due to operating and integration inefficiencies, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. There are also a number of other risks involved in acquisitions. We could lose key existing Customers, have difficulties in assimilating the acquired operations, assume unanticipated legal liabilities, or lose key Employees.\nCosts associated with lawsuits or investigations may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to many laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We routinely incur costs in order to comply with these laws and regulations. We may be adversely impacted by new or changing laws and regulations that affect both our operations and our ability to develop and sell products that meet our Customers\u2019 requirements. We are involved in various product liability, product warranty, intellectual property, environmental claims, and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. It is not possible to predict the outcome of investigations and lawsuits, and we could incur judgments, fines, or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition in any particular period.\nAdditional tax expense or tax exposure could impact our financial performance.\nWe are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws and regulations. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities. The results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.\nCompliance with environmental and product laws and regulations can be costly.\nWe are subject to many environmental and product laws and regulations in the jurisdiction we operate. We routinely incur costs in order to comply with these laws and regulations. We may be adversely impacted by new or changing laws and regulations that affect both our operations and our ability to develop and sell products that meet our Customers\u2019 requirements.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and prevent material fraud, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting resulted in a material weakness during fiscal 2015.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent and detect material fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent or detect material fraud, our operating results could be misstated. In connection with reporting our results for fiscal 2015, we discovered that certain employees in our European Gas Turbine Products business falsified documents in a manner that caused revenue to be recorded in inappropriate periods during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and the second and third quarters of fiscal 2015. Due to the inappropriate acceleration of revenue in the aforementioned periods, revenue was also misstated in the first and fourth quarters of 2015. The recording of revenue in inappropriate periods was the result of a control deficiency which constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. There was also an indication that there may have been purposeful deferring of certain charges from suppliers to later time periods than appropriate, however, these allegations were not substantiated through the independent investigation performed. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has determined that the misstatements in revenue were not material to the impacted periods. Although we are taking remedial actions in response to our discovery of these practices, including the termination of certain employees, there can be no assurances that we will be able to prevent future control deficiencies (including material weaknesses) from occurring and which could cause us to incur unforeseen costs, negatively impact our results of operations, cause the market price of our common stock to decline, or have other potential adverse consequences.", "PERMNO": 61313, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "DCI"}
