{"cik": "1639691", "company": "LivaNova PLC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investor should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe the following information identifies the most significant risks affecting us, but the risks and uncertainties included below are not the only ones related to our businesses. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\nRisks Relating to the Company\nThe global medical device industry is highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete effectively.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market characterized by increasingly complex products that are expensive and time consuming to develop and manufacture. In the product lines in which we compete, we face a mixture of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of specialized products. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes, or technologies, may make our products or proposed products less competitive. In addition, we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies and providers of cannabis derived products, among others. Competitive factors include: product quality, reliability and performance; product technology; breadth of product lines and product services; ability to identify new market trends; customer support and training; price; capacity to recruit engineers, scientists and other qualified employees; and reimbursement approval. Difficulties in any of these areas may cause our operations and financial condition to suffer.\nReductions or interruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products may adversely affect our financial condition and business operations, particularly in the wake of COVID-19.\nWe maintain manufacturing operations in five countries located throughout the world and purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing these products from numerous suppliers in various countries. Any problem affecting a supplier (whether due to external or internal causes) could have a negative impact on us.\nIn limited cases, specific components and raw materials are purchased from primary or main suppliers (or in some cases, a single or sole supplier) for reasons related to quality assurance, cost-effectiveness ratio and availability. While we work closely with our suppliers to ensure supply continuity, minimize the instances in which we rely on a sole supplier and take other countermeasures to reduce our supply chain risk, we cannot guarantee that our efforts will always be successful. Moreover, due to strict standards and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of our products, we may not be able to locate new supply sources quickly or at all in response to a supply reduction or interruption, with negative effects on our ability to manufacture our products effectively and timely.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this risk by negatively impacting the global economy, by, among other things, causing global supply chain shortages. Increased demand and low capacity worldwide have caused longer lead times and put price pressure on key raw materials. We are managing our supply chain by giving long visibility to our suppliers, conducting regular supply critical risk reviews and closely monitoring our inventory, among other things, but any problem could quickly, negatively reverberate throughout the organization. While we have not experienced any material supply chain issues as a result of the pandemic to date, we continue to monitor the landscape closely.\nOur products are subject to complex laws and regulations, and failure to obtain product approvals or clearance may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nOur medical devices and technologies, as well as our business activities, are subject to a complex set of regulations and rigorous enforcement, including by the FDA, U.S. Department of Justice, Health and Human Services - Office of the Inspector General, and numerous other federal, state, and non-U.S. governmental authorities. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our products. As a part of the marketing clearance or approval process for new products and new indications for existing products, we conduct numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials, or the markets\u2019 or FDA\u2019s perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals. Currently, for example, we are conducting the RECOVER study and the ANTHEM and OSPREY trials - any delays or news regarding unfavorable or inconsistent data could have a material adverse effect on our business. Nevertheless, success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical studies does not always ensure that later clinical studies will be successful, and we cannot be sure that later studies will replicate the results of prior studies. Any delay or termination of our clinical studies will delay the filing of product submissions and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize new products or product modifications. It is also possible that\npatients enrolled in clinical studies will experience adverse side effects that are not currently part of the product\u2019s profile, which could inhibit further marketing and development of such products.\nEven if we are able to obtain approval or clearance, it may take a significant amount of time; require the expenditure of substantial resources; involve stringent clinical and pre-clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance; and involve modifications, repairs or replacements of our products or limit the proposed uses of our products. Ultimately, we cannot guarantee that our clinical trials will be successful or that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for new products or modifications to existing products, and any such issues, whether in relation to trials, approvals or clearances, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFailure to comply with product-related government regulations may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nBoth before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA and other applicable non-U.S. government agency regulations. For instance, many of our facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, which can result in inspectional observations on FDA\u2019s Form-483, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such medical products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to grant pending PMA applications or require certificates of non-U.S. governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. In 2015, we received a warning letter from the FDA alleging certain violations of FDA regulations, which resulted in certain devices that were manufactured in Munich, Germany, to be denied admission to the U.S. until resolution of the issues set forth by the FDA in the warning letter. See \u201cNote 13. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. While we work diligently to manage our ongoing responsibilities, the FDA and other non-U.S. government agencies could assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis. The FDA could also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. An adverse regulatory action could restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products, limit our ability to obtain future pre-market clearances or PMAs, and result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. These potential consequences, as well as any adverse outcome from government investigations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nIn addition, in the U.S., device manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products other than for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling (so called \u201coff-label uses\u201d). Our VNS Therapy System, for example, is indicated in the U.S., as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in patients 4 years of age and older with partial onset seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic medications, yet a number of physicians elect to prescribe our device for certain patients suffering from generalized seizures. While physicians may exercise their discretion in prescribing a device off-label, any failure on the part of the device manufacturer to comply with off-label regulations could subject us to significant civil or criminal exposure, administrative obligations and costs, and/or other potential penalties from, and/or agreements with, the federal government.\nGovernmental regulations outside the U.S. have, and may continue to become, increasingly stringent and common. In the EU, for example, Reg MDR (Medical Device Regulation) became effective in May 2021, resulting in significant additional premarket and post-market requirements which must be in place by May 2024. During this transition period, the European Commission is allowing companies to use their MDD (Medical Device Directive) certifications. LivaNova is working to obtain all appropriate approvals and intends to be fully compliant by the May 2024 deadline, as penalties for regulatory non-compliance can be severe, including fines and revocation or suspension of a company\u2019s business license, mandatory price reductions and criminal sanctions.\nIf our marketed medical devices are defective or otherwise pose safety risks, the FDA and similar non-U.S. governmental authorities could require their recall or initiate an enforcement action, or we may initiate a recall of our products voluntarily.\nThe FDA and similar non-U.S. governmental authorities may require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design, software or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. Manufacturers, on their own initiative, may recall a product with a material deficiency, and we have initiated voluntary product recalls in the past. Any recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our revenue. A recall could also impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner. In the\nfuture, we may initiate voluntary withdrawal, removal or repair actions that we determine do not require notification as a recall. If a regulating authority were to disagree with our determinations, it could require us to report those actions as recalls.\nIn addition, depending on the corrective action taken to redress a device\u2019s deficiencies or defects, regulators may require, or we may decide, that we need to obtain new approvals or clearances for the device before we market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such approvals or clearances may delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, or litigation, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating the business, and may harm our reputation and financial results. Moreover, if we do not adequately address problems associated with our devices, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including FDA warning letters, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties, or civil or criminal fines, and or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs a manufacturer of medical devices, we are exposed to product liability claims that could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and tarnish our reputation.\nWe manufacture and sell medical devices, both equipment and implantables, that pose product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of such devices. Component failures, manufacturing defects, software errors, design flaws or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information with respect to these or other products we manufacture or sell could result in an unsafe condition, injury to, or death of, a patient. Such an event could result in product liability claims or a recall of, or safety alert relating to, one or more of our products. We have elected to self-insure with respect to a significant portion of our product liability risks and also hold global insurance policies to cover a portion of future potential losses. Product liability claims or product recalls in the future, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers for our products, and losses from product liability claims in the future could exceed our product liability insurance coverage and lead to a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, future unanticipated large liability claims may raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs described in \u201cNote 13. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are involved in product liability litigation that may adversely affect our financial condition and may require us to devote significant resources to our defense of these claims. This product liability litigation relates to our cardiopulmonary 3T Heater-Cooler product, and as of March 1, 2022, we are aware of approximately 90 filed and unfiled claims worldwide, with the majority of the claims filed in various federal or state courts throughout the U.S. Although we are defending these matters vigorously, the outcome of such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGlobal healthcare policy changes and tightening of reimbursement for products may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn response to increases in healthcare costs, there have been and continue to be proposals by governments, regulators and third-party payors to control these costs. These proposals have resulted in efforts to enact healthcare system reforms that may lead to pricing restrictions, limits on the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and limits on the acceptance and use of our products. Our ability to commercialize our products is dependent, in large part, on whether third-party payors, including private healthcare insurers, managed care plans, governmental programs and others agree to cover the costs and services associated with our products and related procedures in the U.S. and internationally. Similarly, periodic changes to reimbursement methodologies could have an adverse impact on our business. Adoption of some or all of such healthcare policy and reimbursement proposals could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with rules relating to reimbursement of healthcare goods and services, healthcare fraud and abuse, false claims and other applicable laws or regulations may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation and business operations.\nOur devices and therapies are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies worldwide responsible for coverage, reimbursement and regulation of healthcare goods and services, including laws and regulations related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and health care fraud. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties.\nThe risk of being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our relationships with surgeons and other healthcare providers, some of whom recommend, purchase and/or prescribe our devices, group purchasing organizations and our independent sales agents and distributors, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Even an allegation of impropriety could adversely impact our reputation and/or business operations.\nCyber-attacks or other disruptions to our information technology systems could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, fines, harm to our competitive position and loss of reputation.\nWe are increasingly dependent on our information technology systems and those of third parties to operate our business, and certain products of ours include integrated software and information technology. COVID-19 has exacerbated such dependencies due to the challenges in managing such a vast employee population working remotely. We rely on information technology systems to collect and process customer orders, manage product manufacturing and shipping and support regulatory compliance, and we routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data, including sensitive personal information, patient health information and confidential business information. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations but the size and complexity of our products and the information technology systems on which we rely make them vulnerable to cyber-attacks, breakdown, interruptions, destruction, loss or compromise of data, obsolescence or incompatibility among systems or other significant disruptions. Unauthorized persons routinely attempt to access our products or systems in order to disrupt, disable or degrade such products or services, to obtain proprietary or confidential information, to make ransom demands, or to remotely disrupt or access the systems of large health care providers by exploiting our products or systems. We maintain an information security risk insurance policy and continue to enhance our information security programs. While we have not fallen victim to any material cyber-attacks, such an incident or an incident at a third-party vendor could compromise our networks and our information could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. The negative publicity resulting from such disruptions could significantly impact our reputation and stock price, and the financial consequences could have a material effect on our business.\nIn addition, from time to time, we may acquire new businesses. As a result of acquisitions, we may face risks due to implementation, modification, or remediation of controls, procedures and policies relating to data privacy and cybersecurity at the acquired company. We continue to consolidate and over time integrate the number of systems we operate, and to upgrade and expand our information system capabilities for stable and secure business operations. There can be no assurance that our process of consolidating, protecting, upgrading and expanding our systems and capabilities, continuing to build security into the design of our products, and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. Similarly, we may divest and have divested portions of our business, resulting in the migration of data and overlapping data obligations. As a result of such divestitures, we may face risks due to migration or modification of controls, procedures and policies relating to data privacy and cybersecurity internally or enroute. Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, corruption or destruction of these systems, as well as any data breaches, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe costs of complying with the requirements of federal, state and foreign laws pertaining to the privacy and security of personal information, including health related information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThere is significant regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the U.S. (at both the state and federal level) and abroad, and an actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable U.S. or foreign data protection regulations or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation (including, in some instances, class action litigation), fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. This regulatory environment is increasingly challenging and may present material obligations and risks to our business, including significantly expanded compliance burdens, costs and enforcement risks. If we are unable to maintain secure, reliable information technology systems and prevent data breaches, we may suffer legal and regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences. Our worldwide operations mean that we are subject to data protection and cyber-security laws and regulations in many jurisdictions. For example, if we are in breach of the GDPR\u2019s or CCPA\u2019s requirement that we ensure a level of security, both in terms of technology and other organizational measures, appropriate to the risk that the confidentiality, integrity or availability of personally identifiable data is compromised, we could be subject to fines and enforcement actions. Violations of GDPR can result in fines of as much as 4% of a company\u2019s annual revenue. Other governments have enacted or are enacting similar data protection laws, including data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders. Despite programs to comply with such laws and regulations and our purchase of a cyber insurance policy, there is no guarantee that we will avoid enforcement actions by governmental bodies. Enforcement actions may be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business. In addition, there is a trend of civil lawsuits and class actions relating to breaches of consumer data or other cyber-attacks pursuant to laws such as CCPA. While we have not been named in any such lawsuits, if a breach or loss of data occurs, we could become a target of civil litigation or government enforcement actions.\nQuality problems with our processes, goods, and services could harm our reputation for producing high-quality products and erode our competitive advantage, sales, and market share.\nQuality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure. Our quality certifications are critical to the marketing success of our goods and services. If we fail to meet these standards, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose customers, and our revenue and results of operations could decline. Aside from specific customer standards, our success depends generally on our ability to manufacture precision-engineered components, sub-assemblies, and finished products to exact tolerances and from multiple materials. If our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards, our reputation as a manufacturer of high-quality components will be harmed, our competitive advantage could be damaged, and we could lose customers and market share.\nWe cannot guarantee that our internal R&D efforts and those R&D efforts that rely on investments and investment collaborations will be successful.\nOur strategy to provide a broad range of therapies to restore patients to fuller, healthier lives requires a wide variety of technologies, products and capabilities. The rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions. As a result, we also rely on investments and investment collaborations to provide us access to new technologies both in areas served by our existing or legacy businesses as well as in new areas.\nIf we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis, our offerings will become obsolete over time and our business and financial results could be negatively impacted. Our success depends on several factors, including our ability to appropriately allocate our R&D funding to products and services with higher growth prospects, for example, further incorporation of software; hire and retain the necessary R&D talent; stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies; innovate and develop new technologies and applications; and acquire or obtain third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in the markets that we serve.\nWe expect to make investments where we believe that we can stimulate the development of, or acquire new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses. Investments and investment collaborations in and with medical technology companies are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any of our previous or future acquisitions, investments or investment collaborations will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our consolidated earnings, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, and non-disclosure and non-competition agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we will continue to do so. While we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, any litigation to counter the infringement, misappropriation, or unauthorized use of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, which may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, our patents, trade secrets, or other agreements may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling similar products and services and may not adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of our technology. Further, pending patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us. Patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology and may limit our competitive advantage. Third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nWe also rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with certain employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge.\nWe operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation and are subject to patent claims from time to time. While we intend to defend against any third-party intellectual property threats, intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable. Such litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected products or require us to pay significant royalties in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected products.\nIn addition, the laws and intellectual property systems of certain countries in which we market some of our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the U.S., which may impact our market position in those countries. We could also face competition in countries where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio, or where we have not invested in the same protection as in the U.S. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property in those countries, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations and the risk of environmental liabilities, violations and litigation in multiple jurisdictions, including in Saluggia, where we are currently involved in the disposal of hazardous substances and in Italy in relation to SNIA\u2019s environmental liabilities.\nOur operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily those used in manufacturing and sterilization processes in the various jurisdictions where we operate. In addition, certain environmental laws assess liability on current, prior and/or related owners or operators of real property for the costs or investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties on which they have disposed of hazardous substances. For example, our Saluggia campus contains hazardous substances as a result of nuclear installations, built in 1960 under previous ownership, and the Italian Government has stated that we will eventually be responsible for dismantling the nuclear installation on Company property, which will involve cleaning and dismantling contaminated buildings and equipment as well as delivering the aforementioned waste to a national repository. We have recognized a liability of $39.3 million as of December 31, 2021. In addition, as described in \u201cNote 13. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K along with the aforementioned matter, we are currently in litigation with the government in Italy stemming from a civil action where the Court of Appeal in Milan (Court of Appeal) declared LivaNova (formed through a merger with Sorin) jointly liable with SNIA (a former parent company of Sorin) for environmental liabilities incurred by SNIA\u2019s other subsidiaries. In November 2021, the Court of Appeal delivered the remainder of the decision, demanding that LivaNova pay damages of approximately \u20ac453.6 million (approximately $514.6 million as of December 31, 2021). LivaNova appealed both the liability and damages decisions, and they will be decided together at the Italian Supreme Court. In February 2022, the Court of Appeal granted a stay on the demand for payment from the Public Administrations pending resolution of the Company\u2019s appeal on liability and damages. The stay was granted with the condition that the Company provide a first demand bank surety of \u20ac270.0 million (approximately $306.2 million as of December 31, 2021) within 30 calendar days. For additional information, please refer to \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d within \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our liquidity, business operations or results of operations could be adversely affected by a negative decision in the case of SNIA or increase in anticipated costs relating to transportation of hazardous waste in Saluggia.\nIt is also possible that, a governmental authority may seek to hold us liable for successor liability violations committed by any companies in which we invest or that we acquire. Finally, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. The ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing or future cash outflows is difficult to predict, given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup and the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations. The costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, or liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, may exceed our estimates, or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally.\nWe develop, manufacture, distribute and sell our products globally and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities worldwide. Our international operations are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business globally and under non-U.S. laws, regulations and customs. These risks include possible nationalization, invasions, wars, negative consequences associated with Brexit, expropriation, importation limitations, pricing restrictions, government shutdowns and violations of laws. On February 24, 2022, for example, Russia launched an invasion in Ukraine which has the potential to affect our ability to import certain materials used to manufacture our products and sell our products in these countries. Our profitability and operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including: local product preferences and product requirements; longer-term receivables than are typical in the EU or the U.S.; difficulty enforcing agreements; creditworthiness of customers; trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements; imposition of sanctions; different labor regulations and workforce instability; higher danger of terrorist activity, war or civil unrest; selling our products through distributors and agents; political and economic instability; and the risks further described below in the section entitled \u201cThe failure to comply with anti-bribery laws could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil and/or criminal sanctions.\u201d Any of the aforementioned risks could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions, including Iran, Sudan, and Syria. These business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income, but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations. Violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restriction of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows.\nOur functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, a portion of the revenues earned and expenses incurred by certain of our subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We determine the functional currency of our subsidiaries that exist and operate in different economic and currency environments based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates, that is, the currency of the environment in which an entity primarily generates and expends cash. For transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies, fluctuations in the exchange rate will impact our results of operations and financial condition. Although we may elect to hedge certain foreign currency exposure, we cannot be certain that the hedging activity will eliminate our currency risk.\nIn addition, in many of the countries where we operate, employees are covered by various laws and/or collective bargaining agreements that endow them, through their local or national representatives, with the right to be consulted in relation to specific issues, including the downsizing or closing of departments and staff reductions. The laws and/or collective bargaining agreements that are applicable to these agreements could have an impact on our flexibility, as they apply to programs to redefine and/or strategically reposition our activities. Our ability to implement staff downsizing programs or even temporary interruptions of employment relationships is predicated on the approval of government entities and the consent of labor unions. A negative response from a works council or union-organized work stoppages by employees could have a negative impact on our business.\nCOVID-19 has had, and we expect will continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, the nature and extent of which are uncertain and unpredictable.\nThe continuing global spread of COVID-19 and its variants, including corresponding preventative and precautionary measures that we and other businesses, communities and governments are taking to mitigate the spread of the disease, has led to unprecedented restrictions on, disruptions in, and other related impacts on business. COVID-19 is affecting our employees, customers, facilities, communities and business operations, as well as the global economy and financial markets. As the COVID-19 crisis continues to evolve, the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. In addition to travel restrictions, countries, states and governments may continue to close borders, impose prolonged quarantines or other restrictions and requirements on travel, and further limit our ability to conduct business in-person as we did prior to COVID-19.\nWhile we are seeing improvement, we continue to experience ongoing COVID-19 related headwinds and are monitoring the potential for various strains of the virus to cause a resumption of high levels of infection and hospitalization, that in turn, may affect the demand for our products. In certain geographies, hospital systems continue to prioritize treatment of COVID-19 patients and otherwise comply with government guidelines, thereby resulting in the suspension or cancellation of elective medical procedures, which has caused a reduction in sales of these products. To the extent individuals and hospital systems continue to de-prioritize, delay or cancel these procedures, or if unemployment or loss of insurance coverage adversely impacts an individual\u2019s ability to pay for our products and services, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations will continue to be negatively affected. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic is straining hospital systems around the world, resulting in adverse financial impacts to those systems that could result in reduced future expenditures for our products. While our clinical trials have resumed, we continue to monitor relevant conditions as there can be no assurance that there will not be delays or closures of sites in the future should COVID-19 or variants thereof strengthen or reemerge.\nWhile the industry has experienced supply chain, labor shortage, inflation and logistical issues in the wake of COVID-19, to date, the supply of raw materials and the production and distribution of finished products within LivaNova remain operational with no material constraints. Regardless, there can be no assurance that any negative impacts from supply chain, staffing shortages, inflation or logistics would not adversely affect our operating results. All of our manufacturing plants have been able to remain open during COVID-19. Regardless, there can be no assurance that any of our facilities will not need to shut down in the future as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the global economy and capital markets, including by negatively impacting demand for our products and foreign currency exchange rates, each of which may adversely impact our business. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the volatile global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could precipitate or amplify the other risk factors that we identify here. We could experience loss of sales and profits due to delayed payments or insolvency of healthcare professionals, hospitals and other customers, suppliers and vendors facing liquidity issues. As a result, we may be compelled to take additional measures to preserve our cash flow.\nFinally, COVID-19 could adversely impact our ability to retain key employees and the continued service and availability of skilled personnel necessary to run our productions and operations, including our executive officers and other members of our management team, as well as the ability of our third-party suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and vendors to retain their key employees. To the extent our management or other personnel are impacted in significant numbers by COVID-19 and are not available to perform their job duties, we could experience delays in, or the suspension of, our manufacturing operations, research and product development activities, regulatory work streams, clinical development programs and other important commercial functions.\nWhile the impact of COVID-19 has had, and we expect it to continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, the nature and extent of such impact is uncertain and unpredictable. For more information on the impact of COVID-19 on the Company and LivaNova\u2019s mitigation measures, please refer to \u201cRecent Developments Regarding COVID-19\u201d within \u201cNote 1. Nature of Operations,\u201d and \u201cCOVID-19\u201d under \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nThe failure to comply with anti-bribery laws could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil and/or criminal sanctions.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the UK Bribery Act, FCPA and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business, that generally prohibit us and our employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. Because of the predominance of government-administered healthcare systems in many parts of the world outside the U.S., many of our customer relationships are potentially subject to such laws.\nWe are, therefore, exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors, independent sales agents and distributors may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity in violation of these laws and our Code of Conduct. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations.\nGlobal enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased substantially in recent years, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by governmental agencies, and assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. Any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities, including exclusion from government contracting or government healthcare programs, and could negatively affect our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition.\nThe impact of pending or existing climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere could present major risks to our future operations.\nThe physical impacts of natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires or flooding could pose physical risks to our facilities, disrupt our supply chain operations, and negatively impact operational costs. In addition, as new legal and regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment are increasing, they may impose legal or regulatory requirements which may increase our compliance burdens and costs to meet these obligations. Individually or in the aggregate, such risks could materially negatively impact our future operations.\nOur inability to integrate recently acquired businesses or to successfully complete and integrate future acquisitions could limit our future growth or otherwise be disruptive to our ongoing business.\nFrom time to time, we acquire businesses and may pursue acquisitions in support of our strategic goals. There can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will be available on acceptable terms or at all, or that we will be able to obtain necessary financing or regulatory approvals to complete potential acquisitions. The success of any acquisition, investment or\nalliance may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquire into our existing business. The integration of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts, including the coordination of information technologies, human resources, R&D, sales and marketing, operations, manufacturing, legal, compliance and finance. These efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of management\u2019s time that cannot then be dedicated to other projects. Failure to manage and coordinate the growth of the combined company successfully could also have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, we cannot be certain that our investments, alliances and acquired businesses will become profitable or remain so. If our investments, alliances or acquisitions are not successful, we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate.\nWe may incur impairments of intangible assets and goodwill, primarily acquired in acquisitions, that may adversely affect our financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our net intangible assets and goodwill totaled $1.3 billion, which represents 59.0% of our total assets. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement for the divestiture of certain of LivaNova\u2019s subsidiaries as well as certain other assets and liabilities relating to the Company\u2019s Heart Valve business that resulted in an impairment of the Heart Valves disposal group of $180.2 million and a $21.3 million impairment to the goodwill. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we determined that the In Process Research and Development (\u201cIPR&D\u201d) asset relating to ImThera was impaired and as a result, recorded an impairment of $50.3 million, and we also fully impaired the goodwill and the IPR&D asset associated with the discontinuation of the Caisson business by recording a $42.4 million impairment to goodwill and a $89.0 million impairment to the IPR&D asset.\nWe review, when circumstances warrant, the carrying amounts of our intangible assets to determine whether those carrying amounts continue to be recoverable in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our businesses, significant unexpected or planned changes in the use of assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines, among other events, may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets. Recent impairments have significantly affected our financial results and future impairments could significantly affect reported financial results.\nThe closing of the proposed sale of LivaNova Site Management (\u201cLSM\u201d) in the context of the Heart Valves business divestment is subject to a number of conditions, satisfaction of which are beyond our control and there can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied or that the divestiture of LSM will be completed.\nOn December 2, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement, amended and restated on April 9, 2021, with Mitral Holdco S.\u00e0 r.l., a company incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and wholly owned and controlled by funds advised by Gyrus Capital S.A., a Swiss private equity firm, which provides for the divestiture of LivaNova\u2019s Heart Valve business, as well as site management operations conducted by the Company\u2019s LSM subsidiary.\nThe divestiture of the Company\u2019s Heart Valve business has been substantially completed. The divestiture of LSM remains subject to a number of closing conditions that are beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied or that such divestiture will be completed.\nThe success and continuing development of our products depend on maintaining strong relationships with physicians and healthcare professionals.\nIf we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and other healthcare professionals, our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products. Physicians assist us as researchers, marketing consultants, product consultants, inventors and public speakers, and we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our access to these professionals has been limited at times, and travel restrictions, shutdowns and similar measures have impacted our ability to maintain these relationships, thereby affecting our ability to develop, market and sell new and improved products. If we are unable to maintain these strong relationships, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nInadequate funding for U.S. federal government agencies and government shutdowns could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel, government shutdowns and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. In addition, a portion of our revenue is dependent on U.S. federal government healthcare program\nreimbursement. Any disruption in U.S. federal government operations, including government shutdowns, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may experience volatility in the trading price of our shares due to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, COVID-19 or other factors.\nWe experienced volatility in the trading price of our shares during 2019, 2020 and 2021, including following the pre-release of our earnings for the first quarter in 2019 as well as during COVID-19 in 2020. In the future, our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to many factors, including factors beyond our control, which may cause further volatility in the trading price of our shares. A number of other factors may also cause future volatility in our stock price, including the items discussed in this \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nShareholder activists could cause a disruption to our business.\nIn mid-October 2020, an activist investor indicated its concerns with, among other things, our capital allocation, reporting transparency within our sub-segments, and corporate governance and leadership. In the future, our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected because activist proposals can be a significant distraction for our Board of Directors, management and employees and may require us to expend significant time and resources. Shareholder activists may create uncertainty for our employees, investors and customers, additional risk and uncertainties with respect to our financial position, operations, strategies and management, and may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction also may affect the market price and volatility of our securities.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nPaying amounts due in cash in respect of our outstanding Notes on interest payment dates, at maturity and upon exchange thereof will require a cash payment. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay when due, or raise the funds necessary to pay when due, amounts owed in respect of the Notes or any amounts owed under our revolving credit facility or bridge loan facility, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOn June 17, 2020, our wholly-owned subsidiary, LivaNova USA, Inc., issued $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Cash Exchangeable Senior Notes due in 2025 (the \u201cNotes\u201d). The ability to make scheduled payments of interest on, and principal of, to satisfy exchanges for cash in respect of, and/or to refinance, our outstanding Notes or other indebtedness (including any indebtedness under our revolving credit agreements) depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate enough cash flow to make payments on the Notes or other indebtedness when due, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance the Notes or other indebtedness, which we may need to do in order to satisfy our obligations thereunder, will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on the Notes.\nThe holders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes (the \u201cIndenture\u201d)) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Upon repurchase of the Notes, we will be required to make cash payments as required by the Indenture. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of, or exchange of, the Notes for cash. Our failure to repurchase the Notes or exchange the Notes for cash at a time when the repurchase or exchange is required by the Indenture governing the Notes would constitute a default under such Indenture.\nIn addition, our indebtedness including under the Notes, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments including those under our revolving credit facility or bridge loan facility, could have other important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022Make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in government regulation and in the worldwide economic, industry and competitive environment;\n\u2022Limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u2022Place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt;\n\u2022Limit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund acquisitions, for working capital and for other general corporate purposes; and\n\u2022Make an acquisition of the Company less attractive or more difficult.\nAny of these factors could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness under the revolving credit facility or bridge loan facility, the risks related to our business and our ability to repay our indebtedness including under the Notes would increase. For additional information, please refer to \u201cNote 10. Financing Arrangements\u201d in the consolidated financial statements in this Annual report on Form 10-K.\nThe conditional exchange features of the Notes when triggered, may adversely affect our liquidity and operating results.\nIf the conditional exchange feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of Notes are entitled to exchange the Notes at any time during specified periods, at their option. Holders of the Notes for example, are entitled to exchange the Notes during any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of LivaNova\u2019s ordinary shares, with a nominal value of \u00a31.00 per share for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the exchange price - the exchange price being $60.98 per share and the \u201cconversion trigger\u201d (subject to other conditions per the Indenture) being $79.27 per share - on each applicable trading day. The exchange condition was satisfied on December 20, 2021, which allows the holders of the Notes to request to exchange the Notes through March 31, 2022. If holders elect to exchange their Notes during future periods following the satisfaction of an exchange condition as laid out in the Indenture, we would be required to settle our exchange obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, the Notes are currently redeemable and classified as current, resulting in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nOur debt instruments require us to comply with affirmative covenants and specified financial covenants and ratios and other obligations.\nCertain restrictions and covenants in our debt instruments, including our revolving credit agreement and bridge loan facility, could affect our ability to operate and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, restructure our organization or finance capital needs. Additionally, our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic, financial, regulatory and industry conditions. If any of these restrictions or covenants is breached, we could be in default under one or more of our debt instruments, which, if not cured or waived, could result in acceleration of the indebtedness under such agreements and cross defaults under our other debt instruments. (For more information on these debt instruments, please refer to \u201cNote 10. Financing Arrangements.\u201d)\nThe accounting for the Notes will result in LivaNova having to recognize interest expense significantly greater than the stated interest rates of the Notes and may result in volatility to our reported financial results, which could adversely affect the price at which our ordinary shares trade.\nWe will settle exchanges of the Notes entirely in cash. Accordingly, the exchange feature that is part of the Notes is accounted for as a derivative pursuant to accounting standards relating to derivative instruments. This resulted in an initial valuation of the exchange feature, which was bifurcated from the debt component of the Notes, resulting in an original issue discount. The original issue discount is amortized and recognized as a component of interest expense over the term of the Notes, which results in an effective interest rate reported in our consolidated statements of operations in excess of the stated interest rate of the Notes. Although this accounting treatment does not affect the amount of cash interest paid to holders of the Notes or our cash flows, it reduces our earnings and could adversely affect the price at which our ordinary shares trade.\nAdditionally, for each financial statement period after issuance of the Notes, a derivative gain or loss is and will be reported in our consolidated statements of income (loss) to the extent the valuation of the exchange feature changes from the previous period. The capped call transactions described below and elsewhere in this annual report are also accounted for as derivative instruments. The valuation of the exchange feature of the Notes and capped call transactions utilizes significant observable and unobservable market inputs, including stock price, stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and time to expiration of the Notes. The change of inputs at period end from the previous period may result in a material change of the valuation and the gain or loss resulting from the exchange feature of the Notes and capped call transactions may not completely offset each other. As such, there may be a material net impact to our consolidated statements of operations, which could adversely affect the price at which our ordinary shares trade.\nThe arbitrage or hedging strategy by purchasers of the Notes and Option Counterparties in connection with our capped call transactions may affect the value of our ordinary shares.\nWe expect that many investors in, and potential purchasers of the Notes will employ, or seek to employ, an arbitrage strategy with respect to the Notes. Investors would typically implement such a strategy by selling short our ordinary shares underlying the Notes and dynamically adjusting their short position while continuing to hold the Notes. Investors may also implement this type of strategy by entering into swaps on our ordinary shares in lieu of or in addition to selling short our ordinary shares. This activity could decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our ordinary shares at that time.\nIn connection with the pricing of the Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain financial institutions (the \u201cOption Counterparties\u201d). The capped call transactions are expected generally to offset cash payments due upon exchange of the Notes in excess of the principal amount thereof in the event that the market value per ordinary share of the Company is at the time of exchange of the Notes greater than the strike price under the capped call transactions, with such offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. We understand the Option Counterparties, or their respective affiliates, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, purchased our ordinary shares and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our ordinary shares concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Notes. The Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify these initial hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our ordinary shares and/or purchasing or selling our ordinary shares or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to an exchange of the Notes or upon a repurchase or redemption of the Notes). This activity could cause or avoid an increase or decrease in the market price of our ordinary shares at that time.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\nThe Option Counterparties are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that they might default under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the Option Counterparties is not secured by any collateral.\nIf an Option Counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings, with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the capped call transactions with that Option Counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our ordinary shares. In addition, upon a default by an Option Counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and may, on a net basis, have to pay more cash to settle exchanges of the Notes. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the Option Counterparties.\nRisks Relating to Tax and Our Jurisdiction of Incorporation\nWe are incorporated in England and Wales, and governed by their laws which may afford less protection to shareholders than under U.S. laws.\nBeing that we are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. It may be difficult to enforce any court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in the U.K. based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is also some uncertainty as to whether the courts of U.K. would recognize or enforce judgements of U.S. courts obtained against us or any of our directors or officers.\nChanges in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes in the U.S., the UK, the EU and various other jurisdictions. No assurances can be given as to what our worldwide effective corporate tax rate will be because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the tax regulations and laws, enactment and enforceability thereof and policies of the jurisdictions where we operate. Our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectations or from historical trends and that variance may be material. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We believe that our accruals reflect the probable outcome of known contingencies. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of ongoing audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income (loss) or financial condition.\nThe IRS may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, and we may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes.\nBased on our management and organizational structure, we believe that we should be regarded as a resident exclusively in the UK for tax purposes and that we are appropriately treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. Although we are incorporated in the UK, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal tax purposes. If we were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could be subject to substantially greater U.S. tax liability than currently contemplated as a non-U.S. corporation.\nThe IRS may limit Cyberonics\u2019 and its U.S. affiliates\u2019 ability to utilize their U.S. tax attributes as a result of the merger of Cyberonics and Sorin.\nThe merger of Cyberonics and Sorin is considered an inversion for tax purposes. The U.S. Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) and regulations under the IRC impose a minimum level of tax on any \u201cinversion gain\u201d of a U.S. corporation (and any U.S. person related to the U.S. corporation) depending on the resulting percentage ownership by U.S. persons of the merged company. The effect of this provision in the IRC is to deny the use of certain U.S. tax attributes (including net operating losses and certain tax credits) to offset U.S. tax liability, if any, attributable to such inversion gain. In our case, we believe that the former stockholders of Cyberonics own less than the IRC\u2019s stated percentage of the Company. However, it cannot be assured that the IRS will agree with our position.\nAs an English public limited company, certain capital structure decisions require shareholder approval, which may limit our flexibility to manage our capital structure.\nWe are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Under English law, our board of directors may only allot shares with the prior authorization of shareholders. English law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash, which rights may be excluded by shareholders. In addition, English law generally prohibits a public company from repurchasing its own shares without the prior approval of shareholders. At the 2020 AGM, our shareholders approved the amendment of our articles of association to authorize the allotment of additional shares of up to 20% of our outstanding share capital without preemptive rights for a period of five years, though prior to the 2020 AGM, the Company declared, based on discussions with stakeholders and advisors, that it would not utilize such authorities for more than 18 months in excess of an amount equal to 10% of our then share capital. As a result, at future AGMs, we will be seeking shareholder approval to renew these authorities. If we do not receive shareholder approval of these matters, we may not be able to raise additional capital, in a timely manner or at all, if and as needed to fund our operations. In addition, we may not be able to continue to grant equity awards to employees, directors, officers and consultants under our incentive plans.\nTransfers of our shares, other than ones effected by means of the transfer of book-entry interests in the Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d), may be subject to UK stamp duty or UK stamp duty reserve tax (\u201cSDRT\u201d).\nTransfers of our shares effected by means of the transfer of book-entry interests in DTC are not subject to UK stamp duty or SDRT. However, if a shareholder holds our shares directly rather than through DTC, any transfer of shares could be subject to UK stamp duty or SDRT at a rate of 0.5% of the consideration paid for the transfer and certain issues or transfers of shares to depositories or into clearance services are charged at a rate of 1.5% of the consideration paid for the transfer, or 1.5% of the market value of the shares if there is no consideration. The transferee generally pays the UK stamp duty or SDRT. The potential for UK stamp duty or SDRT could adversely affect the trading price of our shares.\nThe facilities of DTC are a widely used mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in the DTC system, which include many large banks and brokerage firms. Our shares are at present, subject to certain conditions, generally eligible for deposit and clearing within the DTC system. However, DTC generally has discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for our shares. If DTC determines at any time that our shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities, then we believe that our shares would not be eligible for continued listing on a U.S. securities exchange and trading in our shares would be disrupted. While we would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve the listing and maintain trading, any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our shares.", "PERMNO": 78881, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "LIVN"}
