RISK FACTORS\nThe factors described below represent the Corporation's principal risks.\nGlobal Economic Considerations: The Corporation operates in a global, competitive environment, which gives rise to operating and market risk exposure.\nThe Corporation sells substantially all of its products to Dow, which operates in a competitive, global environment, and competes worldwide for sales. Increased levels of competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volume, which could have a negative impact on the Corporation's results of operations. Sales of Dow's products are also subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, trade agreements, import and export controls, and duties and tariffs. The imposition by foreign governments and regional trade agreements could result in lower sales volume which could negatively impact the Corporation's results of operations.\nEconomic conditions around the world and in certain industries in which the Corporation does business also impact sales price and volume. As a result, market uncertainty or an economic downturn in the geographic regions or industries in which UCC sells its products could reduce demand for these products and result in decreased sales volume, which could have a negative impact on UCC's results of operations.\nRaw Materials: Availability of purchased feedstocks and energy, and the volatility of these costs, impact the Corporation's operating costs and add variability to earnings.\nPurchased feedstock and energy costs account for a substantial portion of the Corporation's total production costs and operating expenses. The Corporation purchases hydrocarbon raw materials including ethane, propane, butane and naphtha as feedstocks. The Corporation also purchases certain monomers, primarily ethylene and propylene, to supplement internal production, as well as other raw materials. The Corporation purchases natural gas, primarily to generate electricity, and purchases electric power.\nFeedstock and energy costs generally follow price trends in crude oil and natural gas, which are sometimes volatile. Ultimately, the ability to pass on underlying cost increases is dependent on market conditions. Conversely, when feedstock and energy costs decline, selling prices generally decline as well. As a result, volatility in these costs could impact the Corporation's results of operations.\nWhile the Corporation expects abundant and cost-advantaged supplies of natural gas liquids (\"NGLs\") in the United States to persist for the foreseeable future, if NGLs were to become significantly less advantaged than crude oil-based feedstocks, it could have a negative impact on the Corporation's results of operations and future investments. Also, if the Corporation's key suppliers of feedstocks and energy are unable to provide the raw materials required for production, it could have a negative impact on the Corporation's results of operations.\nSupply/Demand Balance: Earnings generated by the Corporation vary based in part on the balance of supply relative to demand within the industry.\nThe balance of supply relative to demand within the industry may be significantly impacted by the addition of new capacity, especially for basic commodities where capacity is generally added in large increments as world-scale facilities are built. This may disrupt industry balances and result in downward pressure on prices due to the increase in supply, which could negatively impact the Corporation's results of operations.\nFinancial Flexibility: Market conditions could reduce Dow's financial flexibility, which could impact the financial flexibility of the Corporation.\nAdverse economic conditions could reduce Dow's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to fund capital expenditures or working capital needs. The economic environment could result in a contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace and reduce sources of liquidity for Dow and could result in higher borrowing costs. Since Dow is a service provider, material debtor, and the major customer of the Corporation, reduced financial flexibility for Dow could potentially impact the financial flexibility of the Corporation.\nEnvironmental Compliance: The costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements could negatively impact the Corporation's financial results. Actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability.\nThe Corporation is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection of the environment, greenhouse gas emissions and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. At December 31, 2017, the Corporation had accrued obligations of $114 million ($145 million at December 31, 2016) for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, including $19 million ($20 million at December 31, 2016) for the remediation of Superfund sites. This is management's best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the Corporation has accrued liabilities, although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately three times that amount. Costs and capital expenditures relating to environmental, health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements. Moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt the Corporation's operations, or require modifications to its facilities. Accordingly, environmental, health or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities.\nLitigation: The Corporation is party to a number of claims and lawsuits arising out of the normal course of business with respect to commercial matters, including product liability, governmental regulation and other actions.\nThe Corporation is involved in a number of legal proceedings and claims with both private and governmental parties. These cover a wide range of matters, including, but not limited to: product liability; trade regulation; governmental regulatory proceedings; health, safety and environmental matters; employment; patents; contracts; taxes; and commercial disputes. With the exception of the possible effect of the asbestos-related liability described below, it is the opinion of the Corporation's management that the possibility is remote that the aggregate of all such claims and lawsuits will have a material adverse impact on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements.\nThe Corporation is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades. At December 31, 2017, the Corporation's total asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims, including future defense and processing costs, was $1,369 million ($1,490 million at December 31, 2016). See Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on asbestos-related matters.\nHealth and Safety: Increased concerns regarding the safe use of chemicals in commerce and their potential impact on the environment have resulted in more restrictive regulations and could lead to new regulations.\nConcerns regarding the safe use of chemicals in commerce and their potential impact on health and the environment reflect a growing trend in societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection. These concerns could manifest themselves in stockholder proposals, preferred purchasing and continued pressure for more stringent regulatory intervention. These concerns could also influence public perceptions, the viability of the Corporation's products, the Corporation's reputation and the cost to comply with regulations. In addition, terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased concerns about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution. These concerns could have a negative impact on the Corporation's results of operations.\nLocal, state, federal and foreign governments continue to propose new regulations related to the security of chemical plant locations and the transportation of hazardous chemicals, which could result in higher operating costs.\nOperational Event: A significant operational event could negatively impact the Corporation's results of operations.\nAs a diversified chemical manufacturing company, the Corporation's operations, the transportation of products, cyber-attacks or severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena (such as drought, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, etc.) could result in an unplanned event that could be significant in scale and could negatively impact operations, neighbors or the public at large, which could have a negative impact on the Corporation's results of operations.\nMajor hurricanes have caused significant disruption in UCC's operations on the U.S. Gulf Coast, logistics across the region, and the supply of certain raw materials, which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of UCC's products. Due to the Corporation's substantial presence on the U.S. Gulf Coast, similar severe weather conditions or other natural phenomena in the future could negatively affect UCC's results of operations.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits: Increased obligations and expenses related to the Corporation's defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plan could negatively affect UCC's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation has defined benefit pension plans and an other postretirement benefit plan (the \"plans\") in the United States. The assets of the Corporation's funded plans are primarily invested in fixed income securities, equity securities and alternative investments in real estate and private equity of U.S. and foreign issuers. Changes in the market value of plan assets, investment returns, discount rates, mortality rates, the rate of increase in compensation levels, regulations and health care cost trends may affect the funded status of the Corporation's plans and could cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status of the plans. A significant increase in the Corporation's obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on the Corporation's results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the consolidated financial position of the Corporation.\nCyber Threat: The risk of loss of the Corporation's intellectual property, trade secrets or other sensitive business information or disruption of operations could negatively impact the Corporation's financial results.\nCyber-attacks or security breaches could compromise confidential, business critical information, cause a disruption in the Corporation's operations or harm the Corporation's reputation. The Corporation has attractive information assets, including intellectual property, trade secrets and other sensitive, business critical information. While the Corporation has a comprehensive cyber-security program that is continuously reviewed, maintained and upgraded, a significant cyber-attack could result in the loss of critical business information and/or could negatively impact operations, which could have a negative impact on the Corporation's financial results.", "PERMNO": 15659, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "DOW2"}
