RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses and have never been profitable. We expect to incur additional losses in the future and may never be profitable.\nWe have never been profitable or generated positive cash flow from our operations. We have incurred a net loss in each year since our inception in 2016 and have generated limited revenues since inception, principally as a result of our investments in building infrastructure in support of our manufacturing and business operations and plans for growth. We experienced net losses of approximately $10.8 million and $8.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $25.2 million. We may incur significant additional losses as we continue to focus our resources on scaling up our operations for growth and incur significant future expenditures for research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, capital expenses and working capital fluctuations.\nOur ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends mainly upon our ability, alone or with others, to successfully market our products to meet the market demand and maintain compliance with the rules, regulations and laws of federal, state, local and international governmental bodies. We may be unable to achieve any or all of these goals with regard to our products. Our future vehicle roadmap requires significant investment prior to commercial introduction, but these vehicles may never be successfully designed, engineered, manufactured or sold. Moreover, scaling up of our operations, launching additional products and expanding our sales territories will require significant additional investment. We will continue to incur losses until such time that our vehicle sales volume supports our underlying overhead costs. As a result, we may never be profitable or achieve significant and/or sustained revenues. Even if we are successful in generating revenue and increasing our customer base, we may not become profitable in the future or may be unable to maintain any profitability achieved if we fail to increase our revenue and manage our operating expenses or if we incur unanticipated liabilities.\nThe market for our products is developing and may not develop as expected.\nThe market for our electric vehicles is developing and may not develop as expected by us. The market for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new, rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, additional competitors, evolving multi-level government regulations and industry standards, frequent new vehicle announcements and changing consumer demands and behaviors. The electric vehicle market is in its early stage where many standards and best practices have not been established or are constantly evolving, and it may take many years for the market to fully mature.\nWe believe our future success will depend in large part on our ability to quickly and efficiently adapt to both the market demand for products and features, as well as adapt to newly created statutory laws at federal, state, local and international levels. Due to the nature of the electronic vehicle market still in development, it is difficult to predict the demands for our electric vehicles and ancillary services and products, as well as the size and growth rate for this market, the entry of competitive products, or the success of existing competitive products. If a meaningful market for our vehicles does not develop, we will not be successful.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted by public health epidemics, including the recent coronavirus outbreak.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted if a public health epidemic, including the recent coronavirus outbreak, interferes with our ability, or the ability of our employees, workers, contractors, suppliers and other business partners to perform our and their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business. A public health epidemic, including the coronavirus, poses the risk of disruptions from the temporary closure of third-party suppliers and manufacturers, restrictions on our employees\u2019 and other service providers\u2019 ability to travel, the decreased willingness or ability of our customers to test drive or purchase our vehicles and shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely impacted by the recent coronavirus outbreak both in China and the United States. This has delayed our ability to timely procure raw materials from our supplier in China, which, in turn, has delayed shipments to and corresponding revenue from customers. The pandemic and social distancing directives have interfered with our ability, or the ability of our employees, workers, contractors, suppliers and other business partners to perform our and their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business. The COVID-19 pandemic epidemic poses restrictions on our employees\u2019 and other service providers\u2019 ability to travel on pre-sales meetings, customers\u2019 abilities to physically meet with our employees and the ability of our customers to test drive or purchase our vehicles and shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. The extent to which the coronavirus may continue to impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others.\nOur limited operating history makes evaluating our business and prospects difficult and may increase the risk of any investment in our securities.\nOur limited operating history makes evaluating our business and prospects difficult and may increase the risk of your investment. Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future, which makes it difficult to predict our future operating results. Any substantial adjustment to overhead expenses to account for lower levels of sales is difficult and takes time, thus we may not be able to reduce our costs sufficiently to compensate for a shortfall in net sales, and even a small shortfall in net sales could disproportionately and adversely affect our operating margin and operating results for a given period.\nOur operating results may also fluctuate due to a variety of other factors, many of which are outside our control, including the changing and volatile local, national, and international economic environments. Besides the other risks in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, factors that may affect our operations include:\n\u25cf fluctuations in demand for our products;\n\u25cf the inherent complexity, length, and associated unpredictability of product development windows and product lifecycles;\n\u25cf changes in customers\u2019 budgets for technology purchases and delays in their purchasing cycles;\n\u25cf changes in customer preferences;\n\u25cf changing market conditions;\n\u25cf any significant changes in the competitive dynamics of our markets, including new entrants or further consolidation;\n\u25cf our ability to continue to broaden our customer and dealer base beyond our traditional customers and dealers;\n\u25cf our ability to broaden our geographical markets;\n\u25cf the timing of product releases or upgrades by us or our competitors; and\n\u25cf our ability to develop, introduce, and ship in a timely manner new products and product enhancements and anticipate future market demands that meet customers\u2019 requirements.\nEach of these factors individually, or the cumulative effect of two or more of these factors, could result in large fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and our operating results for any given period may fall below expectations or our guidance. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of future performance.\nIf we are unable to effectively implement or manage our growth strategy, our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur ability to generate and grow revenue will depend, in part, on our ability to execute our business plan, expand our business model and develop new products in a timely manner. As part of our growth strategy, we may modify our distribution channels and engage in strategic transactions with third parties to access additional sales and distribution channels and accelerate product adoption for particular vertical markets, open new manufacturing, research or engineering facilities or expand our existing facilities. We also plan to add additional product lines and expand our businesses into new geographical markets. There is a range of risks inherent in such a strategy that could adversely affect our ability to successfully achieve these objectives, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf the potential failure to successfully operate our dealer-distribution channels;\n\u25cf an inability to attract and retain customers, employees, suppliers and/or marketing partners;\n\u25cf the uncertainty that we may not be able to generate, anticipate or meet consumer demand;\n\u25cf the potential disruption of our business;\n\u25cf the increased scope and complexity of our operations could require significant attention from management and impose constraints on our operations or other projects;\n\u25cf inconsistencies between our standards, procedures and policies and those of new points of sale or dealerships and costs or inefficiencies associated with the integration of our operational and administrative systems, if necessary;\n\u25cf unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions, including the potential for increased regulatory compliance or other third-party approvals or consents, or provisions in contracts with third parties that could limit our flexibility to take certain actions;\n\u25cf the costs of compliance with local laws and regulations and the implementation of compliance processes, as well as the assumption of unexpected labilities, litigation, penalties or other enforcement actions;\n\u25cf the uncertainty that new product lines or ancillary services will generate anticipated sales;\n\u25cf the uncertainty that the expanded operations will achieve anticipated operating results;\n\u25cf the difficulty of managing the operations of a larger company;\n\u25cf the difficulty of competing for growth opportunities with companies that have greater financial resources than us; and\n\u25cf the ability of our suppliers to support consumer demand.\nAny one of these factors could impair our growth strategy, result in delays, increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues derived from our growth strategy and could adversely impact our prospects, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenues are derived from a single customer. If we were to lose this customer, our sales could decrease significantly.\nIn March 2019, we entered the MPA with Club Car, which grants Club Car the exclusive right to sell the AYRO 411 Fleet in North America, provided that Club Car orders at least 500 AYRO vehicles per year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues from Club Car constituted approximately 68% of our revenues as compared to 75% in 2019. For the year 2021, a majority of our revenue is projected to be generated from Club Car pursuant to the MPA. We are therefore highly dependent on a single customer to generate a material percentage of our annual revenues, and the lack of adoption, failure to achieve reasonable \u201csell through\u201d rates by the customer\u2019s dealers, unfavorable dealer/customer experience or discontinuation or modification of terms may materially and adversely affect our sales and results of operations. Any loss of, or a significant reduction in purchases by, Club Car that constitutes a significant portion of our sales could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nOur future growth depends on customers\u2019 willingness to adopt electric vehicles.\nIf there is lower market demand for our electric vehicles than we expect in the target markets, which include universities, food delivery services, last mile delivery service, municipalities and on-road and personal transportation, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be negatively impacted. Potential customers may be reluctant to adopt electric vehicles as an alternative to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles or other electric vehicles due to various factors, which include but are not limited to:\n\u25cf perceptions or negative publicity about electric vehicle quality, dependability, safety, stability of lithium-ion battery packs, utility, performance and cost regarding our vehicles or electric vehicles sold by other manufacturers, especially if accidents or certain events create a negative public perception;\n\u25cf local, regional, national and international investment in charging infrastructure, standardization of electric vehicle charging systems and cost of charging that may impact adaptability for the overall electric vehicle market;\n\u25cf the limited range of the vehicle on a single battery charge cycle;\n\u25cf the impact of driving habits and terrain on the battery life, especially the differences with internal combustion engines;\n\u25cf the deterioration rate of the battery packs that are impacted by many external factors, including, but not limited to, overall life, environmental conditions, dormant time, and number of lifetime charge cycles and these factors\u2019 impacts on the batteries\u2019 ability to maintain an adequate charge;\n\u25cf the access to knowledgeable service locations to support our electric vehicles;\n\u25cf the price of alternative fuel sources, such as gasoline as an alternative to the cost of charging electricity; and\n\u25cf the availability of governmental incentive and tax deductions and credits offered to consumers for purchasing and using electric vehicles.\nAny of the above factors may hinder widespread adoption of electric vehicles and influence prospective customers and dealers to decide not to purchase our electric vehicles. Such issues would have an adverse material effect on our consolidated financial statements of operations, financial conditions, ability to develop strategic partnerships and ability to raise additional funding. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact the transportation and automotive industries and consumer behavior long-term.\nWe may experience lower-than-anticipated market acceptance of our current models and the vehicles in development.\nOur projected growth depends upon the end-consumers\u2019 mass adoption of our purpose-built electric vehicles. Although we have conducted some market research regarding our electric vehicles we currently sell or are developing, many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of our vehicles in the marketplace. At this time, it is difficult to measure consumers\u2019 willingness to adopt purpose-built electric vehicles, particularly two-passenger electric vehicles. Offering fuel-efficient vehicles that consumers want and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand, but vehicles that are perceived to be less desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, styling, safety, overall value, or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks. For example, if a new vehicle encountered quality issues at the time of launch, the vehicle\u2019s perceived quality could be affected even after the issues had been corrected, resulting in lower than anticipated sales volumes, market share, and profitability. Moreover, if a new vehicle is not accepted by consumers based on size, styling, or other attributes, we would experience lower than anticipated sales volumes, market share, and profitability. If our vehicles are not adopted or there is a reduction in demand for our products caused by a lack of customer acceptance, a slowdown in demand for electronic transportation solutions, battery safety concerns, technological challenges, battery life issues, competing technologies and products, decreases in discretionary spending, weakening economic conditions, or otherwise, the reduction in demand could result in reduced customer orders, early order cancellations, the loss of customers, or decreased sales, any of which would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth and expand our operations successfully, our business and operating results will be harmed, and our reputation may be damaged.\nWe have been expanding our operations significantly since our inception and anticipate that further significant expansion will be required to achieve our business objectives. The growth and expansion of our business and product offerings places a continuous and significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources. Any such future growth would also add complexity to and require effective coordination throughout our organization. Our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage this expansion and growth successfully. Risks that we face in undertaking this expansion include:\n\u25cf establishing sufficient sales, service and service facilities in a timely manner;\n\u25cf forecasting production and revenue;\n\u25cf training new personnel;\n\u25cf controlling expenses and investments in anticipation of expanded operations;\n\u25cf establishing or expanding design, manufacturing, sales and service facilities;\n\u25cf implementing and enhancing administrative infrastructure, systems and processes;\n\u25cf addressing new markets;\n\u25cf expanding operations and finding and hiring a significant number of additional personnel, including manufacturing personnel, design personnel, engineers and service technicians; and\n\u25cf securing sub-assemblies and other raw materials from our suppliers to support growth.\nIn this regard, we will be required to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting procedures, and we may not be able to successfully implement improvements to these systems and processes in a timely or efficient manner, which could result in additional operating inefficiencies and could cause our costs to increase more than planned. If we do increase our operating expenses in anticipation of the growth of our business and this growth does not meet our expectations, our operating results and gross margin will be negatively impacted. If we are unable to manage future expansion, our ability to provide high quality products could be harmed, damage our reputation and brand and may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDevelopments in alternative technologies or improvements in the internal combustion engine may have a materially adverse effect on the demand for our electric vehicles.\nSignificant developments related to ethanol or compressed natural gas, or improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine or hybrids, may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we do not currently anticipate. For example, types of fuel that are abundant and relatively inexpensive in North America, such as compressed natural gas, may emerge as consumers\u2019 preferred alternative to petroleum-based propulsion. If alternative energy engines or low gasoline prices make existing four-wheeled vehicles with greater passenger and cargo capacities less expensive to operate, we may not be able to compete with manufacturers of such vehicles. Furthermore, given the rapidly changing nature of the electric vehicle market, there can be no assurance that our vehicles and technology will not be rendered obsolete by alternative or competing technologies. Any material change in the existing technologies may cause delays in our development and introduction of new or upgraded vehicles, which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our vehicles, decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in these industries. We currently face competition from new and established domestic and international competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future, including competition from companies with new technology.\nWe face significant competition, and there is no assurance that our vehicles will be successful in the respective markets in which they compete. The worldwide vehicle market, particularly for alternative fuel vehicles, is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. Established automobile manufacturers such as General Motors, Ford, Nissan and Toyota, as well as other newer companies such as Tesla, Arcimoto and Electrameccanica, have entered or are reported to have plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles. In some cases, such competitors have announced an intention to now or at some point in the future produce electric vehicles exclusively. As the LSEV market grows increasingly saturated, we expect to experience significant competition. The most competitive companies in the global LSEV market include HDK Electric Vehicles, Bradshaw Electric Vehicles, Textron Inc., Polaris Industries, Yamaha Motors Co. Ltd., Ingersoll Rand, Inc., Speedway Electric, AGT Electric Cars, Bintelli Electric Vehicles and Ligier Group. Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than us, and significantly greater experience in manufacturing, designing and selling electric vehicles, as well as in clearing regulatory requirements of those vehicles in the United States and in foreign countries. Many of our current and potential future competitors also have significantly more experience designing, building and selling electric vehicles at commercial, or fleet, scale. Large automobile or equipment manufacturers with greater purchasing power allow them to acquire raw materials at a much lower cost. Additionally, the large traditional manufacturer has more ready access to efficient design, testing and service facilities. We do not have the company history, facilities or capital to properly compete with large traditional manufacturers should they decide to enter our market. Mergers and acquisitions in the electric vehicle market could result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Increased competition could result in lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Additionally, industry overcapacity has resulted in many manufacturers offering marketing incentives on vehicles in an attempt to maintain and grow market share; these incentives historically have included a combination of subsidized financing or leasing programs, price rebates, and other incentives. As a result, we are not necessarily able to set our prices to offset higher costs. Continuation of or increased excess capacity could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nNew entrants seeking to gain market share by introducing new technology, attractive feature sets, new products and development of longer-life power packs may make it more difficult for us to sell our vehicles and earn design wins which could create increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses, or the loss of market share or expected market share, any of which may significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur future success depends on our ability to identify additional market opportunities and develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products that address such markets and meet the needs of customers in such markets.\nWe may not be able to successfully develop new electric vehicles, address new market segments or develop a broader customer base. We currently sell one four-wheeled truck, from which all of our revenues are derived. We are currently developing our next generation three-wheeled vehicle. Our future success will be dependent on our ability to address additional markets, anticipate our existing and prospective customers\u2019 needs and develop new vehicle models that meet those needs. In particular, we are currently developing a new series of automotive-grade autocycles, engineered and optimized to meet targeted use cases such as last mile and urban delivery and are also working on Club Car\u2019s next generation, electric light duty trucks and developing a new purpose-built vehicle with Club Car. We will have to incorporate the latest technological improvements and enhancements into our future vehicles to be able to compete in the rapidly evolving electric vehicle industry and the target markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to design future models of vehicles, or develop future services, that will meet the expectations of our customers or address market demands, or that our future models will achieve market acceptance or become commercially viable.\nIn order to introduce new products and product enhancements, we will have to coordinate with our suppliers and other third parties to design a new model or an enhanced version of an existing model that offer features desired by our customers and a level of performance and functionality or cost-effectiveness superior to the vehicles offered by our competitors. If we fail to coordinate these efforts and achieve market introduction and acceptance of new or upgraded vehicles models that address the needs of our customers in a timely manner, our operating results will be materially and adversely affected, and our business and prospects will be harmed.\nFurthermore, we will need to address additional markets and expand our customer demographic to further grow our business. Our failure to address additional market opportunities could materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nIf we fail to include key feature sets relative to the target markets for our electric vehicles, our business will be harmed.\nAchieving design wins to support the needs of our target markets is an important success factor for our business. In order to achieve design wins, we must:\n\u25cf anticipate the features and functionality that OEMs, customers and consumers will demand;\n\u25cf successfully incorporate those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting design requirements of our customers; and\n\u25cf price our products competitively.\nFailure to maintain our expertise and inability to deliver custom, specific design systems could harm our business.\nUnanticipated changes in industry standards could render our vehicles incompatible with such standards and adversely affect our business.\nThe emergence of new industry standards and technical requirements could render our vehicles incompatible with vehicles developed by competitors or make it difficult for our products to meet the requirements of our end-customers. Moreover, the introduction of new industry standards, or changes to existing industry standards, could cause us to incur substantial development costs to adapt to these new or changed standards, particularly if we were to achieve, or be perceived as likely to achieve, greater penetration in the marketplace. If our vehicles are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards and technical requirements for a significant period of time, we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins, our revenue may decline and we may incur significant expenses to redesign our vehicles to meet the relevant standards, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.\nWe rely on and intend to continue to rely on a single third-party supplier and manufacturer located in the People\u2019s Republic of China for the sub-assemblies in semi-knocked-down for all of our vehicles. Any disruption in the operations of this third-party supplier could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs part of our strategy to minimize our capital expenditures on manufacturing infrastructure, we currently rely on Cenntro for the sub-assemblies for the AYRO 411 Fleet vehicles. Cenntro also owns the design of the AYRO 411 Fleet and has granted us an exclusive license to purchase the AYRO 411 Fleet for sale in North America. Our dependence on a single supplier and manufacturer, and the challenges we may face in obtaining adequate supplies and vehicle kits required to assemble our vehicles, involve several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality and delivery schedules.\nWe cannot be certain that Cenntro will continue to provide us with the quantities of the sub-assembles that we require or satisfy our anticipated specifications and quality requirements. If Cenntro experiences unanticipated delays, disruptions or shutdowns or is unable to ship required raw materials, sub-assemblies, replacement or warranty parts for any reason, within or outside of Cenntro\u2019s control, our manufacturing operations and customer deliveries would be seriously impacted. Although we believe we could locate alternative suppliers to fulfill our needs, we may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time or on commercially reasonable terms or develop our own replacements, especially when we rely on the license granted by Cenntro, who owns the design of the AYRO 411 Fleet. In December 2019, a strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, resulting in government-imposed quarantines and other public health safety measures. The extent to which the coronavirus may impact our operations continues to be uncertain; however, the outbreak and continuous spreading of the coronavirus has caused, and could in the future cause, delays or disruptions in our supply chain and in the delivery of raw materials from Cenntro or our other suppliers located in China, which would be disruptive to the manufacturing of the vehicles and would adversely impact our business. In addition, the spreading of the virus may make it more difficult for us in finding alternative manufactures or suppliers due to the high concentration of such manufacturers or suppliers located in China. Any performance failure on the part of Cenntro or any other of our significant suppliers could interrupt production of our vehicles, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAdditionally, because Cenntro\u2019s factories are located in the People\u2019s Republic of China, nation-to-nation quarantining and embargo restrictions and/or regulations could be established by either the United States or Chinese governments, precluding us from sourcing the raw materials needed in a timely manner. This would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nUnforeseen or recurring operational problems at ours or our prime supplier\u2019s facilities, or a catastrophic loss of ours or our prime supplier\u2019s manufacturing facilities, may cause significant lost or delayed production and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe import sub-assemblies from Cenntro and perform final assembly, testing and safety qualifications in our facility in Round Rock, Texas in an assembly line process. Our manufacturing process could be affected by operational problems that could impair our production capability and the timeframes within which we expect to produce our vehicles. Disruptions or shutdowns at our assembly facility could be caused by:\n\u25cf maintenance outages to conduct maintenance activities that cannot be performed safely during operations;\n\u25cf pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and related governmental responses that may restrict our ability to operate;\n\u25cf prolonged power failures or reductions;\n\u25cf breakdown, failure or substandard performance of any of our machines or other equipment;\n\u25cf noncompliance with, and liabilities related to, environmental requirements or permits;\n\u25cf disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including railroad tracks, bridges, tunnels or roads;\n\u25cf fires, floods, snow or ice storms, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, microbursts or other catastrophic disasters, national emergencies, political unrest, war or terrorist activities; or\n\u25cf other operational problems.\n\u25cf availability of parts, including both batteries and semiconductors, which are used to produce many components of our vehicles.\nIf our manufacturing facility or that of our prime supplier is compromised or shut down, we may experience prolonged startup periods, regardless of the reason for the compromise or shutdown. Those startup periods could range from several days to several weeks or longer, depending on the reason for the compromise or shutdown and other factors. Any disruption in operations at our facility could cause a significant loss of production, delays in our ability to produce our vehicles and adversely affect our results of operations and negatively impact our customers. Further, a catastrophic event could result in the loss of the use of all or a portion of our manufacturing facility. Although we carry property insurance, our coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur. Any of these events individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims.\nWe may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. The automobile industry experiences significant product liability claims, and we face an inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform as expected or malfunction resulting in personal injury or death. Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given that our vehicles have a limited commercial history. A successful product liability claim against us that exceeds our product liability insurance limits could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our vehicles and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future vehicles, which would have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, prospects and operating results. We maintain product liability insurance for all of our vehicles with annual limits of $10.0 million on a claims-made basis, but any such insurance might not be sufficient to cover all potential product liability claims. Any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages either in excess of our coverage, or outside of our coverage, may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial condition. We may not be able to secure additional product liability insurance coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed, particularly if we do face liability for our vehicles and are forced to make a claim under our policy.\nIf our vehicles fail to perform as expected due to defects, our ability to develop, market and sell our electric vehicles could be seriously harmed.\nOur vehicles may contain defects in design and manufacturing that may cause them not to perform as expected or that may require repair. The discovery of defects in our vehicles would result in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, reputational damage, or increased warranty costs that may negatively affect our business. Moreover, if one of our vehicles is a cause, or perceived to be the cause, of injury or death to an operator, passenger or bystander, we would likely be subject to a claim. If we were found responsible, we could incur substantial liability which could interrupt or even cause us to terminate some or all of our operations.\nMeeting or exceeding many government-mandated safety standards is costly and often technologically challenging. Government safety standards also require manufacturers to remedy defects related to vehicle safety through safety recall campaigns, and a manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. The costs of recall campaigns or warranty costs to remedy such defects in vehicles that have been sold could be substantial. Further, adverse publicity surrounding actual or alleged safety-related or other defects could damage our reputation and confidence in our vehicles, which would adversely affect sales of our vehicles.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and the loss of one or more members of our management team, or our failure to attract, integrate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business.\nWe believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, technical, finance and sales and marketing personnel. We have only one line of business and are highly dependent upon the continued service of our key executive officers and other employees. The loss of and failure to replace key management and personnel could have a serious adverse effect on sales bookings, strategic relationships, manufacturing operations, order fulfilment and customer service, and may adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management may terminate their employment with us at any time. Although we have written employment agreements with our executive officers, these employment agreements do not bind these executives for any specific term and allow executive officers to leave at any time, for any reason, with or without cause. We do not maintain any \u201ckey-man\u201d insurance policies on any of the key employees nor do we intend to obtain such insurance.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified employees, consultants, and advisors for our business, including sales or technical personnel, is crucial to continue to execute our growth strategy. Because the pool of qualified personnel with engineering or manufacturing experience and/or experience working in the electric vehicle market is limited overall, recruitment and retention of senior management and skilled technical, sales and other personnel is very competitive. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than us. We are also at a disadvantage in recruiting and retaining key personnel, as our small size and limited resources may be viewed as providing a less stable environment with fewer opportunities than would be offered at one of our larger competitors. As a result, we may not be successful in either attracting or retaining such personnel and/or on acceptable terms given the competition and may be required to increase the level of compensation paid to existing and new employees, which could materially increase our operating expenses. In addition, failure to succeed in expansion of our operations may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel.\nOur management has minimal experience in mass-producing electric vehicles.\nOur management has never mass-produced electric vehicles, which generally involves manufacturing process challenges, such as manufacturing to meet the volumes forecasted and efficiently and effectively managing supply chain sources for materials. If the materials suppliers are not managed properly to support vehicle demand, our results of operations and working capital can be adversely affected. If we are unable to implement our business plans in the timeframe estimated by management and successfully transition into a mass-producing electric vehicle manufacturing business, we will not be able to scale up our operations to generate greater profit. As a result, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition will be negatively impacted and our ability to grow our business will be harmed.\nFurthermore, as the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport to our manufacturing facilities components at much higher volumes than we have done in the past. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual production plans or capabilities, or successfully implement automation, inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain, we may have to incur unexpected storage, transportation and write-off costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe currently have limited electric vehicles marketing and sales experience. If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into dealer agreements to market and sell our vehicles, we may be unable to generate any revenue.\nWe have limited experience selling and marketing our vehicles, and we currently have minimal marketing or sales organization. To successfully expand our operations, we will need to invest in and develop these capabilities, either on our own or with others, which would be expensive, difficult and time consuming. Any failure or delay in the timely development of our internal sales and marketing capabilities could adversely impact the potential for success of our products.\nFurther, given our lack of prior experience in marketing and selling electric vehicles, we rely on third-party dealers to market our vehicles. If these dealers do not commit sufficient resources to market our vehicles and we are unable to develop the necessary marketing and sales capabilities on our own, including developing a direct sales channel with our end-customers, we will be unable to generate sufficient revenue from the sale of our vehicles to sustain or grow our business. We may be competing with companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations, particularly in the markets we are targeting. Without appropriate capabilities, whether directly or through third-party dealerships, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nFailure to maintain the strength and value of our brand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, on the value and strength of our brand. Maintaining, enhancing, promoting and positioning our brand, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition, will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high-quality services, warranty plans, products and resources and a consistent, high-quality customer experience. Our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives, if we fail to comply with laws and regulations, if we are subject to publicized litigation or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Some of these risks may be beyond our ability to control, such as the effects of negative publicity regarding our suppliers or third-party providers of services or other electric transportation companies or their products or negative publicity related to members of management. Any of these events could hurt our image, resulting in reduced demand for our products and a decrease in sales. Further, maintaining, enhancing, promoting and positioning our brands\u2019 images may require us to make substantial investments in marketing and employee training, which could adversely affect our cash flow, and which may ultimately be unsuccessful. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines over time which may negatively influence potential customers\u2019 decisions on whether to purchase our vehicles.\nThe range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage, time and charging patterns. For example, a customer\u2019s use of their vehicle, as well as the frequency with which they charge the battery of their vehicle, can result in additional deterioration of the battery\u2019s ability to hold a charge. Additionally, over time, a battery\u2019s ability to hold its initial charge will degrade. While expected in electric vehicle applications, such battery deterioration and the related decrease in range may negatively influence potential customer decisions as to whether to purchase our vehicles, which may harm our ability to market and sell our vehicles.\nWe offer a product warranty to cover defective products at no cost to the customer. An unexpected change in failure rates of our products could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe offer product warranties that generally extend for two years from date of sale that require us to repair or replace defective products returned by the customer during the warranty period at no cost to the customer. While defects in the individual parts for our vehicles are currently reimbursed by our supply chain, warranty labor is our responsibility. We record an estimate for anticipated warranty-related costs at the time of sale based on historical and estimated future product return rates and expected repair or replacement costs. While such costs and failure rates have historically been within management\u2019s expectations and the provisions established and we receive warranty coverage from our vendors, unexpected changes in failure rates could have a material adverse impact on our business requiring additional warranty reserves. These failures could adversely impact our operating results.\nIncreases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials, particularly lithium-ion cells, could harm our business.\nWe may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of raw materials. Any such increase or supply interruption could materially negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We use various raw materials in our business, including aluminum, steel, carbon fiber, non-ferrous metals such as copper and cobalt. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials and could adversely affect our business and operating results. For instance, we are exposed to multiple risks relating to price fluctuations for lithium-ion cells. These risks include:\n\u25cf the inability or unwillingness of current battery manufacturers to build or operate battery cell manufacturing plants to supply the numbers of lithium-ion cells required to support the growth of the electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle industry as demand for such cells increases;\n\u25cf disruption in the supply of cells due to quality issues or recalls by the battery cell manufacturers; and\n\u25cf an increase in the cost of raw materials, such as cobalt, used in lithium-ion cells.\nOur business depends on the continued supply of battery cells for our vehicles. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our suppliers or industry shortage or price escalations could temporarily disrupt the planned production of our vehicles until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified. Moreover, battery cell manufacturers may choose to refuse to supply electric vehicle manufacturers to the extent they determine that the vehicles are not sufficiently safe. Furthermore, current fluctuations or shortages in petroleum, shipping seasonality and government-imposed tariffs and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and raw material costs. Substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased electric vehicle prices. We might not be able to recoup increasing costs of raw materials by increasing vehicle prices which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects and operating results.\nOur business may be adversely affected by labor and union activities.\nAlthough none of our employees are currently represented by a labor union, it is common throughout the automobile industry generally for many employees at automobile companies to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. We rely on other companies in the supply chain with work forces that may or may not be unionized and are thus subject to work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results. If a work stoppage occurs within our business, or within that of our key suppliers\u2019 businesses, it could delay the manufacturing, sale and shipment of our electric vehicles and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition.\nWe rely on our dealers for the service of our vehicles and have limited experience servicing our vehicles. If we are unable to address the service requirements of our future customers, our business will be materially and adversely affected.\nCurrently, our vehicles are serviced by the selling dealer. If the dealer is unable to successfully address the service requirements of our customers, customer confidence in both the vehicles and our brand will erode and our prospects and operating results will be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we anticipate the level and quality of service the dealers will provide to our customers will have a direct impact on the success of our future vehicles. If our dealers are unable to satisfactorily service our customers, our ability to generate customer loyalty, grow our business and sell additional vehicles could be significantly impaired.\nOur dealers have very limited experience servicing our vehicles. Servicing electric vehicles is different than servicing vehicles with internal combustion engines and requires specialized skills, including high voltage training and servicing techniques.\nIf we fail to deliver vehicles and accessories to market as scheduled, our business will be harmed.\nA significant amount of our revenue is seasonal. By missing product delivery schedules, we may miss that year\u2019s opportunity to bring and sell a new product to market. Seasonality could be affected by many factors including, but not limited to, governmental fiscal years, as municipalities tend to order vehicles either at the end of their fiscal year when they know they have funds remaining, and summer tourist season for our destination fleet operators, as such customers tend to place their entire orders for delivery in time for the beginning of the tourist season.\nOur success depends, in part, on establishing and maintaining good relationships with our network of dealers.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we derived 68% and 75% of our vehicle revenue from Club Car under our MPA, for distribution through Club Car dealers. Our success depends, in part, on us establishing and maintaining satisfactory relationships with both the Club Car corporate organization as well as its distribution channels or its dealers. If we were unable to establish and maintain an adequate relationship with Club Car and its dealer network or, once established, if our relationship with Club Car or its dealer network were to be eliminated abruptly or disrupted, it could affect our ability to respond quickly to customers\u2019 needs, resulting in various adverse consequences to us, including loss of sales, reduced cash flow, and/or a shutdown of our operations. In addition, as authorized dealers of our vehicles, the dealers could, through poor performance on such dealer\u2019s part, damage our and our vehicles\u2019 reputation in the marketplace, resulting in a loss of sales and cash flow which could adversely affect our business operations.\nCustomer financing and insuring our vehicles may prove difficult because retail lenders are unfamiliar with our vehicles and our vehicles have a limited loss history determining residual values and within the insurance industry.\nRetail lenders are unfamiliar with our vehicles and may be hesitant to provide financing to our customers. Our vehicles do not have a loss history in the insurance industry, which may cause our customers difficulty in securing insurance coverage.\nFailure in our information technology and storage systems could significantly disrupt the operation of our business.\nOur ability to execute our business plan and maintain operations depends on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems. We must routinely update our IT infrastructure and our various IT systems throughout the organization, or we may not continue to meet our current and future business needs. Modification, upgrade or replacement of such systems may be costly. Furthermore, IT systems are vulnerable to risks and damages from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of our and our vendors\u2019 servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Despite precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our IT systems, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe may be required to raise additional capital to fund our operations, and such capital raising may be costly or difficult to obtain and could dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership interests.\nThe design, manufacture, sale and servicing of vehicles is a capital-intensive business, and we may need to raise additional funds to expand our operations and reach vehicle production goals. At December 31, 2020, we had working capital of approximately $38.5 million, and we received subsequent to December 31, 2020 aggregate net proceeds of approximately $56.8 million registered direct offerings that closed in January 2021 and February 2021. Based upon our current expectations, we believe that our existing capital resources, including the proceeds from our registered direct offerings that closed in January 2021 and February 2021, will enable us to continue planned operations through at least March 31, 2022. However, we cannot assure you that our plans will not change or that changed circumstances will not result in the depletion of our capital resources more rapidly than we currently anticipate. If our cash on hand, the funds from the January 2021 and February 2021 registered direct offerings and our sales revenue are not sufficient to cover our cash requirements, we will need to raise additional capital, whether through the sale of equity or debt securities, the entry into strategic business collaborations, the establishment of other funding facilities, licensing arrangements, or asset sales or other means, in order to support our business plan. In addition, we may need to raise additional capital for strategic acquisitions or transactions. Such additional capital we may need may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nOur ability to obtain the necessary financing to carry out our business plan is subject to a number of factors, including general market conditions, performance of our vehicles, market demand for our vehicles and investor acceptance of our business plan. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of such financing unattractive or unavailable to us. If we are unable to obtain additional financing on a timely basis, we may have to curtail, delay or eliminate our development activities and growth plans, and/or be forced to sell some or all assets, perhaps on unfavorable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately we could be forced to discontinue our operations and liquidate, in which event it is unlikely that stockholders would receive any distribution on their shares. Further, we may not be able to continue operating if we do not generate sufficient revenues from operations needed to stay in business.\nWe have raised capital in the past primarily through public offerings, as well as debt and private placements of our convertible preferred stock. We may in the future pursue the sale of additional equity and/or debt securities, or the establishment of other funding facilities including asset-based borrowings. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to raise additional capital through such an offering on acceptable terms, or at all. Issuances of additional debt or equity securities could impact the rights of the holders of our common stock and may dilute their ownership percentage. The terms of any securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect on the holders of any of our securities then outstanding.\nThe terms of debt securities we may have to issue or future borrowings we may have to incur to fund our operations could impose significant restrictions on our operations. The incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance of certain equity securities could result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights, and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our products, to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, or to issue equity instruments that may be dilutive to our stockholders.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial condition.\nOur long-term capital requirements are subject to numerous risks.\nOur long-term capital requirements are expected to depend on many potential factors, including, among others:\n\u25cf the number of vehicles being manufactured and future models in development;\n\u25cf the regulatory compliance and clarity of each of our vehicles;\n\u25cf the progress, success and cost of our development programs, including manufacturing;\n\u25cf the costs of manufacturing, developing sales, marketing and distribution channels;\n\u25cf the costs of enforcing our issued patents and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u25cf our ability to successfully grow sales, including securing strategic partner and distribution agreements and favorable pricing and market share; and\n\u25cf our consumption of available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated, resulting in the need for additional funding sooner than anticipated.\nWe may invest in or acquire other businesses, and our business may suffer if we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our company or otherwise manage the growth associated with multiple acquisitions.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may make acquisitions as opportunities arise to add new or complementary businesses, products, brands or technologies. In some cases, the costs of such acquisitions may be substantial, including as a result of professional fees and due diligence efforts. There is no assurance that the time and resources expended on pursuing a particular acquisition will result in a completed transaction, or that any completed transaction will ultimately be successful. In addition, we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition or strategic investment opportunities or may be unable to obtain any required financing or regulatory approvals, and therefore may be unable to complete such acquisitions or strategic investments on favorable terms, if at all. We may decide to pursue acquisitions with which our investors may not agree and we cannot assure investors that any acquisition or investment will be successful or otherwise provide a favorable return on investment. In addition, acquisitions and the integration thereof require significant time and resources and place significant demands on our management, as well as on our operational and financial infrastructure. In addition, if we fail to successfully close transactions or integrate new teams, or integrate the products and technologies associated with these acquisitions into our company, our business could be seriously harmed. Acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks, including:\n\u25cf the ability to profitably manage acquired businesses or successfully integrate the acquired businesses\u2019 operations, personnel, financial reporting, accounting and internal controls, technologies and products into our business;\n\u25cf increased indebtedness and the expense of integrating acquired businesses, including significant administrative, operational, economic, geographic or cultural challenges in managing and integrating the expanded or combined operations;\n\u25cf entry into jurisdictions or acquisition of products or technologies with which we have limited or no prior experience, and the potential of increased competition with new or existing competitors as a result of such acquisitions;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention and the over-extension of our operating infrastructure and our management systems, information technology systems, and internal controls and procedures, which may be inadequate to support growth;\n\u25cf the ability to fund our capital needs and any cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenue is not realized or is delayed, whether by general economic or market conditions, or unforeseen internal difficulties; and\n\u25cf the ability to retain or hire qualified personnel required for expanded operations.\nOur acquisition strategy may not succeed if we are unable to remain attractive to target companies or expeditiously close transactions. Issuing shares of our common stock to fund an acquisition would cause economic dilution to existing stockholders. If we develop a reputation for being a difficult acquirer or having an unfavorable work environment, or target companies view our common stock unfavorably, we may be unable to consummate key acquisition transactions essential to our corporate strategy and our business may be seriously harmed.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nIncreased safety, emissions, fuel economy, or other regulations may result in higher costs, cash expenditures, and/or sales restrictions.\nThe motorized vehicle industry is governed by a substantial amount of government regulation, which often differs by state and region. Government regulation has arisen, and proposals for additional regulation are advanced, primarily out of concern for the environment, vehicle safety, and energy independence. In addition, many governments regulate local product content and/or impose import requirements as a means of creating jobs, protecting domestic producers, and influencing the balance of payments. The cost to comply with existing government regulations is substantial, and future, additional regulations could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition.\nOur vehicles are subject to multi-jurisdictional motor vehicle standards.\nAll vehicles sold must comply with federal, state and country-specific motor vehicle safety standards. Rigorous testing and the use of approved materials and equipment are among the requirements for achieving federal certification. Failure of the AYRO 411 Fleet or future vehicle models to satisfy motor vehicle standards would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nChanges in regulations could render our vehicles incompatible with federal, state or local regulations, or use cases.\nMany governmental standards and regulations relating to safety, fuel economy, emissions control, noise control, vehicle recycling, substances of concern, vehicle damage, and theft prevention are applicable to new motor vehicles, engines, and equipment manufactured for sale in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including our electric vehicles. In addition, manufacturing and other automotive assembly facilities in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere are subject to stringent standards regulating air emissions, water discharges, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances. Therefore, any unanticipated changes in regulations applicable to our electric vehicles could render our vehicles incompatible, which may prevent us from selling such vehicles and, as a result, we could lose market share.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws, including statutes, regulations, bylaws and other legal requirements. These laws relate to the generation, use, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of regulated substances, including hazardous substances (such as batteries), dangerous goods and waste, emissions or discharges into soil, water and air, including noise and odors (which could result in remediation obligations), and occupational health and safety matters, including indoor air quality. These legal requirements vary by location and can arise under federal, provincial, state or municipal laws. Any breach of such laws and/or requirements would have a material adverse effect on our company and our operating results.\nUnusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in our vehicles, or otherwise, may derail our business.\nAlthough we plan to comply with governmental safety regulations, mobile and stationary source emissions regulations, and other standards, compliance with governmental standards does not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits, which can entail significant cost and risk. In certain circumstances, courts may permit tort claims even when our vehicles comply with federal law and/or other applicable law. Furthermore, simply responding to actual or threatened litigation or government investigations of our compliance with regulatory standards, whether related to our vehicles, business or commercial relationships, may require significant expenditures of time and other resources. Litigation also is inherently uncertain, and we could experience significant adverse results if litigation is ever brought against us. In addition, adverse publicity surrounding an allegation of a defect, regulatory violation or other matter (with or without corresponding litigation or governmental investigation) may cause significant reputational harm that could have a significant adverse effect on our sales.\nIn order for us to sell directly to end customers, we are required to comply with state-specific regulations regarding the sale of vehicles by a manufacturer.\nWe sold approximately 7% of our vehicles directly to our end customers in the year ended December 31, 2020. Going forward, we intend to focus on leveraging volume sales through dealers; however, we will continue to sell vehicles directly to end customers. Sales to both dealers and end customers require us to comply with state-specific regulations regarding the sale of vehicles by a manufacturer, including licensing and registration requirements. State laws that regulate the distribution and sale of motor vehicles by the manufacturer vary, and ensuring compliance is time-consuming and costly. Moreover, for customers living in states where we are prohibited from selling directly from within the state, we will have to consummate sales at facilities in a state that allows direct manufacturer-to-consumer sales and deliver the vehicle to the end user via a common carrier. As such, we may be required to either acquire and maintain a facility in multiple states, or incur additional costs of delivery of the vehicle, which consequently increases the cost and/or sales price of our vehicles and makes our vehicles less desirable to end-customers.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness, or if we experience additional material weaknesses in the future, our business may be harmed.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for evaluating and reporting on the effectiveness of our system of internal control. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). As a public company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules that govern public companies. In particular, we are required to certify our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires us to furnish annually a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 and concluded our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020 due to the material weakness related to segregation of duties. Specifically, due to limited resources and headcount we did not have multiple people in the accounting function for a full segregation of duties. We have taken and continue to take remedial steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting by hiring additional personnel with added expertise in public company reporting and expect to conclude that the material weakness has been remediated as these individuals progress through the onboarding process.\nRemediation efforts place a significant burden on management and add increased pressure to our financial resources and processes. If we are unable to successfully remediate our existing material weakness or any additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that may be identified in the future in a timely manner, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected; our liquidity, our access to capital markets, the perceptions of our creditworthiness may be adversely affected; we may be unable to maintain or regain compliance with applicable securities laws, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market; we may be subject to regulatory investigations and penalties; investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting; our reputation may be harmed; and our stock price may decline.\nOur failure to timely and effectively implement controls and procedures required by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs a public company, we are required to provide management\u2019s attestation on internal controls. The standards required for a public company under Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are significantly more stringent than those that were required of us as a private company. We continue to implement additional finance, accounting, and business operating systems, procedures, and controls as we grow our business and organization and to satisfy existing reporting requirements. If we fail to maintain or implement adequate controls, if we are unable to complete the required Section 404 assessment as to the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting in future Form 10-K filings, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in future Form 10-K filings, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, the Nasdaq or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary designs and intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed.\nOur ability to compete effectively is dependent in part upon our ability to obtain patent protection for our designs, products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on design patents, trademarks, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance these protections will be available in all cases or will be adequate to prevent our competitors from copying, reverse engineering or otherwise obtaining and using our designs, technology, proprietary rights or products. For example, the laws of certain countries in which our products, components and sub-assemblies are manufactured or licensed do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nTo prevent substantial unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, it may be necessary to prosecute actions for infringement and/or misappropriation of our trade secrets and/or proprietary rights against third parties. Any such action could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and management\u2019s attention, and there can be no assurance we will be successful in such action. Furthermore, our current and potential competitors may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights than we do. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our trade secrets and/or intellectual property.\nIn addition, third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, or applications for any of the foregoing. There can be no assurance that our competitors or customers will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology or design around our proprietary rights. In each case, our ability to compete could be significantly impaired.\nWe are dependent on the manufacturing license we have obtained from Cenntro and may need to obtain rights to other intellectual property in the future. If we fail to obtain licenses we need or fail to comply with our obligations in the agreement under which we licensed intellectual property and other rights from third parties, we could lose our ability to manufacture our vehicles.\nCenntro owns the design of the AYRO 411 model and has granted us an exclusive license to manufacture AYRO 411 model for sale in North America. Our business is dependent on such license, and if we fail to comply with our obligations to maintain that license, our business will be substantially harmed. Under the Manufacturing License Agreement, dated April 27, 2017 and further modified on March 22, 2020, between Cenntro and us, we are granted an exclusive license to manufacture and sell AYRO 411 in the United States, and we are required to purchase the minimum volume of product units from Cenntro, among other obligations. No assurance can be given that we will be able to meet the required quota and maintain our license granted by Cenntro and that our existing license will be extended on reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may need to license intellectual property from other third parties in the future for new vehicle models. No assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain such license or meet our obligations to maintain the licenses we may have to obtain from third parties in the future. If we were to lose or otherwise be unable to maintain these licenses for any reason, it would halt our ability to manufacture and sell our vehicles or may prohibit development of our future models. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nIn addition, if we do not own the patents or patent applications that we license, as is the case with AYRO 411\u2019s patents, we may need to rely upon our licensors to properly prosecute and maintain those patent applications and prevent infringement of those patents. If our licensors are unable to adequately protect their proprietary intellectual property we license from legal challenges, or if we are unable to enforce such licensed intellectual property against infringement or alternative technologies, we will not be able to compete effectively in the electric vehicle markets we are targeting.\nMany of our proprietary designs are in digital form and a breach of our computer systems could result in these designs being stolen.\nIf our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to private or proprietary data is otherwise obtained, our proprietary designs could be stolen. Because we hold many of these designs in digital form on our servers, there exists an inherent risk that an unauthorized third party could conduct a security breach resulting in the theft of our proprietary information. While we have taken steps to protect our proprietary information, because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any or all of these issues could negatively impact our competitive advantage and our ability to obtain new customers, thereby adversely affecting our financial results.\nOur proprietary designs are susceptible to reverse engineering by our competitors.\nMuch of the value of our proprietary rights is derived from our vast library of design specifications. While we consider our design specifications to be protected by various proprietary, trade secret and intellectual property laws, such information is susceptible to reverse engineering by our competitors. We may not be able to prevent our competitors from developing competing design specifications, and the cost of enforcing these rights may be significant. If we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary designs, our financial condition and operating results could suffer.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets or know-how, such proprietary information may be used by others to compete against us.\nWe consider trade secrets, including confidential and unpatented know-how and designs important to the maintenance of our competitive position. We protect trade secrets and confidential and unpatented know-how, in part, by customarily entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to such knowledge, such as our employees, outside technical and commercial collaborators, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to maintain confidentiality and assign their inventions to us. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches.\nLegal proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement and other challenges may require us to spend substantial time and money and could harm our business.\nThe vehicle design and manufacturing industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies. We may become subject to lawsuits alleging that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. The nature of claims contained in unpublished patent filings around the world is unknown to us, and it is not possible to know which countries patent holders may choose for the extension of their filings under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or other mechanisms. To the extent that we have previously incorporated third-party technology and/or know-how into certain products for which we do not have sufficient license rights, we could incur substantial litigation costs, be forced to pay substantial damages or royalties, or even be forced to cease sales in the event any owner of such technology or know-how were to challenge our subsequent sale of such products (and any progeny thereof). In addition, to the extent that we discover or have discovered third-party patents that may be applicable to products or processes in development, we may need to take steps to avoid claims of possible infringement, including obtaining non-infringement or invalidity opinions and, when necessary, re-designing or re-engineering products. However, we cannot assure you that these precautions will allow us to successfully avoid infringement claims. We may also be subject to claims based on the actions of employees and consultants with respect to the usage or disclosure of intellectual property learned from other employers. Third parties may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us or against our customers or channel partners for which we may be liable.\nOur involvement in intellectual property litigation could result in significant expense to us, adversely affect the development of sales of the challenged product or intellectual property and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation or defense of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. In the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation, we may, among other things, be required to:\n\u25cf pay substantial damages;\n\u25cf cease the development, manufacture, use, sale or importation of products that infringe upon other patented intellectual property;\n\u25cf expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing intellectual property;\n\u25cf discontinue processes incorporating infringing technology; or\n\u25cf obtain licenses to the infringing intellectual property, which licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe are generally obligated to indemnify our sales channel partners, customers, suppliers and contractors for certain expenses and liabilities resulting from intellectual property infringement claims regarding our products, which could force us to incur substantial costs.\nWe have agreed, and expect to continue to agree, to indemnify our sales channel partners and customers for certain intellectual property infringement claims regarding our products. As a result, in the case of infringement claims against these sales channel partners and end-customers, we could be required to indemnify them for losses resulting from such claims or to refund amounts they have paid to us. Our sales channel partners and other end-customers in the future may seek indemnification from us in connection with infringement claims brought.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nExchange rate fluctuations may materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate internationally and are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies, particularly the Chinese Renminbi. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and, as a result, financial line items, if not in the U.S. dollar, are converted into U.S. dollars at applicable foreign exchange rates. As our business grows, we expect that at least some of our revenues and expenses will be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Therefore, unfavorable developments in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other relevant currencies could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe pay Cenntro in U.S. dollars; however, the per-unit price of the sub-assemblies we must pay Cenntro may be affected due to the exchange rate fluctuations. The value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions in China and by China\u2019s foreign exchange policies. Historically, the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar has fluctuated significantly, and it is difficult to predict how market forces or Chinese or U.S. government policy may impact such exchange rate in the future. As of December 31, 2020, the Renminbi was valued at 6.53 against the U.S. dollar.\nVery limited hedging options are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any material hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited, and we may not be able to adequately hedge our exposure or at all.\nOur international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur international operations subject us to a variety of risks and challenges, including: increased management, travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with having international operations; reliance on sales channel partners; increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; compliance with foreign laws and regulations; compliance with U.S. laws and regulations for foreign operations; and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and practical difficulties of enforcing rights abroad. Any of these risks could adversely affect our international operations, reduce our international sales or increase our operating costs, adversely affecting our business, operating results and financial condition and growth prospects.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets due to licensing requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nOur products are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. Exports of our products must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. If we violate these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges, fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers, and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. In addition, if our channel partners, agents or consultants fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or authorizations, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular sale may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Changes in our products or changes in applicable export or import laws and regulations may also create delays in the introduction and sale of our products in international markets, prevent our end-customers with international operations from deploying our products or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change in export or import laws and regulations, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing laws and regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such laws and regulations, could also result in decreased use of our products, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential end-customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to governmental import duties that could significantly increase our costs.\nThe majority of our raw materials for our vehicles are shipped from the People\u2019s Republic of China. U.S./China trade relations are in a highly volatile state of uncertainty which could significantly affect the tariffs applied to our products. In 2018, the United States government announced tariffs on certain steel and aluminum products, technological hardware, as well as automotive parts imported into the United States, which has led to reciprocal tariffs imposed by the European Union and other governments on products imported from the United States. The United States government has implemented tariffs on goods imported from China, and additional tariffs on goods imported from China are under consideration.\nThe battery industry (both lithium-ion and lead acid-based), as well as many of the components of our vehicles, have been subjected to tariffs implemented by the U.S. government on goods imported from China. If the United States and China are not able to resolve their differences, new and additional tariffs may be put in place on additional products, including raw materials we use to manufacture our vehicles. If additional tariffs and related taxes are applied to the cost of imports from China, our costs will continue to increase, and we may be required to substantially increase the sales prices of our vehicles. An increase in sales prices of our vehicles would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. If we are unable to increase the sales prices of our vehicles to reflect the increase in the costs of the vehicles, it will result in lower gross margins on our vehicles.\nNew regulations or standards or changes in existing regulations or standards in the United States or internationally related to our suppliers\u2019 products may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and future sales, and could place additional burdens on the operations of our business.\nOur suppliers\u2019 products are subject to governmental regulations in many jurisdictions. To achieve and maintain market acceptance, our suppliers\u2019 products must continue to comply with these statutory regulations and many industry standards. As these regulations and standards evolve, and if new regulations or standards are implemented, our suppliers may have to modify their products. The failure of their products to comply, or delays in compliance, with the existing and evolving industry regulations and standards could prevent or delay introduction of our vehicles, which could harm our business. Supplier uncertainty regarding future policies may also affect demand for electric vehicles, including our vehicles. Moreover, channel partners or customers may require us, or we may otherwise deem it necessary or advisable, to alter our products to address actual or anticipated changes in the regulatory environment. Our inability to alter our products to address these requirements and any regulatory changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nWe have international operations. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Practices in the local business communities of many countries outside the United States have a level of government corruption that is greater than that found in the developed world. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, and we have established policies and procedures designed to monitor compliance with these anti-bribery law requirements; however, we cannot assure that our policies and procedures will protect us from potential reckless or criminal acts committed by individual employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for anti-bribery law violations, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business.", "PERMNO": 90640, "SIC": 7500, "TIC": "DCAR"}
