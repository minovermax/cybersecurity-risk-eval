RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risks, together with all the other information in this periodic report, including our financial statements and notes thereto and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d before you invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks actually materializes, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Limited Operating History, Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and if we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market value of our common stock will likely decline.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We have not generated any product revenues and we do not expect to generate any product revenues for the foreseeable future. We have incurred losses in each year since our founding in 2007 and we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. The amount of future losses is uncertain. All of our product candidates are in development, and none has been approved for sale. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, including our preclinical and nonclinical development activities, and expect that it will be many years, if ever, before we have a product candidate ready for commercialization. To date, we have derived all of our funding from our collaboration with our former parent company, Asuragen, Inc., or Asuragen, private placements of preferred stock and government grants for research and development. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $25.0 million. Since inception, we have incurred net losses leading to an accumulated deficit of approximately $76.5 million as of December 31, 2015.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future as we expand our clinical development plan for MRX34 as a mono therapy, pursue development of MRX34 as a combination therapy, conduct research and development of other product candidates and pursue marketing approval for MRX34 in the future. If we obtain marketing approval of MRX34, we also expect to incur significant sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing expenses. Even after obtaining such marketing approval, our products may never gain sufficient market acceptance and adequate market share. If we fail to succeed in any of these activities or our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials, do not gain regulatory approval or do not achieve significant market acceptance following regulatory approval and commercialization, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market value of our common stock will likely decline. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or whether we will become profitable.\nOur short operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that was founded in 2007 and did not exist as a standalone company until 2009. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, acquiring and developing our technology, identifying and evaluating potential product candidates and delivery technologies, undertaking nonclinical studies, filing an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and conducting the Phase 1 clinical trial of our most\nadvanced product candidate, MRX34. Except for MRX34, all of our product candidates are still in preclinical development. We have not yet demonstrated our ability to initiate clinical trials for product candidates other than MRX34, or successfully complete any clinical trials, including large-scale, pivotal clinical trials, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial scale medicine, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. Typically, it takes many years to develop one new product candidate from the time it is discovered to when it is available for treating patients. Consequently, any predictions about our future success or viability, or any evaluation of our business or prospects, may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history. In addition, as a new business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown challenges. We will need to transition from a company with a research focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We may not be successful in such a transition.\nWe will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or terminate our product development, other operations or commercialization efforts.\nDeveloping biopharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical and nonclinical studies and clinical trials, is an expensive and highly uncertain process that takes years to complete. Our expenses will increase substantially as we expand our clinical development plan for MRX34 as a mono therapy, pursue development of MRX34 as a combination therapy, conduct research and development of other product candidates and pursue marketing approval for MRX34 in the future. Additional clinical trials, including one or more late-stage pivotal trials, will be required to obtain potential marketing approval for MRX34, and the costs of any future trials may be more expensive and time consuming than our current trial. If we obtain marketing approval of MRX34, we also expect to incur significant sales, marketing, distribution and outsourced manufacturing expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had working capital of $84.6 million and cash and cash equivalents of $89.7 million. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our available cash at such date are sufficient to fund our anticipated levels of operation for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements for the period for which we expect our existing resources to support our operations may vary significantly from what we expect. For example, our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory agencies to perform studies and trials in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Our funds at December 31, 2015 will not be sufficient to obtain marketing approval for MRX34. As a result, we will be required to obtain additional financing in the future, which we may obtain through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, a credit facility, government grants and contracts and/or strategic collaborations. If we are required to secure additional capital, such additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize future product candidates. Additional financing may not be available to us when we need it or it may not be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or form favorable collaborations, when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials, research and development programs or our commercialization efforts, including with respect to MRX34.\nAdditionally, our future financing requirements will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7\nthe demonstration of further clinical proof-of-concept with our product candidates, including MRX34, in one or more cancer types or other indications;\n\u00b7\nthe rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials, preclinical and nonclinical studies and other discovery and research and development activities;\n\u00b7\nthe successful outcome of one or more pivotal clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy of our product candidates, including MRX34;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of, and costs involved in, seeking and obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation;\n\u00b7\nour ability to practice our technology without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties;\n\u00b7\nour ability to enter into additional collaboration, licensing, government or other arrangements and the terms and timing of such arrangements;\n\u00b7\nthe potential need to acquire, by acquisition or in-licensing, other products or technologies; and\n\u00b7\nthe emergence of competing technologies or other adverse market developments.\nFuture capital requirements will also depend on the extent to which we acquire or invest in additional complementary businesses, products and technologies. We currently have no understandings, commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, credit facilities, government grants and contracts and/or strategic collaborations.\nTo raise capital, we may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the then-current trading price of our common stock. As a result, our common stockholders would experience immediate dilution upon the purchase of any shares of our common stock sold at such discount. In addition, as opportunities present themselves, we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future, including the issuance of debt securities, preferred stock or common stock. Whether or not we issue additional shares of common stock at a discount, any issuance of common stock will, and any issuance of other equity securities, securities convertible into equity securities or options, warrants or other rights to purchase common stock may, result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline. New investors could also gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. Debt securities may also contain covenants that restrict our operational flexibility, impose liens or other restrictions on our assets, restrict our ability to incur additional debt, impose limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property or impose other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our business and could also cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOther than our collaboration with our former parent company, Asuragen, private placements of preferred stock, and offerings of common stock, the only external source of funds to date has been state and federal government grants for research and development. The grants have been, and any future government grants and contracts we may receive may be, subject to the risks and contingencies set forth below under the risk factor entitled \u201cReliance on government funding for our programs may add uncertainty to our research and commercialization efforts with respect to those programs that are tied to such funding and may impose requirements that limit our ability to take certain actions, increase the costs of commercialization and production of product candidates developed under those programs and subject us to potential financial penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d Although we might apply for government and private contracts and grants in the future, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining additional grants or contracts for MRX34 or any other product candidates or programs.\nRisks Related to Product Development and Commercialization\nThe approach we are taking to discover and develop novel therapeutics using microRNA is unproven and may never lead to marketable products.\nThe scientific discoveries that form the basis for our efforts to discover and develop new drugs are relatively recent. To date, neither we nor any other company has received regulatory approval to market therapeutics utilizing microRNA. The scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing drugs based on these discoveries is both preliminary and limited. Successful development of microRNA-based products by us will require solving a number of issues, including providing suitable methods of stabilizing the microRNA material and delivering it into target cells in the human body. In addition, any compounds that we develop may not demonstrate in patients the chemical and pharmacological properties ascribed to them in laboratory and nonclinical studies, and they may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or even harmful ways. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize product candidates based upon our technological approach, we may not become profitable and the value of our common stock may decline.\nFurther, the FDA has relatively limited experience with microRNA-based therapeutics. No regulatory authority has granted approval to any person or entity, including us, to market and commercialize microRNA therapeutics, which may increase the complexity, uncertainty and length of the regulatory approval process for our product candidates. If our microRNA technologies prove to be ineffective, unsafe or commercially unviable, our entire pipeline would have little, if any, value, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFurther, our exclusive focus on microRNA technology for developing products as opposed to multiple, more proven technologies for drug development increases the risk associated with our business. If we are not successful in developing a product candidate using microRNA technology, we may not be able to identify and successfully implement an alternative product development strategy.\nWe are heavily dependent on the success of our lead product candidate, MRX34, which is in Phase 1 clinical development.\nWe currently have no products approved for sale and have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of MRX34. The clinical development of MRX34 began in April 2013 with a multi-center Phase 1 clinical trial that is currently enrolling patients with advanced stage solid cancers. We have also included in the Phase 1 clinical trial a separate cohort of patients with hematological malignancies, which may include patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, acute myelogenous leukemia, acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia in accelerated or blast phase, multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome. The primary objectives of the Phase 1 clinical trial, including the hematological malignancy cohort, are to establish the maximum tolerated dose and an appropriate dose for Phase 2 clinical trials. The secondary objectives of the Phase 1 clinical trial are to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of MRX34 after intravenous dosing as well as to assess any biological and clinical activity.\nOur prospects are substantially dependent on our ability to develop and commercialize MRX34. Our ability to timely develop and effectively commercialize MRX34 will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nsuccessful completion of our Phase 1 clinical trial or other clinical trials, which will depend substantially upon the satisfactory performance of third-party contractors;\n\u00b7\nsuccessful demonstration of further clinical proof-of-concept with MRX34 in one or more cancer types;\n\u00b7\nsuccessful outcome of one or more pivotal clinical trials required for regulatory approval demonstrating safety and efficacy of MRX34;\n\u00b7\nreceipt of marketing approvals for MRX34 from the FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States;\n\u00b7\nestablishing commercial manufacturing capabilities, for example, by making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully launching commercial sales of the product, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u00b7\nacceptance of the product by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u00b7\nestablishing market share while competing with other therapies;\n\u00b7\na continued acceptable safety and adverse event profile of the product following regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nqualifying for, identifying, registering, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims covering the product; and\n\u00b7\nmanufacturing, marketing, selling and using MRX34 and practicing our technology without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties, or successfully defending against claims alleging such infringement.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner, or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to commercialize MRX34, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have not previously submitted a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA, or similar drug approval filings to comparable foreign authorities, for any product candidate, and we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Further, our product candidates may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical trials. If we do not receive regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approvals to market one or more of our product candidates, our revenues will be dependent upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval and have commercial rights. If the markets for patient subsets that we are targeting are not as significant as we estimate, we may not generate significant revenues from sales of such products, if approved. Successful development of MRX34 or other product candidates for additional indications will be subject to these same risks.\nIf we are not successful in discovering, developing and commercializing additional product candidates, our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives would be impaired.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our efforts will focus on the MRX34 Phase 1 clinical trial and the initiation of several Phase 2 studies, a key element of our strategy is to discover, develop and potentially commercialize a portfolio of product candidates to treat cancer and other indications. We are seeking to do so through our internal research programs and are exploring, and intend to explore in the future, strategic partnerships for the development of new products. Other than MRX34, all of our other potential product candidates remain in the discovery and preclinical study stages. Research programs to identify product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources, whether or not any product candidates are ultimately identified. Our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for many reasons, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates;\n\u00b7\ncompetitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete;\n\u00b7\nproduct candidates we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights;\n\u00b7\na product candidate may, on further study, be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory criteria;\n\u00b7\na product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\n\u00b7\na product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third-party payors.\nIf we are unsuccessful in identifying and developing additional product candidates, our potential for growth may be impaired.\nWe may use our financial and human resources to pursue a particular research program or product candidate and fail to capitalize on programs or product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and human resources, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with certain programs or product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or more profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and future product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. We may also enter into strategic alliance agreements to develop and commercialize certain of our programs and potential product candidates in indications with potentially large commercial markets. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic alliance, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate, or we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement.\nThe regulatory approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain, and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our drug products under applicable regulatory requirements. The denial or delay of any such approval would delay commercialization of our drug products and adversely impact our ability to generate revenue, our business and our results of operations.\nThe development, research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive and evolving regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities in the United States, principally the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, which regulations differ from country to country. Neither we nor any future collaborator is permitted to market MRX34 or any other product candidate in the United States until we receive regulatory approval of an NDA from the FDA.\nObtaining regulatory approval of an NDA can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. Prior to obtaining approval to commercialize a drug candidate in the United States or abroad, we or our collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies, that such drug candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. The number of nonclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for FDA approval varies depending on the drug candidate, the disease or condition that the drug candidate is designed to address, and the regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate. Results from nonclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the nonclinical or clinical data for our drug candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Administering drug candidates to humans may produce undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying approval of a drug candidate for any or all indications. The FDA may also require us to conduct additional studies or trials for our product candidates either prior to or post-approval, such as additional drug-drug interaction studies or safety or efficacy studies or trials, or it may object to elements of our clinical development program such as the number of subjects in our current clinical trials from the United States.\nWe expect to complete enrollment in the Phase 1 clinical trial and to initiate enrollment in a Phase 1b translational medicine study and the Phase 2 clinical trials for our lead product candidate, MRX34, by the end of 2016, and our business currently depends substantially on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of MRX34. We currently have no drug products approved for sale, and we may never obtain regulatory approval to commercialize MRX34.\nThe FDA or any foreign regulatory bodies can delay, limit or deny approval of MRX34 or require us to conduct additional nonclinical or clinical testing or abandon a program for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s disagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nnegative or ambiguous results from our clinical trials or results that may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory agencies for approval;\n\u00b7\nserious and unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by individuals using drugs similar to our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nour inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body that MRX34 is safe and effective for the proposed indication;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s disagreement with the interpretation of data from nonclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nour inability to demonstrate the clinical and other benefits of MRX34 outweigh any safety or other perceived risks;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s requirement for additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s disagreement regarding the formulation, labeling and/or the specifications of MRX34;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s failure to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract; or\n\u00b7\nthe potential for approval policies or regulations of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agencies to significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nOf the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA or other regulatory approval processes and are commercialized. The lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market MRX34, which would significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nEven if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval of an NDA or foreign marketing application for MRX34, the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional clinical trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and/or the implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, which may be required to ensure safe use of the drug after approval. The FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency also may approve MRX34 for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than we originally requested, and the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agency may not approve the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of MRX34. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval would delay or prevent commercialization of MRX34 and would materially adversely impact our business and prospects.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Furthermore, we rely on contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials. While we have agreements with our CROs governing their committed activities, and the ability to audit their performance, we have limited influence over their actual performance. Failure or delay can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. Success in nonclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and the results of clinical trials by other parties may not be indicative of the results in trials we may conduct. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including biotechnology companies, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier nonclinical or clinical studies. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, nonclinical findings made while clinical studies were underway and safety or efficacy observations made in clinical studies, including previously unreported adverse events. The results of preclinical, nonclinical and early clinical studies of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical and initial clinical trials. Notwithstanding any potential promising results in earlier studies, we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Even if our clinical trials are completed, the results may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nAlthough we have an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial for MRX34 that is expected to complete enrollment and planned Phase 1b translational medicine study and Phase 2 clinical trials that are expected to initiate enrollment by the end of 2016, we may experience delays in these trials and we cannot be certain that the trial or any other future clinical trials for MRX34 or other product candidates will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed or aborted for a variety of reasons, including delay or failure related to:\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities disagreeing as to the design or implementation of our clinical studies;\n\u00b7\nobtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u00b7\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u00b7\nobtaining institutional review board, or IRB, or equivalent approval at each site;\n\u00b7\nrecruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u00b7\nhaving patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u00b7\nclinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n\u00b7\naddressing patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;\n\u00b7\naddressing any conflicts with new or existing laws or regulations;\n\u00b7\nadding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites; or\n\u00b7\nmanufacturing sufficient quantities of product candidate for use in clinical trials.\nPatient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials and is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential\nadvantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs or treatments that may be approved for the indications we are investigating.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by the Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may suspend or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nFurther, conducting clinical trials in foreign countries, as we currently do for MRX34, presents additional risks that may delay completion of our clinical trials. These risks include the failure of enrolled patients in foreign countries to adhere to clinical protocol as a result of differences in healthcare services or cultural customs, managing additional administrative burdens associated with foreign regulatory schemes, as well as political and economic risks relevant to such foreign countries.\nIf we experience delays in the completion, or termination, of any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates may be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed or not realized at all. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nIf we are required to suspend or discontinue clinical trials due to side effects or other safety risks, or if we are required to conduct studies on the long-term effects associated with the use of MRX34 or other product candidates, our ability to commercialize our product candidates could be adversely affected.\nOur clinical trials, including our Phase 1 clinical trial for MRX34, the planned initiation of a Phase 1b translational medicine study and several Phase 2 studies, or other trials our strategic partners or CROs may conduct, may be suspended or terminated at any time for a number of safety-related reasons. For example, we may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that our product candidates present an unacceptable safety risk to the clinical trial patients. In addition, IRBs or regulatory agencies may order the temporary discontinuation or termination of our clinical trials at any time if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, including if they present an unacceptable safety risk to patients. Administering any product candidate to humans may produce undesirable side effects. The existence of undesirable side effects resulting from our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities, such as the FDA, to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of our product candidates and could result in the FDA or other regulatory agencies denying further development or approval of our product candidates for any or all indications.\nWe have not conducted complete studies on the long-term effects associated with the use of MRX34 or any other product candidate. Studies of these long-term effects may be required for regulatory approval and such requirement would delay our introduction of MRX34 or other product candidates into the market. These studies could also be required at any time after regulatory approval of a product candidate. Absence of long-term data may also limit the approved uses of a product, if any, to short-term use. MRX34 or any other product candidate may prove to be unsafe for human use, which would materially harm our business.\nCertain oligonucleotide therapeutics and liposomal drug delivery products have shown injection site reactions, infusion reactions and pro-inflammatory effects and may also lead to impairment of organ function, including kidney or liver function. There is a risk that our current and future product candidates may induce similar adverse events, or require pre- or co-administration of other drugs to minimize such effects, which pre- or co-administration might adversely affect the benefits of our product or add additional side effects to the treatment regimens. Results of our clinical trials could\nreveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of these or other side effects. In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all indications. Drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects significantly.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nAs with many pharmaceutical products and product candidates under development, MRX34 or our other potential product candidates may produce undesirable side effects or adverse reactions or events. In the event we or others identify undesirable side effects caused by one of our product candidates, any of the following adverse events could occur:\n\u00b7\nwe may be required, or we may decide, to halt or delay further clinical development of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all indications; or\n\u00b7\nproduct-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims.\nIf MRX34 or our other potential product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to recall a product or change the way such product is administered to patients;\n\u00b7\nadditional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of the particular product or the manufacturing processes for the product or any component thereof;\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to implement a REMS or create a Medication Guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u00b7\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u00b7\nthe product may become less competitive; and\n\u00b7\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of the foregoing events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and result in the loss of significant revenues to us, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nOur clinical drug development program may not uncover all possible adverse events that patients who take MRX34 or other product candidates may experience. The number of subjects exposed to MRX34 or other product candidates and the average exposure time in the clinical development program may be inadequate to detect rare adverse events, or chance findings, that may only be detected once the product is administered to more patients and for greater periods of time.\nClinical trials by their nature utilize a sample of the potential patient population. However, with a limited number of subjects and limited duration of exposure, we cannot be fully assured that rare and severe side effects of MRX34 or other product candidates will be uncovered. Such rare and severe side effects may only be uncovered with a significantly larger number of patients exposed to the drug. If such safety problems occur or are identified after MRX34 or another product candidate reaches the market, the FDA may require that we amend the labeling of the product or recall the product, or may even withdraw approval for the product.\nWe face potential product liability, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability and costs. If the use or misuse of our product candidates harms patients, or is perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to our product candidates, our regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims. If we are unable to obtain adequate insurance or are required to pay for liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limits of, our insurance coverage, a material liability claim could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe use or misuse of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. There is a risk that our product candidates may induce adverse events. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. Certain oligonucleotide therapeutics and liposomal drug delivery products have shown injection site reactions, infusion reactions, and pro-inflammatory effects, and may also lead to organ dysfunction, including impairment of kidney or liver function. There is a risk that our future product candidates may induce similar adverse events. Patients with the diseases targeted by our product candidates are often already in severe and advanced stages of disease and have both known and unknown significant pre-existing and potentially life-threatening health risks. During the course of treatment, patients may suffer adverse events, including death, for reasons that may be related to our product candidates. Such events could subject us to costly litigation, require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, delay, negatively impact or end our opportunity to receive or maintain regulatory approval to market our products, or require us to suspend or abandon our commercialization efforts. Even in a circumstance in which we do not believe that an adverse event is related to our products, the investigation into the circumstance may be time-consuming or inconclusive. These investigations may interrupt our sales efforts, delay our regulatory approval process in other countries, or impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals our product candidates receive or maintain. As a result of these factors, a product liability claim, even if successfully defended, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAlthough we have product liability insurance that we feel is appropriate for our stage of development, which covers our clinical trials in the United States, for up to $1 million per occurrence, up to an aggregate limit of $5 million, our insurance may be insufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer, and we will be required to increase our product liability insurance coverage for our advanced clinical trials that we plan to initiate. We have obtained an additional product liability insurance policy for our clinical trials in the Republic of Korea. If and when we obtain marketing approval for product candidates, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products. We do not know whether we will be able to continue to obtain product liability coverage and obtain expanded coverage if we require it, in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability, on acceptable terms, or at all. We may not have sufficient resources to pay for any liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limits of, our insurance coverage. Where we have provided indemnities in favor of third parties under our agreements with them, there is also a risk that these third parties could incur liability and bring a claim under such indemnities. An individual may bring a product liability claim against us alleging that one of our product candidates or products causes, or is claimed to have caused, an injury or is found to be unsuitable for consumer use. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers\ninherent in the product, negligence, strict liability, and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in:\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial volunteers, investigators, patients or trial sites or limitations on approved indications;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to commercialize, or if commercialized, decreased demand for, our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nif commercialized, product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions or the need for product modification;\n\u00b7\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u00b7\nloss of revenues;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial costs of litigation, including monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u00b7\nliabilities that substantially exceed our product liability insurance, which we would then be required to pay ourselves;\n\u00b7\nan increase in our product liability insurance rates or the inability to maintain insurance coverage in the future on acceptable terms, if at all;\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from our business; and\n\u00b7\ndamage to our reputation and the reputation of our products and our technology.\nProduct liability claims may subject us to the foregoing and other risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCurrently, our product candidates are expensive to produce and are expensive relative to presently-marketed therapeutics targeting similar indications.\nTo date, our proposed product candidates have only been manufactured at a scale that is adequate to supply our research activities and early-stage clinical trials. As with many companies conducting Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials or preclinical studies on product candidates, the current cost of each treatment is expensive relative to presently-marketed therapeutics targeting similar indications. We cannot assure you that we will be able to scale the manufacturing of our products during future clinical trials or commercialization in order to achieve a treatment price that would allow for commercial acceptance. In the event our product candidates cannot be manufactured in sufficient commercial quantities at a competitive price, our future prospects could be significantly impacted and our financial prospects would be materially harmed.\nEven if a product candidate does obtain regulatory approval, that product candidate may never achieve market acceptance or commercial success.\nEven if we obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals, and are able to launch MRX34 or any other product candidate commercially, the product candidate may not achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, patient advocacy groups and third-party payors and, ultimately, may not be commercially successful. Market acceptance of any product candidate for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe efficacy and safety of the product candidate as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved;\n\u00b7\nacceptance by physicians, patients, operators of treatment facilities and parties responsible for reimbursement of the product candidate as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u00b7\nthe potential and perceived advantages of the product candidate, including the cost of treatment and benefits over alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nthe safety of the product candidate seen in a broader patient group, including use outside the approved indications;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities;\n\u00b7\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u00b7\nthe tolerance of the products by patients, including prevalence and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of the product and the ability to meet market demand; and\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.\nAny failure by MRX34 or any other product candidate that obtains regulatory approval to achieve market acceptance or commercial success would adversely affect our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct some of our nonclinical and all of our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize any of our product candidates.\nAlthough we conduct certain nonclinical studies, we currently do not have the ability to independently conduct nonclinical studies that comply with the regulatory requirements known as good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements. We also do not currently have the ability to independently conduct any clinical trials. The FDA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as current good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials, in order to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. We rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories and other third parties, such as CROs, to conduct GLP-compliant nonclinical studies and GCP-compliant clinical trials on our product candidates properly and on time. While we will have agreements governing their activities, we control only certain aspects of their activities and have limited influence over their actual performance. The third parties with whom we contract for execution of our GLP nonclinical studies and our GCP clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of these studies and trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. These third parties are not our employees and, except for restrictions imposed by our contracts with such third parties, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct our GLP-compliant preclinical and nonclinical studies and GCP-compliant clinical trials, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our GLP preclinical and nonclinical studies and GCP clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol and applicable laws and regulations, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.\nMany of the third parties with whom we contract may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other drug development activities that could harm our competitive position. If the third parties conducting our GLP preclinical or nonclinical studies or our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, experience work stoppages, do not meet expected deadlines, terminate their agreements with us or need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they\nobtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical trial protocols or to GCPs, or for any other reason, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties. This could be difficult, costly or impossible, and our nonclinical studies or clinical trials may need to be extended, delayed, terminated or repeated. As a result we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval in a timely fashion, or at all, for the applicable product candidate, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply MRX34 and other product candidates for us. If our supplier or manufacturer fails to perform adequately or fulfill our needs, or if these agreements are terminated by the third parties, we may be required to incur significant costs and devote significant efforts to find new suppliers or manufacturers. We may also face delays in the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe do not currently independently conduct manufacturing activities for our product candidates, including MRX34. We rely upon single source third-party contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply our product candidates. We currently have a relationship with two suppliers for clinical supply of the drug substance for our miR-34 mimic. Polymun Scientific Immunbiologische Forschung GmbH, or Polymun, located in Austria, is the exclusive manufacturer of our MRX34 drug product. Further, we rely on our contract manufacturers to manage the supply chain for the raw materials used in the manufacture of the drug substance and drug product.\nAny manufacturers of the drug substance and drug product for our product candidates must comply with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our component materials may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. We do not directly control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMPs. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no direct control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. The FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies at any time may also implement new standards, or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards for manufacture, packaging or testing of products. We have little control over a manufacturer\u2019s compliance with these regulations and standards. However, a failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any product supplied is compromised due to our manufacturer\u2019s failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our products, and we may be held liable for any injuries sustained as a result. In addition, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory agency does not approve our contract manufacturer\u2019s facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws its approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would negatively impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, or market our product candidates, if approved. Any of these factors could cause a delay of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, approvals or commercialization of our product candidates or entail higher costs or impair our reputation.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products in compliance with cGMP regulations requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, including difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product candidate and quality assurance testing, or shortages of qualified personnel. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties or otherwise fail to comply with their obligations to us or under applicable regulations, our ability to provide study materials in our nonclinical studies and clinical trials would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of nonclinical study or clinical trial materials could delay the completion of our nonclinical studies and clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining our nonclinical study and clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to conduct nonclinical studies, commence new trials at significant additional expense or terminate the studies and trials completely.\nWe currently believe that our third party suppliers have the necessary expertise to produce our MRX34 drug substance and drug product in sufficient quantity and of acceptable quality to support our development program through at least Phase 3 clinical trials and possibly through commercialization of MRX34. However, our current agreements with our suppliers do not provide for the entire supply of the drug necessary for additional clinical trials or for full-scale commercialization. In the event that we and our suppliers cannot agree to the terms and conditions for them to provide some or all of our clinical and commercial drug supply needs, or if our suppliers terminate their agreements with us in response to a breach by us or any other reason permitted under our agreements, we would not be able to manufacture the drug on a commercial scale until a qualified alternative supplier is identified, which could also delay the development of, and impair our ability to commercialize, our product candidates. Any supplier would be required to obtain regulatory approval of their manufacturing facilities, processes and quality systems before engaging in the commercial manufacture of a pharmaceutical product. Due to the complexity of the processes used to manufacture pharmaceutical products and product candidates, any potential third-party manufacturer may be unable to continue to pass or initially pass federal, state or international regulatory inspections in a cost-effective manner.\nAlthough we believe that appropriate alternative sources of supply exist for each of our current product candidates, the number of third-party suppliers with the necessary manufacturing and regulatory expertise and facilities is limited, and it could be expensive and take a significant amount of time to arrange for alternative suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. New suppliers of any drug would be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements and would need to have sufficient rights under applicable intellectual property laws to the method of manufacturing such ingredients. Obtaining the necessary FDA approvals or other qualifications under applicable regulatory requirements and ensuring non-infringement of third- party intellectual property rights could result in a significant interruption of supply and could require the new manufacturer to bear significant additional costs which may be passed on to us.\nThe failure of third-party manufacturers or suppliers to perform adequately or the termination of our arrangements with any of them may negatively and adversely affect our business.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured the product candidates ourselves, including:\n\u00b7\nthe inability to meet any product specifications and quality requirements consistently;\n\u00b7\na delay or inability to procure or expand sufficient manufacturing capacity;\n\u00b7\ncapacity related to the scale-up of manufacturing;\n\u00b7\nmanufacturing and product quality issues related to scale-up of manufacturing;\n\u00b7\ncosts and validation of new equipment and facilities required for scale-up;\n\u00b7\na failure to comply with cGMP and similar foreign standards;\n\u00b7\noperations of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier;\n\u00b7\ncarrier disruptions or increased costs that are beyond our control;\n\u00b7\nthe failure of third parties involved in the transportation, storage and distribution of our products, including the failure to deliver products under specified storage conditions and in a timely manner; and\n\u00b7\nthe possibility that our contract manufacturer, or third parties with access to their facilities, will have access to and may appropriate our trade secrets or other proprietary information.\nAny of these events could lead to clinical trial delays or failure to obtain regulatory approval, or impact our ability to successfully commercialize future products. Some of these events could be the basis for FDA action, including injunction, recall, seizure or total or partial suspension of production.\nWe may not be able to develop or identify a technology that can effectively deliver our miR-34 mimic or any other of our microRNA-based product candidates to the intended diseased cells or tissues, and any failure in such delivery technology could adversely affect and delay the development of MRX34 and our other product candidates.\nIn connection with our Phase 1 clinical trial of MRX34, we have used a SMARTICLES liposomal formulation to facilitate delivery to tumors. SMARTICLES has demonstrated successful tumor delivery of our miR-34 mimic in multiple mouse models of liver cancer, but we cannot be certain that the SMARTICLES technology will be capable of delivering adequate levels of our miR-34 mimic to tumors in patients to produce a therapeutic response. While we are continuing to evaluate the use of SMARTICLES in different indications, and additional delivery technologies that might enable us to target specific cancer cells with our product candidates, we cannot be certain whether we will be successful in developing such alternative delivery mechanisms. Our failure to effectively deliver any of our product candidates to the intended diseased cells or tissues could adversely affect and delay the development of our product candidates.\nWe currently have no sales and marketing staff or distribution organization. If we are unable to develop a sales and marketing and distribution capability on our own or through third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our future products.\nWe currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities or experience. To achieve commercial success for any approved product candidate, we must either develop a sales, marketing and distribution organization or outsource these functions to third parties. If we rely on third parties for marketing and distributing our approved products, any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties, which may not be successful and are only partially within our control and our product revenue may be lower than if we directly marketed or sold our products. If we are unable to enter into arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute product candidates for which we have received regulatory approval on acceptable terms or at all, we will need to market these products ourselves. This is likely to be expensive and logistically difficult, as it would require us to build our own sales, marketing and distribution capacity. We have no experience in this area, and if such efforts were necessary, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our future products. If we are not successful in commercializing our future products, either on our own or through third parties, any future product revenue will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may attempt to form collaborations in the future with respect to our product candidates, but we may not be able to do so, which may cause us to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nWe may attempt to form strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties with respect to our programs that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. For example, we may attempt to find a strategic partner for the development and/or commercialization of MRX34. We may face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners, and the negotiation process to secure appropriate terms is time-consuming and complex. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish such a strategic partnership for any product candidates and programs on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. This may be because our product candidates and programs may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort, our research and development pipeline may be viewed as insufficient, the competitive or intellectual property landscape may be viewed as too intense or risky, and/or third parties may not view our product candidates and programs as having sufficient potential for commercialization, including the likelihood of an adequate safety and efficacy profile.\nAny delays in identifying suitable collaborators and entering into agreements to develop and/or commercialize our product candidates could delay the development or commercialization of our product candidates, which may reduce their competitiveness even if they reach the market. Absent a collaboration partner, we would need to undertake development and/or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development and/or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which\nmay not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may not be able to develop our product candidates or bring them to market and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to realize the potential benefits of any collaboration.\nEven if we are successful in entering into a collaboration with respect to the development and/or commercialization of one or more product candidates, there is no guarantee that the collaboration will be successful. Collaborations may pose a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7\ncollaborators often have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to the collaboration, and may not commit sufficient resources to the development, marketing or commercialization of the product or products that are subject to the collaboration;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u00b7\nany such collaboration may significantly limit our share of potential future profits from the associated program, and may require us to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our current product candidates, potential products or proprietary technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may cease to devote resources to the development or commercialization of our product candidates if the collaborators view our product candidates as competitive with their own products or product candidates;\n\u00b7\ndisagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the course of development, might cause delays or termination of the development or commercialization of product candidates, and might result in legal proceedings, which would be time- consuming, distracting and expensive;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may be impacted by changes in their strategic focus or available funding, or business combinations involving them, which could cause them to divert resources away from the collaboration;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u00b7\nthe collaborations may not result in us achieving revenues to justify such transactions; and\n\u00b7\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for us to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidate.\nAs a result, a collaboration may not result in the successful development or commercialization of our product candidates.\nReliance on government funding for our programs may add uncertainty to our research and commercialization efforts with respect to those programs that are tied to such funding and may impose requirements that limit our ability to take certain actions, increase the costs of commercialization and production of product candidates developed under those programs and subject us to potential financial penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the course of our development of our product candidates, we have been funded in significant part through federal and state grants, including but not limited to the substantial funding we have received from the Texas Emerging Technology Fund and the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, or CPRIT. In addition to the funding we have received to date, we have applied and intend to continue to apply for federal and state grants to receive additional funding in the future. Contracts and grants funded by the U.S. government, state governments and their related agencies, including our contracts with the State of Texas pertaining to funds we have already received, include\nprovisions that reflect the government\u2019s substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including powers of the government to:\n\u00b7\nrequire repayment of all or a portion of the grant proceeds, in certain cases with interest, in the event we violate certain covenants pertaining to various matters that include any potential relocation outside of the State of Texas, failure to achieve certain milestones or to comply with terms relating to use of grant proceeds, or failure to comply with certain laws;\n\u00b7\nterminate agreements, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason;\n\u00b7\nreduce or modify the government\u2019s obligations under such agreements without the consent of the other party;\n\u00b7\nclaim rights, including intellectual property rights, in products and data developed under such agreements;\n\u00b7\naudit contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;\n\u00b7\nsuspend the contractor or grantee from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;\n\u00b7\nimpose U.S. manufacturing requirements for products that embody inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under such agreements;\n\u00b7\nimpose qualifications for the engagement of manufacturers, suppliers and other contractors as well as other criteria for reimbursements;\n\u00b7\nsuspend or debar the contractor or grantee from doing future business with the government;\n\u00b7\ncontrol and potentially prohibit the export of products;\n\u00b7\npursue criminal or civil remedies under the False Claims Act, False Statements Act and similar remedy provisions specific to government agreements; and\n\u00b7\nlimit the government\u2019s financial liability to amounts appropriated by the U.S. Congress on a fiscal-year basis, thereby leaving some uncertainty about the future availability of funding for a program even after it has been funded for an initial period.\nIn addition to those powers set forth above, the government funding we may receive could also impose requirements to make payments based upon sales of our products in the future. For example, under the terms of our 2010 award from CPRIT, we are required to pay CPRIT a portion of our revenues from sales of certain products by us, or received from our licensees or sublicensees, at a percentage in the low single digits until the aggregate amount of such payments equals a specified multiple of the grant amount, and thereafter at a rate of less than one percent, subject to our right, under certain circumstances, to make a one-time payment in a specified amount to CPRIT to buy out such payment obligations. See \u201cBusiness-Key Partnerships and Licenses\u201d for a description of this CPRIT agreement, which includes a description of our obligations to make royalty payments.\nWe may not have the right to prohibit the U.S. government from using certain technologies developed by us, and we may not be able to prohibit third-party companies, including our competitors, from using those technologies in providing products and services to the U.S. government. The U.S. government generally takes the position that it has the right to royalty-free use of technologies that are developed under U.S. government contracts. These and other provisions of government grants may also apply to intellectual property we license now or in the future.\nIn addition, government contracts and grants normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These requirements include, for example:\n\u00b7\nspecialized accounting systems unique to government contracts and grants;\n\u00b7\nmandatory financial audits and potential liability for price adjustments or recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent;\n\u00b7\npublic disclosures of certain contract and grant information, which may enable competitors to gain insights into our research program; and\n\u00b7\nmandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor standards, non-discrimination and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements.\nIf we fail to maintain compliance with any such requirements that may apply to us now or in the future, we may be subject to potential liability and to termination of our contracts.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third- party manufacturers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which may be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur third-party manufacturers\u2019 activities and our own activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including the components of our pharmaceutical product candidates, test samples and reagents, biological materials and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. We currently carry no insurance specifically covering environmental claims relating to the use of hazardous materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials and waste products comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from the use, storage, handling or disposal of hazardous materials. In the event of an accident, state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of these materials and/or interrupt our business operations. In addition, if an accident or environmental discharge occurs, or if we discover contamination caused by prior operations, including by prior owners and operators of properties we acquire, we could be liable for cleanup obligations, damages and fines. If such unexpected costs are substantial, this could significantly harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Administrative, Organizational and Commercial Operations and Growth\nWe will need to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 31 employees. We may need to expand our managerial, operational, financial and other resources in order to manage our operations and clinical trials, continue our development activities and commercialize MRX34 or other product candidates. Our management and personnel, systems and facilities currently in place are likely not adequate to support this future growth. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure and give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. Our need to effectively execute our business strategy requires that we:\n\u00b7\nmanage our Phase 1 clinical trial, which is being conducted at multiple trial sites, as well as manage any other clinical trials in the future;\n\u00b7\nmanage our internal development efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to licensors, contractors, government agencies, any future collaborators and other third parties;\n\u00b7\ncontinue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; and\n\u00b7\nidentify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees.\nIf we are unable to expand our managerial, operational, financial and other resources to the extent required to manage our development and commercialization activities, our business will be materially adversely affected.\nWe face substantial competition and our competitors may discover, develop or commercialize products faster or more successfully than us.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions worldwide with respect to MRX34 and other product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing technologies and drug products that are more effective or less costly than MRX34 or any other product candidates that we are currently developing or that we may develop, which could render our product candidates obsolete and noncompetitive.\nThere are a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of product candidates for the treatment of solid tumors. The most common treatments for solid tumors are various chemotherapeutic agents, radiation therapy and certain targeted therapies, including monoclonal antibodies such as Avastin\u00ae, Erbitux\u00ae, Herceptin\u00ae and Vectibix\u00ae. Small molecules, such as Nexavar, Sutent\u00ae and Tarceva\u00ae, are also indicated for the treatment of solid tumors.\nIn addition to the competition we face from alternative therapies for the diseases we intend to target with our product candidates, we are also aware of several companies that are also working specifically to develop microRNA therapeutics, including miRagen Therapeutics, Inc., Regulus Therapeutics, Inc. and Santaris Pharma A/S (now Roche). Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products. For example, if MRX34 is approved, it may be priced at a significant premium over other competitive products. This may make it difficult for MRX34 or any other future products to compete with these products.\nIf our competitors obtain marketing approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for their product candidates more rapidly than us, it could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nMany of our competitors have materially greater name recognition and financial, manufacturing, marketing, research and drug development resources than we do. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive expertise in preclinical, nonclinical and clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. These organizations may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors. Failure of MRX34 or other product candidates to effectively compete against established treatment options or in the future with new products currently in development would harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management.\nFrom time to time, we may consider strategic transactions, such as acquisitions of companies, asset purchases, and out-licensing or in-licensing of products, product candidates or technologies. Additional potential transactions that we may consider include a variety of different business arrangements, including spin-offs, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and investments. Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near- and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. For example, these transactions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u00b7\nexposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u00b7\ndisruption of our business and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention in order to develop acquired products, product candidates or technologies;\n\u00b7\nincurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay for acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nhigher-than-expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u00b7\nwrite-downs of assets or goodwill or impairment charges;\n\u00b7\nincreased amortization expenses;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u00b7\nimpairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and\n\u00b7\ninability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses.\nAccordingly, although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, any transactions that we do complete may be subject to the foregoing or other risks, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of our President and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Lammers, M.D., M.Sc., and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and scientific and clinical personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. Our industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management and scientific personnel in recent years. If we are not able to attract, retain and motivate necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff. The loss of service of any of our management and key scientific staff could harm our business, particularly our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Lammers. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively attract and recruit additional qualified personnel. If we are not able to retain our management, particularly our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Lammers, and to attract, on acceptable terms, additional qualified personnel necessary for the continued development of our business, we may not be able to sustain our operations or grow. Although we have executed employment agreements with each member of our current executive management team, including Dr. Lammers, we may not be able to retain their services as expected.\nIn addition, we have scientific and clinical advisors who assist us in formulating our product development and clinical strategies. These advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us, or may have arrangements with other companies to assist in the development of products that may compete with ours.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for any of our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, including the confidential medical information of clinical trial participants, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates: (i) FDA regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA; (ii) manufacturing standards; (iii) federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; or (iv) laws that require the true, complete and accurate information or data. Specifically, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nRequirements associated with being a public company have increased and will continue to increase our costs significantly, as well as divert significant company resources and management attention.\nPrior to our IPO, we were not subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, or the other rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, or any securities exchange relating to public companies. We are working with our legal, independent accounting and financial advisors to identify those areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems to manage our growth and our obligations as a public company. These areas include corporate governance, corporate control, disclosure controls and procedures and financial reporting and accounting systems. We have made, and will continue to make, changes in these and other areas. However, the expenses that will be required in order to operate as a public company are, and could continue to be, material, particularly after we cease to be an \u201cemerging\ngrowth company.\u201d Compliance with the various reporting and other requirements applicable to public companies will also require considerable time and attention of management. In addition, the changes we have made and make may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis.\nHowever, for as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d Because the JOBS Act has only recently been enacted, it is not yet clear whether investors will accept the more limited disclosure requirements that we may be entitled to follow while we are an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d If they do not, we may end up electing to comply with disclosure requirements as if we were not an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d in which case we would incur the greater expenses associated with such disclosure requirements.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years after the completion of our IPO, although if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any September 30 before that time or if we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as of the end of that fiscal year, or if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d immediately.\nIn addition, being a public company could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nIf we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may be subject to sanctions by regulatory authorities.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and, beginning with our annual report for fiscal year 2016, provide a management report on the internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We will be evaluating our internal controls systems to allow management to report on, and eventually allow our independent auditors to attest to, our internal controls. We will be performing the system and process evaluation and testing (and any necessary remediation) required to comply with the management certification and eventual auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The aforementioned auditor attestation requirements will not apply to us until we are not an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nTo date, we have never conducted a review of our internal controls for the purpose of providing the reports required by these rules. We cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations. If we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, or NASDAQ. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results or investors\u2019 confidence in us and could cause our stock price to fall. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, NASDAQ or other regulatory authorities, which would entail expenditure of additional financial and management resources and could materially adversely affect our stock price. Inferior internal controls could also cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have incurred substantial losses during our history and do not expect to become profitable in 2015 and may never achieve profitability. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. We may be unable to use these losses to offset income before such unused losses expire. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be further limited. We believe that we have experienced at least one ownership change in the past. We may also experience additional ownership changes as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, including as a result of our IPO. Accordingly, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize any or a material portion of our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes.\nIf we seek and obtain approval to commercialize MRX34 outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf MRX34 is approved for commercialization outside the United States, we will likely enter into agreements with third parties to market MRX34 outside the United States. We expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into these international business relationships, including:\n\u00b7\ndifferent regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\ndiffering U.S. and foreign drug import and export rules;\n\u00b7\nreduced protection for our intellectual property rights in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nexistence of third party intellectual property rights of potential relevance to our business;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\ndifferent reimbursement systems;\n\u00b7\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad or with U.S. regulations that would apply to activities in such foreign jurisdictions, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u00b7\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u00b7\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u00b7\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u00b7\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u00b7\npotential liability resulting from development work conducted by these distributors; and\n\u00b7\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters.\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nNatural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our enterprise financial systems or manufacturing resource planning and enterprise quality systems, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, certain integral parties in our supply chain are geographically concentrated and operating from single sites, increasing their vulnerability to natural disasters or other sudden, unforeseen and severe adverse events. Although we believe there to be sufficient alternative suppliers in other geographic locations, if such an event were to affect such existing parties in our supply chain, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient patent protection for our technology and product candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates may be adversely affected.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our technologies.\nIn particular, our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our product candidates. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. To protect our proprietary position, we file patent applications in the United States and in limited jurisdictions abroad related to our product candidates and compounds in development that may become our product candidates. The patent application and approval process is expensive and time-consuming. We may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. We may also fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development before it is too late to obtain patent protection.\nThe strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. This uncertainty includes changes to the patent laws through either legislative action to change statutory patent law or court action that may reinterpret existing law in ways affecting the scope or validity of issued patents. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in foreign countries in which we pursue protection with claims that cover our product candidates. There is no assurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Even if patents have issued, or do successfully issue, from patent applications that we own or license, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. For example, patents granted by the European Patent Office, or EPO, may be challenged, also known as opposed, by any person within nine months from the publication of their grant. In May 2015, two separate and unidentified parties filed submissions before the EPO opposing a granted European patent related to MRX34, EP2302055 (the \u2019055 Patent), in-licensed to us from Asuragen. We have reviewed these submissions and have submitted our response. We are currently awaiting a response from the EPO. All of the claims of the \u2019055 Patent remain valid and in force during the opposition proceedings. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the opposition proceedings, for example whether the\npatent will be maintained, limited in scope or whether the grant may be revoked. If the \u2019055 Patent is ultimately narrowed in scope or revoked during the opposition proceedings, the patent protection afforded by the \u2019055 Patent, and the extent of our exclusivity with respect to commercialization of MRX-34 in Europe could be materially impaired. Even if they are unchallenged, our patents may not adequately protect our product candidates, provide any competitive advantage or prevent others from designing around our claims. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold, in-license or pursue with respect to our product candidates is threatened or insufficient, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop or undermine our ability to commercialize our product candidates and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCurrently, our patent portfolio includes over 10 issued U.S. patents and over 42 pending U.S. and ex-U.S. patent applications that we own, co-own, or have in-licensed from third parties, primarily focused on various aspects of microRNA therapeutics, including various microRNA mimics, and methods of use as microRNA related therapies. Within our patent portfolio, we are the sole owner of multiple U.S. and foreign patent applications related to microRNA therapies, including chemically modified versions of miR-34 not currently used in MRX34 (U.S. Patent No. 8,586,727) and other microRNAs mimics that are possible candidates for future product development as microRNA therapeutics. Further, our patent portfolio includes U.S. 7,960,359 and U.S. 8,563,708, both of which are related to miR-34 and are in-licensed from Asuragen. Specifically, U.S. 7,960,359 is related to use of a miR-34a mimic, for example MRX34, for reducing cell viability of human lung cancer cells, human cancerous T cells, human prostate cancer cells or human skin cancer cells. This patent is expected to expire in 2025. We also are the exclusive licensee with respect to MRX34 of US 9,006,206, which relates to use of miR-34 to treat a cancer associated with p53, and EP2126078, which relates to treatment of certain cancers that are also p53 negative. Both US 9,006,206 and EP 2126078 are co-owned by Rosetta Genomics and Yeda Research & Development. See \u201cBusiness-Intellectual Property-Our Patent Portfolio\u201d for a more detailed description of the patents we own or license covering our product candidates.\nIf the patent applications we hold or have in-licensed with respect to our programs or product candidates fail to issue, if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, if we abandon or allow owned or in-licensed patents or patent applications that we are responsible for prosecuting to lapse, or if our owned and in-licensed patents and patent applications fail to provide meaningful exclusivity for our product candidates, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop product candidates, and threaten our ability to commercialize future products. We have multiple pending patent applications relating to our product candidates. We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue, the breadth of the claims of any such patent, should it issue, or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and/or unenforceable, will be interpreted narrowly or will be threatened by third parties. Any successful opposition to these patents or any other patents owned by or licensed to us could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any product candidates that we may develop.\nAlmost all of our patents and patent applications are entitled to effective filing dates prior to March 16, 2013. For U.S. patent applications in which patent claims are entitled to a priority date before March 16, 2013, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third party, for example a competitor, or instituted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by those patent claims. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our participation in an interference proceeding may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management.\nFurther, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials or achieving regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market any of our product candidates under patent protection, if approved, would be reduced. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates. Furthermore, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third party or instituted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. In addition, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if we obtain patents that cover the manufacture, use and/or sale of\nour product candidates and such patents are not successfully challenged by any third parties, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition, including from generic medications.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to product components and processes for our development pipeline through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nPresently we have rights to certain intellectual property through licenses from third parties and under patents that we own or co-own, related to a subset of the known microRNA targets. Because our programs may involve a range of microRNA targets and specific formulations of microRNA mimics directed to such targets, including targets and formulations that may require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of our business will likely depend in part on our ability to acquire, in-license or otherwise gain the right to use these proprietary rights. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any necessary or desirable third-party intellectual property rights on reasonable terms, or at all. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive now or in the future. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights, including rights related to our lead product candidate, our business, financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our technology could be materially adversely affected and our business would be harmed.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that may not be patentable or that we elect not to patent, processes for which patents may be difficult to obtain or enforce, and any other elements of our product candidates\u2019 discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary data and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and collaborators, and any other third parties that have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology, for example, third parties involved in our clinical trials. Although we expect all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, and we cannot be certain that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. For example, the FDA, as part of its Transparency Initiative, is currently considering whether to make additional information publicly available on a routine basis, including information that we may consider to be trade secrets or other proprietary information, and it is not clear at the present time how the FDA\u2019s disclosure policies may change in the future, if at all.\nWe also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Moreover, if any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position.\nFurther, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the\nintellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, we will not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIssued patents covering our product candidates could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or the USPTO.\nIf we or one of our licensing partners initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering the manufacture, use or sale, or other aspects of one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace, and there are numerous grounds upon which a third party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include ex parte re-examination, inter partes review, post grant review and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we, our patent counsel and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates. Similarly, the outcome following administrative review of a patent that we own or license, such as via a reexamination or opposition proceeding before the USPTO or a foreign body, is unpredictable. If a third party were to prevail, we could lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIf we are sued for infringing the patent rights or misappropriating the trade secrets of third parties, such litigation could be costly and time consuming and could prevent or delay us from developing or commercializing our product candidates.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technology without infringing the patent rights of third parties. Numerous third-party U.S. and non-U.S. issued patents and pending applications exist in the area of microRNA. We are aware of certain U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications owned by our competitors or other third parties that cover certain miR-34 mimics and therapeutic uses thereof. We are currently monitoring these patents and patent applications. We have and we may in the future pursue available proceedings in the U.S. and foreign patent offices to challenge the validity of these patents and patent applications. In addition, or alternatively, we may consider whether to seek to negotiate a license of rights to technology covered by one or more of such patents and patent applications. If any patents or patent applications cover our product candidates or technologies, we may not be free to manufacture or market our product candidates, including MRX34, as planned, absent such a license, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIt is also possible that we have failed to identify relevant third-party patents or applications. For example, applications filed before November 29, 2000 and certain applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until patents issue. Moreover, it is difficult for industry participants, including us, to identify all third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our product candidates and technologies because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. We may fail to identify relevant patents or patent applications or may identify pending patent applications of potential interest but incorrectly predict the likelihood that such patent applications may issue with claims of relevance to our technology. In addition, we may be unaware of one or more issued patents that would be infringed by the manufacture, sale or use of a current or future product candidate, or we may incorrectly conclude that a third-party patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by our activities. Additionally, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our technologies, our products or the use of our products.\nThere is a substantial amount of intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may become party to, or threatened with, litigation or other adversarial proceedings regarding patent rights with respect to our technology or products candidates, including interferences, oppositions and inter partes review proceedings before the USPTO and corresponding foreign patent offices. We also monitor patent prosecution activities and pending applications of competitors and potential competitors in our field in order to identify third party patent rights that could pose a potential threat to our freedom to operate in the market with respect to our product candidates, once commercialized. We are currently pursuing and may in the future pursue available administrative proceedings in the U.S. or foreign patent offices to challenge third party patent rights that could adversely impact our ability to commercialize one or more of our product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our current or future product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties, who may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future patent rights. Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates and third parties could allege that our technology infringes such claims. Further, because patent applications can take many years to issue, third parties may have currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe, or which such third parties claim are infringed by the use of our technologies. The outcome of patent litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have produced a significant number of patents, and it may not always be clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product candidates, products or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving that a patent is invalid is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s patent rights, including any patent rights related to miR-34, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing or commercializing the infringing product candidate or product. Alternatively, we may be required to obtain a license from such third party in order to use the infringing technology and continue developing, manufacturing or marketing the infringing product candidate. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nParties making claims against us for infringement of their patent rights may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we could be required to redesign our infringing products or obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and commercializing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. It may be impossible to redesign our products and technology, or it may require substantial time and monetary expenditure, which could force us to cease commercialization of one or more of our product candidates, including MRX34, or some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. In addition, in any such proceeding, we may be required to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees in the event we are found liable for willful infringement.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits or administrative proceedings to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe or we may believe that they infringe patents that we own or license. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party in such infringement proceeding from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly, and could put any of our patent applications at risk of not yielding an issued patent. Litigation is uncertain, and we cannot predict whether we would be successful in any such litigation.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO or any foreign patent authority may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms, if any license is offered at all. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.\nWe may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our trade secrets or confidential information, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nLegal actions to enforce patent rights or other intellectual property rights that we own or license can be expensive and may involve the diversion of significant management time. In addition, these legal actions could be unsuccessful and could also result in the invalidation of our patents or a finding that they are unenforceable. Moreover, third parties may be able to successfully design around our patents using pre-existing technology, by developing new technology or by using similar technology that is outside the scope of our patents. We may or may not choose to pursue litigation against those that have infringed on our patents, or used them without authorization, due to the associated expense and time commitment of monitoring these activities. If we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our patent rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. For example, unlike other countries, China has a heightened requirement for patentability, and specifically requires a detailed description of medical uses of a claimed therapeutic. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions.\nAs part of ordinary course prosecution and maintenance activities, we determine whether to seek patent protection outside the United States and in which countries. This also applies to patents we have acquired or in-licensed from third parties. In some cases, this means that we, or our predecessors in interest or licensors of patents within our portfolio, have sought patent protection in a limited number of countries for patents covering our product candidates, including for patents providing coverage for MRX34. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not pursued and obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but where enforcement is not as strong as in the United\nStates. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and, even in jurisdictions where we have or are able to obtain issued patents, our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. In addition, certain countries in Europe and certain developing countries, including India and China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we may have limited remedies if our patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license to our patents to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities.\nAccordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license. Moreover, patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries.\nThe patent protection and patent prosecution for some of our product candidates may be dependent on our third party licensors.\nWhile we normally seek to obtain the right to control the filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of the patents and patent applications that we in-license relating to our product candidates, there may be times when such activities for patents that relate to our product candidates are controlled by our licensors. For example, we do not have the first right to prosecute, maintain, defend, or enforce the patent rights licensed to us relating to the SMARTICLES technology under our agreement with Marina Biotech, Inc., or Marina. Although we may retain the right to consult on such filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense, and enforcement activities, our overall ability to influence such activities is limited. Moreover, the patent rights we have in-licensed from Marina may be put at risk in litigation or administrative proceedings unrelated to our product candidates. Further, while we seek to have rights to take action to defend our in-licensed patents and patent applications from third-party challenges in the event that our licensors determine not to, we may not be aware of any such potential threats to the intellectual property rights we in-license, or we may be unsuccessful in protecting such intellectual property rights if we respond to any such challenges by third parties.\nIf these licensors or any of our future licensors fail to appropriately file, prosecute, maintain, defend or enforce our in-licensed patents and patent applications covering any of our product candidates, our ability to develop and commercialize those product candidates may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products.\nIf we breach any of the agreements under which we license patent rights to use, develop and commercialize our product candidates or our technologies from third parties or, in certain cases, we fail to meet certain development deadlines, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to a number of license agreements under which we are granted rights to intellectual property that are important to our business and we expect that we may need to enter into additional license agreements in the future. These include our exclusive cross-license agreement with Asuragen, our exclusive licenses from Yale University, or Yale, Marina, the University of Zurich, and Rosetta Genomics.\nOur existing license agreements, except our cross-license agreement with Asuragen, generally impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose on us, various development, regulatory and/or commercial diligence obligations, and financial obligations, such as payment of milestones and/or royalties. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we may not be able to market products covered by the license. Our business could suffer, for example, if any current or future licenses terminate, if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license, if the licensed patents or other rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable, or if we are unable to enter into necessary licenses on acceptable terms. See \u201cBusiness-Key Partnerships and Licenses\u201d for a description of our license agreements, which sets forth the material terms and obligations, including a description of the termination provisions, under our agreements with Asuragen, Yale, Marina, the University of Zurich and Rosetta Genomics.\nWe license the technology related to SMARTICLES from Marina. Our license with Marina imposes various development, regulatory, commercial diligence, financial and other obligations. If we fail to comply with our obligations under the agreement with Marina, or otherwise materially breach the agreement with Marina, and fail to remedy such failure or cure such breach, Marina may have the right to terminate the license. The loss of the license from Marina would affect a portion of the patent portfolio for MRX34, which would adversely affect our ability to proceed with any development or potential commercialization of MRX34, and could subject us to claims of patent infringement by Marina if MRX34 is covered by the affected patents.\nAs we have done previously, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates, and we cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist that might be enforced against our current product candidates or future products in the absence of such a license. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license replacement technology. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected product candidates, which could materially harm our business and the third parties owning such intellectual property rights could seek either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation.\nLicensing of intellectual property is of critical importance to our business and involves complex legal, business and scientific issues. Disputes may arise between us and our licensors regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement, including:\n\u00b7\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u00b7\nwhether and the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u00b7\nour right to sublicense patent and other rights to third parties under collaborative development relationships;\n\u00b7\nour diligence obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to our development and commercialization of our product candidates, and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations; and\n\u00b7\nthe ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners.\nIf disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed arise, we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including seeking to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patents licensed to us. However, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost or at all. Generally, the loss of any one of our current licenses, or any other license we may acquire in the future, could prevent or\nimpair our ability to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates and thus materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, provide a barrier to entry against our competitors or potential competitors, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. Moreover, if a third party has intellectual property rights that cover the practice of our technology, we may not be able to fully exercise or extract value from our intellectual property rights. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u00b7\nothers may be able to make compounds that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or license;\n\u00b7\nwe or our licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by an issued patent or pending patent application that we own or license;\n\u00b7\nwe or our licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering an invention;\n\u00b7\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\npending patent applications that we own or license may not lead to issued patents;\n\u00b7\nissued patents that we own or license may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u00b7\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u00b7\nwe may not develop or in-license additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u00b7\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe were previously involved in discussions with Yale regarding the inventorship and ownership of certain patents and patent applications licensed to us by Asuragen. An independent third party expert was engaged to determine the inventorship and the ownership of patents and patent applications potentially subject to Yale and Asuragen co-ownership. This determination confirmed Asuragen\u2019s sole ownership of the patents and patent applications where co-ownership had been under consideration and resulted in a determination that Yale should be removed as a co-owner of one of the pending patent applications, an action we are currently undertaking.\nAlthough we seek to protect our ownership of our patents and other intellectual property by ensuring that our agreements with our employees and certain collaborators and other third parties with whom we do business include provisions requiring, for instance, such parties to assign rights in inventions to us, we may be subject to claims that former or current employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents, in-licensed patents or other intellectual property. In some situations, our confidentiality agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants or advisors have previous employment or consulting\nrelationships, and further, many of our consultants are currently retained by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors, and may be subject to conflicting obligations to these third parties. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use any intellectual property owned by third parties in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the ownership of rights in any related or resulting know-how and inventions, arising, for example, from such conflicting obligations of consultants, employees or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nObtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent prosecution process. Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or patent applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we employ reputable law firms and other professionals and rely on such third parties to effect payment of these fees with respect to the USPTO and non-U.S. patent agencies with respect to the patents and patent applications we own, and we rely upon our licensors to effect payment of these fees with respect to the patents and patent applications that we in-license. Even if we do not control prosecution and maintenance of our in-licensed patents, we may be responsible for reimbursing our licensors for some or all of the costs associated with such activities. If we fail to make timely payment to our licensors for such fees, our licensors may have the right to terminate the affected license, in which event we would not be able to market products covered by the license. We also employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply with the various documentary and other procedural requirements with respect to the patents and patent applications that we own. In some cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products, and recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nAs is the case with other biotechnology companies, our success is heavily dependent on patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. Some of our patent claims may be affected by the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics. In Myriad, the Supreme Court held that unmodified isolated fragments of genomic sequences, such as the DNA constituting the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, are not eligible for patent protection because they constitute a product of nature. The exact boundaries of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision remain unclear as the Supreme Court did not address other types of nucleic acids, such as isolated microRNAs. Nevertheless, our patent portfolio contains claims of various types and scope, including chemically modified mimics, such as in MRX34, as well as methods of medical treatment. In our view, the presence of varying claims in our patent portfolio significantly\nreduces, but does not eliminate, our exposure to potential validity challenges under Myriad or future judicial decisions. However, it is not yet clear what, if any, impact this recent Supreme Court decision or future decisions will have on the operation of our business.\nFor our U.S. patent applications containing a claim not entitled to priority before March 16, 2013, there is a greater level of uncertainty in the patent law. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO has promulgated regulations and developed procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, did not come into effect until March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not yet clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nAn important change introduced by the Leahy-Smith Act is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after that date but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Furthermore, our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents depends on whether the differences between our technology and the prior art allow our technology to be patentable over the prior art. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to either (i) file any patent application related to our product candidates or (ii) invent any of the inventions claimed in our patents or patent applications.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the Leahy-Smith Act are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal court necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees or consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information or trade secrets of third parties or that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of former or other employers.\nMany of our employees, independent contractors and consultants, including our senior management, have been previously employed or retained by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of third parties in their work for us, and do not perform work for us that is in conflict with their obligations to another employer or any other entity, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise improperly used or disclosed confidential information, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a former employer or other third parties. We may also be subject to claims that an employee, advisor, consultant, or independent contractor performed work for us that conflicts with that person\u2019s obligations to a third party, such as an employer, and thus, that the third party has an ownership interest in the intellectual property arising out of work performed for us. We are not aware of any threatened or pending claims related to these matters, but in the future litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable personnel or intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an\noutcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property disputes could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and/or management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we do not obtain patent term extension in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act and in foreign countries under similar legislation, thereby potentially extending the term of our marketing exclusivity for our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, if any, one of the U.S. patents covering each of such approved product(s) or the use thereof may be eligible for up to five years of patent term restoration under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows a maximum of one patent to be extended per FDA approved product. Patent term extension also may be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval of our product candidates. Nevertheless, we may not be granted patent term extension either in the United States or in any foreign country because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the term of extension, as well as the scope of patent protection during any such extension, afforded by the governmental authority could be less than we request. In addition, if a patent we wish to extend is owned by another party and licensed to us, we may need to obtain approval and cooperation from our licensor to request the extension.\nIf we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration, or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for a product candidate, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense and subject us to penalties if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements.\nOnce regulatory approval has been granted, the approved product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review by the FDA and/or non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Any regulatory approval that we receive for our product candidates may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post- marketing follow-up studies to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. In addition, if the FDA and/or non-U.S. regulatory authorities approve any of our product candidates, we will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements by the FDA and other regulatory authorities with regard to the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, sampling, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for our products. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with cGMP regulations, which include requirements related to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Further, regulatory authorities must approve these manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture our products, and these facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities\nfor compliance with cGMP regulations. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, and quality control. We will also be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved label. As such, we may not promote our products for indications or uses for which they do not have FDA approval.\nIf we, any current or future collaborator or a regulatory authority discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions on that product, such collaborator, the manufacturer or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with regulatory requirements of the FDA and/or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u00b7\nwarning letters;\n\u00b7\ncivil or criminal penalties;\n\u00b7\ninjunctions;\n\u00b7\nsuspension of or withdrawal of regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\ntotal or partial suspension of any ongoing clinical trials or of production;\n\u00b7\nvoluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;\n\u00b7\nrefusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products or supplements to approved applications filed by us;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u00b7\nseizure or detention of our products or import bans.\nThe regulatory requirements and policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted for which we may also be required to comply. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or in other countries. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of our product candidates. In addition, if we or any current or future collaborator are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we or such collaborator, as applicable, will not be permitted to market our future products and our business will suffer.\nThe availability of adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement for newly approved products is uncertain, and failure to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors could impede our ability to market any future products we may develop and could limit our ability to generate revenue.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved medical products. The commercial success of our future products in both domestic and international markets depends on whether such third-party coverage and reimbursement are available for our future products. Governmental payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to manage their healthcare expenditures and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs and biologics and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate reimbursement for our future products. These payors may not view our future products as\ncost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available to our customers, may be limited to certain indications or may not be sufficient to allow our future products to be marketed on a competitive basis. Third-party payors are exerting increasing influence on decisions regarding the use of, and coverage and reimbursement levels for, particular treatments. Cost-control initiatives could cause us to decrease the price we might establish for our products candidates, which could result in lower than anticipated product revenues. If we decrease the prices for our product candidates because of competitive pressures or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage or reimbursement, our prospects for revenue and profitability will suffer.\nIf we fail to comply or are found to have failed to comply with FDA and other regulations related to the promotion of our products for unapproved uses, we could be subject to criminal penalties, substantial fines or other sanctions and damage awards.\nThe regulations relating to the promotion of products for unapproved uses are complex and subject to substantial interpretation by the FDA and other government agencies. If we receive marketing approval for MRX34 or other product candidates, we will be restricted from promoting the products for uses outside of the approved labeling. However, physicians may nevertheless prescribe products to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. We intend to implement compliance and training programs designed to ensure that our sales and marketing practices comply with applicable regulations. Notwithstanding these programs, the FDA or other government agencies may allege or find that our practices constitute prohibited promotion of our products for unapproved uses. We also cannot be sure that our employees will comply with company policies and applicable regulations regarding the promotion of products for unapproved uses.\nOver the past several years, a significant number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been the target of inquiries and investigations by various federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales practices, including the Department of Justice and various U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission and various state Attorneys General offices. These investigations have included claims asserting alleged violations of various federal and state laws and regulations, including antitrust laws, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the False Claims Act, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, anti-kickback laws, and other alleged violations in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses, pricing and reimbursement from government programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Many of these investigations originate as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, commonly referred to as \u201cwhistleblower suits,\u201d under the False Claims Act, often brought by current or former employees. Under the False Claims Act, any individual can bring a claim on behalf of the government alleging that a person or entity has presented a false claim, or caused a false claim to be submitted, to the government for payment. In a qui tam suit, the government must decide whether to intervene and prosecute the case. If it declines, the individual may pursue the case alone. The person bringing a qui tam suit is entitled to a share of any recovery or settlement, up to a certain cap; the relator\u2019s share depends on the extent of the relator\u2019s involvement in the case and whether the government intervenes.\nIf the FDA or any other governmental agency initiates an enforcement action against us or if we are the subject of a qui tam suit and it is determined that we violated prohibitions relating to the promotion of products for unapproved uses, we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal fines or damage awards and other sanctions such as consent decrees and corporate integrity agreements pursuant to which our activities would be subject to ongoing scrutiny and monitoring to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any such fines, awards or other sanctions would have an adverse effect on our revenue, business, financial prospects and reputation.\nIf approved, MRX34 or any future products may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that we are required to report to regulatory agencies, and if we fail to do so we could be subject to sanctions that would materially harm our business.\nIf we are successful in commercializing MRX34 or any other products, FDA and foreign regulatory agency regulations require that we report certain information about adverse medical events if those products may have caused or contributed to those adverse events. The timing of our obligation to report would be triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events we become aware of within the\nprescribed timeframe. We may also fail to appreciate that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA or a foreign regulatory agency could take action, including criminal prosecution, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, seizure of our products or delay in approval of future products. Through the first 32 months of our Phase 1 clinical trial, most of the 122 patients treated with MRX34 experienced at least one adverse event, with fever, chills, back pain, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, anorexia, dyspnea, fatigue, headache, cough, insomnia, dysgeusia, tachycardia, anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevation of liver enzymes, hyperglycemia, and hyponatremia being the most commonly reported adverse events. Two treatment-related deaths occurred during the study. Among the 47 patients in the BIW dosing cohorts, the serious adverse events determined to be related to MRX34 treatment occurring in more than one patient were fever, fatigue, dehydration and elevation of liver enzymes, each of which occurred in two patients. For the 75 patients in the QD \u00d7 5 dosing cohort, capillary leak syndrome, delirium or altered mental status, and bleeding in silent or asymptomatic HCC brain metastasis, each of which occurred in two patients, and elevation of liver enzymes, fever, and thrombocytopenia, which occurred in four patients. These adverse events associated with MRX34 are generally manageable or preventable with standard interventions or tests used by oncologists, such as administering other medications that prevent or reduce side effects, temporary slowing of infusions, delaying or stopping dosing, or using magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, to detect silent brain metastases. Of the 42 patients with primary liver cancer treated with escalating doses of MRX34, one patient in 70 mg/ m2 dose cohort in BIW schedule achieved confirmed partial response. Of the two acral melanoma patients enrolled in the study, one patient enrolled in the 110 mg/ m2 dose cohort on the QD \u00d7 5 schedule achieved a confirmed partial response. Of the two metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients enrolled in the study, one patient enrolled in the 110 mg/ m2 dose cohort on the QD \u00d7 5 schedule achieved a confirmed partial response. See \u201cBusiness-MRX34: Our Lead Product Candidate\u201d for a more detailed description of the adverse events experienced during the course of the MRX34 clinical development program.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from marketing our product candidates internationally.\nWe may seek a distribution and marketing collaborator for MRX34 or other product candidates. In order to market our product candidates in the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), and many other foreign jurisdictions, we or any such collaborator must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations:\n\u00b7\nThe Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.\n\u00b7\nNational MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.\nUnder these two procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.\nWe have had limited interactions with foreign regulatory authorities, and the approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional clinical testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one or more foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We or may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and even if we file, we may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our product candidates in any market.\nHealthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent our product candidates\u2019 commercial success.\nIn the United States, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future revenues and profitability and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers. Federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and, at times, enact legislation that results in significant changes to the healthcare system, some of which are intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services. For example, in March 2010, the President signed one of the most significant healthcare reform measures in decades, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act. It contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse measures, all of which will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs. The Affordable Care Act, among other things:\n\u00b7\nimposes a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell \u201cbranded prescription drugs\u201d;\n\u00b7\nincreases the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand-name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%;\n\u00b7\naddresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;\n\u00b7\nrequires collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u00b7\nrequires manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and\n\u00b7\nmandates a further shift in the burden of Medicaid payments to the states.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nThere likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at containing or lowering the cost of health care. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future or their full impact. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of health care may adversely affect:\n\u00b7\nour ability to set a price we believe is fair for our products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; and\n\u00b7\nthe availability of capital.\nIn light of widely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain drug products, regulatory authorities, members of Congress, the Governmental Accounting Office, medical professionals and the general public have raised concerns about potential drug safety issues. These events have resulted in the withdrawal of drug products, revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the drug products and establishment of risk management programs that may, for instance, restrict distribution of drug products. The increased attention to drug safety issues may result in a more cautious approach by the FDA to clinical trials and the drug approval process. Data from clinical trials may receive greater scrutiny with respect to safety, which may make the FDA or other regulatory authorities more likely to terminate clinical trials before completion, or require longer or additional clinical trials that may result in substantial additional expense and a delay or failure in obtaining approval or approval for a more limited indication than originally sought. In, addition, because of the serious public health risks of high profile adverse safety events with certain products, the FDA may require, as a condition of approval, costly risk management programs which may include safety surveillance, restricted distribution and use, patient education, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, preapproval of promotional materials and restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nEven though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. We could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation:\n\u00b7\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;\n\u00b7\nthe federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false claims, or knowingly using false statements, to obtain payment from the federal government, and which may apply to entities that provide coding and billing advice to customers;\n\u00b7\nfederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the government information related to payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to the government ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members and payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d to such physician owners (manufacturers are required to submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year);\n\u00b7\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; and\n\u00b7\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud and abuse laws may prove costly.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the initial public offering price.\nThe trading price of our common stock could be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include those discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this document and others such as:\n\u00b7\nability to commercialize or obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, or delays in commercializing or obtaining regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nresults from, or any delays in, preclinical or nonclinical testing or clinical trial programs relating to our product candidates, including the Phase 1 clinical trial for MRX34;\n\u00b7\nany need to suspend or discontinue clinical trials due to side effects or other safety risks, or any need to conduct studies on the long-term effects associated with the use of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nmanufacturing issues related to our product candidates for clinical trials or future products for commercialization;\n\u00b7\ncommercial success and market acceptance of our product candidates following regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nundesirable side effects caused by product candidates after they have entered the market;\n\u00b7\nability to discover, develop and commercialize additional product candidates;\n\u00b7\nannouncements relating to collaborations that we may enter into with respect to the development or commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nannouncements relating to the receipt, modification or termination of government contracts or grants;\n\u00b7\nsuccess of our competitors in discovering, developing or commercializing products;\n\u00b7\nstrategic transactions undertaken by us;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nproduct liability claims related to our clinical trials or product candidates;\n\u00b7\nprevailing economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nbusiness disruptions caused by earthquakes or other natural disasters;\n\u00b7\ndisputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\nFDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory actions affecting us or our industry;\n\u00b7\nhealthcare reform measures in the United States;\n\u00b7\nsales of our common stock by our officers, directors or significant stockholders;\n\u00b7\nfuture sales or issuances of equity or debt securities by us;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in our quarterly operating results; and\n\u00b7\nthe issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations regarding us.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that have been often unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our common stock. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer. If any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the attention of our management would be diverted from the operation of our business.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and are able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nBased on the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of December 31, 2015, our officers and directors, together with holders of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock and their respective affiliates, beneficially own approximately 74.8% of our common stock. Accordingly, these stockholders have significant influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transaction. The interests of these stockholders\nmay not be the same as or may even conflict with your interests. For example, these stockholders could delay or prevent a change of control of our company, even if such a change of control would benefit our other stockholders, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company or our assets and might affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. The significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 102 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are choosing to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nFuture sales of our common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable for our common stock may depress our stock price.\nIf our existing stockholders or holders of our options sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after the lock-up and legal restrictions on resale discussed in this periodic report lapse, the trading price of our common stock could decline. The perception in the market that these sales may occur could also cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Of the 20,830,555 shares of common stock outstanding at March 15, 2016, only the shares of common stock sold by us in the IPO, plus any shares sold upon exercise of the underwriters\u2019 option to purchase additional shares of common stock, are currently freely tradable without restriction, unless held by our affiliates or otherwise subject to the lock-up agreements pertaining to the IPO, in the public market.\nThe lock-up agreements pertaining to the IPO will expire on March 28, 2016. After the lock-up agreements expire, an additional approximately 13,875,593 shares of common stock will be eligible for sale in the public market, subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, with respect to shares held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates. The underwriters may, however, in their sole discretion, permit our officers, directors and other stockholders and the holders of our outstanding options who are subject to the lock-up agreements to sell shares prior to the expiration of the lock-up agreements. Sales of these shares, or perceptions that they will be sold, could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nIn addition, based on the number of shares subject to outstanding awards under our 2008 Long Term Incentive Plan, or 2008 Stock Plan, as of December 31, 2015, and including the initial reserves under our 2015 Equity Incentive Award Plan, or 2015 Plan, and Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding options, outstanding but subject to vesting, or reserved for future issuance under the 2008 Stock Plan, 2015 Plan or ESPP will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted\nby the provisions of various vesting schedules, the lock-up agreements and Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act. We also filed a registration statement permitting certain shares of common stock issued in the future pursuant to the 2008 Plan, 2015 Plan and ESPP to be freely resold by plan participants in the public market, subject to the lock-up agreements, applicable vesting schedules and, for shares held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates, volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The 2015 Plan and ESPP also contain provisions for the annual increase of the number of shares reserved for issuance under such plans, which shares we also intend to register. If the shares we may issue from time to time under the 2008 Stock Plan, 2015 Plan or ESPP are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, by the award recipient in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nCertain holders of approximately 13.9 million shares of our common stock at December 31, 2015 are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act, subject to the lock-up agreements described above. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares purchased by affiliates. Sales of such shares could also cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nAn active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not develop.\nPrior to our IPO in October 2015, there had been no public market for our common stock, and an active public market for our shares may not develop or be sustained. Further, certain of our existing institutional investors, including investors affiliated with certain of our directors, purchased approximately 2.4 million shares of common stock in our IPO and consequently fewer shares may be actively traded in the public market because these stockholders are restricted from selling the shares by restrictions under applicable securities laws and the lock-up agreements entered into in connection with our IPO, which would reduce the liquidity of the market for our common stock. The lack of an active market may impair our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they consider reasonable. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other businesses or technologies or in-license new product candidates using our shares as consideration.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, each of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. Our net loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u00b7\nvariations in the level of expenses related to our product candidates or future development programs;\n\u00b7\nif MRX34 or any other product candidate receives regulatory approval, the level of underlying demand for these product candidates;\n\u00b7\naddition or termination of clinical trials or funding support;\n\u00b7\nreceipt, modification or termination of government contracts or grants, and the timing of payments we receive under these arrangements;\n\u00b7\nour execution of any collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;\n\u00b7\nany intellectual property infringement lawsuit or opposition, interference or cancellation proceeding in which we may become involved; and\n\u00b7\nregulatory developments affecting our product candidates or those of our competitors.\nIf our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn,\ncause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nWe will have broad discretion to determine how to use the net proceeds of our IPO and the concurrent private placement and may not use them effectively.\nOur management has broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from our IPO and the concurrent private placement described in the Prospectus. Because of the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of such proceeds, you may not agree with how we allocate or spend the proceeds from our IPO and the concurrent private placement. We may pursue collaborations or clinical trials that do not result in an increase in the market value of our common shares and that may increase our losses. Our failure to allocate and spend the net proceeds from our IPO and the concurrent private placement effectively would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Until the net proceeds are used, they may be placed in investments that do not produce significant investment returns or that may lose value.\nProvisions of our charter documents or Delaware law could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and could make it more difficult for you to change management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\na classified board of directors so that not all directors are elected at one time;\n\u00b7\na prohibition on stockholder action through written consent;\n\u00b7\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u00b7\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director;\n\u00b7\na requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by the board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer or, in the absence of a chief executive officer, the president;\n\u00b7\nan advance notice requirement for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u00b7\nthe authority of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as our board of directors may determine; and\n\u00b7\na requirement of approval of not less than 662/3% of all outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote to amend any bylaws by stockholder action, or to amend specific provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nIn addition, Delaware law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person who, together with its affiliates, owns or within the last three years has owned 15% or more of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly, Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Furthermore, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will specify that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for most legal actions involving actions brought against us by stockholders. We believe this\nprovision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law by chancellors particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. However, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action.\nProvisions in our charter and other provisions of Delaware law could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur employment agreements with our officers may require us to pay severance benefits to any of those persons who are terminated in connection with a change of control of us, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur officers are parties to employment agreements providing for aggregate cash payments of up to approximately $2.5 million at December 31, 2015 for severance and other benefits in the event of a termination of employment in connection with a change of control of us. The payment of these severance benefits could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, these potential severance payments may discourage or prevent third parties from seeking a business combination with us.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future; therefore, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt financing arrangement may contain terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on our company. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our common stock would likely be negatively impacted. In the event securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, if our operating results fail to meet the forecast of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nChanges in, or interpretations of, accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges or require us to change our compensation policies.\nAccounting methods and policies for biopharmaceutical companies, including policies governing revenue recognition, research and development and related expenses and accounting for stock-based compensation, are subject to further review, interpretation and guidance from relevant accounting authorities, including the SEC. Changes to, or interpretations of, accounting methods or policies may require us to reclassify, restate or otherwise change or revise our financial statements, including those contained in this periodic report.", "PERMNO": 15787, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "SYBX"}
