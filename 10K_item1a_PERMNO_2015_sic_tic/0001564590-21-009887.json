business.\n\u2022\nOur inability to manufacture products in accordance with applicable specifications, performance standards or quality requirements could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to numerous government regulations in addition to FDA requirements, which could increase our costs and affect our operations.\n\u2022\nFailure to comply with privacy, security and breach notification regulations may increase our costs.\n\u2022\nFailure to comply with data protection requirements or privacy laws could increase our costs.\n\u2022\nFDA regulation of laboratory-develop tests and genetic testing could affect demand for our products.\n\u2022\nOur international sales create potential exposure under anti-corruption laws.\nRisks Relating to the Economy, Our Financial Results, Investments, Credit Facilities and Need for Financing\n\u2022\nEconomic volatility and disruption, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, financial performance, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition or those of our customers and suppliers.\n\u2022\nAn impairment of goodwill and intangible assets could reduce our earnings.\n\u2022\nWe have experienced losses in the past and may not be able to maintain profitable operations.\n\u2022\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect our operating results.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\n\u2022\nOur stock price could continue to be volatile.\n\u2022\nFuture sales of our Common Stock by existing stockholders, executive officers or directors could depress the market price of our Common Stock and make it more difficult for us to sell stock in the future.\n\u2022\nBecause we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock, an investor in our Common Stock will benefit only if our Common Stock appreciates in value.\n\u2022\nCertain provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and under Delaware law could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u2022\nWe may face product liability claims for injuries resulting from the use of our products.\n\u2022\nPerformance of our products may affect our revenues, stock price and reputation.\n\u2022\nOur ability to sell products could be adversely affected by competition from new and existing products and services.\n\u2022\nFailure to achieve our financial and strategic objectives could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects.\n\u2022\nIf we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel as necessary, our business could be harmed.\n\u2022\nIf our essential employees who are unable to telework become ill or otherwise incapacitated our operations may be adversely impacted.\n\u2022\nIncreases in demand for our products and services could require use to expend considerable resources or harm our customer relationships if we are unable to meet that demand.\n\u2022\nWe rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of that technology could harm our ability to efficiently operate our business.\n\u2022\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, expose us to liability and harm our reputation and business.\n\u2022\nFederal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nWe may experience fluctuations in our financial results or fail to meet our financial projections.\n\u2022\nWe may require future additional capital.\n\u2022\nTerrorist attacks, natural disasters, public health crises or other catastrophic events outside of our control may adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity offerings.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report and our other SEC filings, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not disclosed or not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Products, Marketing and Sales\nChanges in the Genomics Market May Adversely Affect our Business.\nThe genomics market has been the largest component of our overall molecular business segment for some time and the major driver of this market has been ancestry testing which offers products and services to consumers to provide them with genealogical information. The ancestry market is maturing and sales to this market have declined in recent periods. Our genomics revenues have been reduced, primarily due to a change in promotional strategies and purchasing patterns by our largest customer which serves the consumer ancestry and genetic testing market. This trend in the ancestry testing market is continuing and is expected to adversely affect our revenues and results of operations in future periods.\nIn an effort to increase our molecular revenues, we have devoted increasing time and attention to expanding sales of our genomics products both domestically and internationally, including in the Asia-Pacific and other markets. While we believe these new markets represent large growth opportunities, there is no assurance that we will be successful in capitalizing on these opportunities or that we will be able to increase our international product sales consistent with our expectations. Factors that include, but are not limited to, the market acceptance of our products, available funding, cost containment strategies implemented by customers, increasing competition and regulatory constraints could limit sales of our genomics products into these international markets. To the extent that we are unsuccessful or limited in expanding our business in the Asia-Pacific or other new markets, our revenues and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nDespite the challenges that we face in the ancestry market, we believe there is significant growth opportunity for our genomics products in the area of disease risk management (\u201cDRM\u201d). However, during 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) investigated several telemedicine companies and individuals for allegedly submitting fraudulent insurance claims to Medicare for cancer genetic screening and pharmacogenomics testing. Several of our customers were included in the DOJ investigation. These activities have had a negative impact on our revenues and to the extent such allegedly fraudulent insurance billing practices continue, our future genomic revenues could be adversely affected.\nOur Future Success Depends Upon Market Acceptance of Our Existing and Future Products and Service Offerings.\nWe believe successful new product and service introductions provide a significant competitive advantage because customers make an investment of time in selecting and learning to use a new product or service and are reluctant to switch thereafter. Our future success will depend, in part, on the market acceptance, and the timing of such acceptance, of new products such as our in-home antigen pan-SARS-coronavirus self-test (\u201cCoronavirus Self-Test\u201d), laboratory-based oral fluid SARS-CoV-2 antibody test (\u201cCoronavirus Antibody Test\u201d), OraQuick\u00ae HIV Self-Test, OraQuick\u00ae Ebola test and OMNIgene\u00ae \u2022 GUT product offerings, and other new products or technologies that may be developed or acquired. In addition, our future revenues will depend on market acceptance of new uses for our saliva collection products, including for COVID-19 testing, and our new service offerings, such as the microbiome laboratory testing and analytical services we provide through Diversigen. To commercially market new uses of our products and to achieve market acceptance, we will likely be required to undertake clinical studies to validate the new uses for our products and substantial marketing efforts and spend significant funds to complete product development and clinical studies and inform potential customers and the public of the existence and perceived benefits of these products and services. In addition, governmental funding may be needed to help complete development, obtain required regulatory approvals, clearances or EUAs and create market acceptance and expand the use of these products and services.\nThere may be limited evidence on which to evaluate the market reaction to products and services that may be developed and our marketing efforts for new products and services or products with new uses may not be successful. The market for microbiome products and services is in its early stages and its future development and acceptance by our customers is uncertain. It is also possible that governmental funding may be limited for new products, such as our Coronavirus Self-Test and Coronavirus Antibody Test or the new sample collection and stabilization products being commercialized by DNAG. Also, we are still in the process of developing and seeking regulatory authorization for the Coronavirus Self-Test and Coronavirus Antibody Test and validating the use of existing products for pan-SARS-coronavirus testing, and it is uncertain whether we will be successful in our development and validation efforts or whether these products will prove effective, receive applicable regulatory approvals, clearances or EUAs and gain\nwidespread acceptance in the marketplace. As such, there can be no assurance that any products or services will obtain significant market acceptance and fill the market need that is perceived to exist on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, it is possible that our expenses to develop and market any such products, including, without limitation our Coronavirus Self-Test and Coronavirus Antibody Test, will exceed any benefit in revenues, which may be short-lived, or that other products that compete with ours achieve commercial acceptable earlier than we do.\nWe May Not Realize Anticipated Revenue From Our COVID-19 Diagnostic Assays.\nWe are developing assays to detect antigen and antibodies to the coronavirus, which causes the infectious disease known as COVID-19. While we expect to see significant demand for our COVID-19 assays, other companies are working to produce or have produced tests for COVID-19 which may lead to the diversion of customers, including governmental and quasi-governmental entities, away from us and toward other companies. Moreover, the dangers posed by COVID-19 may subside over time. A number of preventative vaccines have recently been approved for use in human populations by regulatory agencies in the U.S. and Europe. The anticipated effectiveness of these vaccines will likely limit the spread of COVID-19 and potentially reduce the market size for COVID-19 testing.\nWe expect that, if and when the current COVID-19 pandemic subsides, there may be a significantly reduced demand for ongoing testing, and thus, for our COVID-19 assays. There is no guarantee that current or anticipated demand will continue, or if demand does continue, that we will be able to produce our COVID-19 assays in quantities to meet the demand. A significant decline in demand for our COVID-19 assays without a corresponding increase in our other businesses could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow and financial position.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic Has Significantly And Adversely Affected Our Consolidated Results of Operations, Financial Position and Cash Flows, and May Continue To Do So.\nAlthough we have experienced heavy demand for certain specimen collection devices for use in COVID-19 molecular testing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a positive impact on our performance, the duration and level of the demand for COVID-19 molecular testing is uncertain. We believe the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s adverse impact on its our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows will be primarily driven by: (i) the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic; (ii) the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on the U.S. healthcare system and the U.S. economy; and (iii) the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the development and deployment of vaccines.\nMarketing of Our COVID-19 Tests and Collection Kits Under EUAs From FDA Is Subject To Certain Limitations and We Are Required To Maintain Compliance With The Terms of The EUA, Among Other Things, And The Continuance of The EUAs Is Subject To Government Discretion.\nOn February 4, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) issued a declaration that the threat to public health posed by COVID-19 justifies the emergency use of unapproved in vitro diagnostics for the detection or diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Under Section 564 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d), because HHS has issued this declaration, the FDA Commissioner is authorized to issue EUAs to permit certain developers of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics to begin offering the tests for detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 without having completed the normally applicable FDA review and clearance or approval process for marketing authorization (with the related standards that would apply to demonstrate safety and effectiveness). The issuance of an EUA reflects an FDA conclusion that based on the totality of scientific evidence available to the FDA, it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective in diagnosing COVID-19, the known potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks, and there is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the emergency use of the product.\nDuring 2020, our ORAcollect\u00ae\u2022RNA and OMNIgene\u00ae\u2022ORAL collection devices were included in EUAs granted by the FDA to certain third parties for use in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and we have separately obtained EUAs for these products. Several other laboratories are pursuing the inclusion of our specimen collection devices for use with their SARS-CoV-2 assays. In addition, we intend to obtain EUAs for our new COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Self-Test and OraSure SARS-CoV-2 antibody ELISA. Although there are certain regulatory requirements the FDA has waived for the duration of the EUAs, we remain subject to specific conditions of the authorization, including ensuring appropriate labeling as approved by FDA specifically for purposes of the EUA, maintaining records of distribution to authorized laboratories, collecting data on occurrences of any false positives or false negatives, and tracking any adverse events.\nAs with other FDA-regulated products, issues could emerge during the course of the marketing and use of our products under an EUA that could impact our ability to continue the sale and distribution of these products (for example, compliance or product performance issues). The applicable EUA\u2019s remain effective only until the HHS declaration is terminated or revoked, and the FDA may also revoke an EUA if it determines the criteria for issuance are no longer met or other circumstances make such revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety. If that were to occur then in order market our diagnostic products or collection kits for the purpose of detecting COVID-19, we would be required to obtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals and be subject to the full and usual regulatory obligations for device manufacturers, including the Quality System Regulation under 21 CFR Part 820. It is possible\nthat we may not be able to obtain those clearances or approvals in a timely manner, or at all, and that one or more of our competitors may obtain the necessary clearances or approvals for their products before we do.\nIf Acceptance and Adoption of Oral Fluid Testing and Collection Products Does Not Continue, Our Future Results May Suffer.\nWe have made significant progress in gaining acceptance of oral fluid testing products, particularly for (i) HIV testing in the public health, hospital, insurance and other markets, and (ii) drugs-of-abuse testing in the workplace and criminal justice markets. Our subsidiary, DNAG, has also made significant progress in gaining acceptance of oral fluid collection products that are used with molecular testing applications including testing for SARS-CoV-2. However, the degree of acceptance for these products is uncertain, and one or more markets may resist the adoption of oral fluid products as a replacement for other testing or collection methods in use today. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to expand the use of our oral fluid testing products in these or other markets.\nHowever, clinical reference laboratories and hospital-based laboratories currently provide the majority of diagnostic tests used by physicians and other healthcare providers in the U.S. In certain international markets such as Europe, diagnostic testing is performed primarily by centralized laboratories. Our future sales will depend, in part, on our ability to expand market acceptance of rapid point-of-care testing by physicians, other healthcare providers and consumers and successfully compete against laboratory testing methods and products. We expect that clinical reference and other hospital-based laboratories will continue to compete vigorously against our rapid point-of-care products. Even if we can demonstrate that our products are more cost effective, save time, or have better performance or other benefits, physicians, other healthcare providers and consumers may resist changing to rapid point-of-care tests and instead may choose to obtain diagnostic results through laboratory tests. In addition, demand for our new rapid tests for SARS-CoV-2 or PrEP adherence may not develop consistent with our expectations. Our failure to achieve and expand market acceptance of our rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests with customers would have a negative effect on our future sales growth.\nWe Expect to Face Increasing Competition From Other Providers of Diagnostic Tests, Sample Collection Products and Molecular Laboratory Services.\nOur rapid point-of-care tests compete with similar point-of-care products made by our competitors. This competition is particularly evident with respect to our OraQuick ADVANCE\u00ae HIV-1/2 test and our HIV Self-Test. The Oragene\u00ae product line sold by our subsidiary, DNAG, competes against other molecular collection products, such as blood collection kits and buccal swabs and will likely face additional competition from collection devices similar in design and operation to our Oragene\u00ae and ORACollect\u00ae products. There are a number of products currently in or expected to enter the market for the detection of antibodies or antigen to SARS-CoV-2 that will compete with our COVID -19 diagnostic products once completed and authorized for sale.\nOur genetic and microbiome laboratory services business is expected to face increasing competition, primarily from large commercial reference laboratories, hospital-based laboratories and specialty laboratories. We believe there is significant opportunity in the markets for these services, particularly the microbiome market which is still in the early stages. As these markets evolve and expand, we expect competition for genomic and microbiome laboratory services to intensify.\nThere is significant competition, including from other companies and governmental organizations, to create rapid tests for COVID-19. Many of these entities have substantially greater resources (including capital and personnel) than we do. In addition, some of these entities are or may be further ahead in the development and commercialization of tests than we are. Even if we are successful in developing and marketing tests for COVID-19, there is no guarantee that competitors will not take market share from our offerings through more effective marketing or competitive pricing, higher quality or technological superiority.\nA number of our competitors are making investments in competing technologies, products and services, and several may have a competitive advantage because of their greater financial, technical, research and other resources. Some competitors offer broader product lines and service offerings, aggressively discount prices for their products and services and may have greater name recognition than we have. We also face competition from certain of our distributors or former customers that have created, or may decide to create, their own products to compete with ours. If our competitors take market share from our offerings through more effective marketing or competitive pricing, higher quality or technological superiority, our revenues, margins and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, our revenues and operating results could be negatively impacted if some of our customers use internally developed or acquired sample collection devices or services in order to reduce costs.\nOur Product Sales Cycles Can be Lengthy, and May Depend on Public Funding, Which Can Cause Variability and Unpredictability in Our Operating Results.\nThe sales cycles for certain of our products can be lengthy and unpredictable, which makes it more difficult to accurately forecast revenues in a given period and may cause revenues and operating results to vary from period to period. Sales of our products often\ninvolve purchasing decisions by large public and private institutions, may require many levels of approval and may be dependent on economic or political conditions and the availability of grants or funding from governmental or public health agencies which can vary from period to period in both amount and timing. For example, in past years our OraQuick ADVANCE\u00ae HIV-1/2 test has been purchased through bulk procurement or other funding provided by governmental agencies. Our OraQuick\u00ae HCV test has been purchased by customers who receive government funding, and we believe increased funding from the CDC and other agencies will be required to substantially increase the volume of HCV testing, especially in the public health market. We also sold large quantities of our OraQuick\u00ae HCV test to foreign governments and agencies for use in broad-based or country-wide HCV elimination programs. There can be no assurance that purchases or funding from these agencies will occur or continue. As a result, we may expend considerable resources on unsuccessful sales efforts or we may not be able to complete transactions at all or on a schedule and in an amount consistent with our objectives.\nOur Inability To Expand International Sales Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations.\nOne of our strategic priorities is to substantially expand our product sales internationally. An opportunity to accomplish this objective is with the sale of our OraQuick\u00ae HIV Self-Test in support of large self-testing programs in certain African countries and elsewhere. We are also working to expand international sales of our professional HIV and HCV products and our molecular collection kits. We believe there is a significant opportunity for international sales of our SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic products once these products are available for sale.\nWhile we believe international sales of these and other products represent attractive long-term opportunities with significant growth potential, there is no guarantee that these opportunities will materialize, continue or increase. Among other factors, competition from other cheaper products and the uncertainties of available funding could negatively impact the success of these opportunities. If international sales of these products do not occur or increase or if we are otherwise unable to expand international sales of our products, our revenues and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, market conditions in many countries often require that we sell our products at a price below our typical U.S. or European pricing in order to participate in these markets. As a result, sales in certain countries may contribute lower profit margins to our business. To the extent these international sales comprise a large or increasing part of our business, our gross margins will be negatively affected. In addition, we may have difficulty selling our products at a sufficiently low price to maintain or increase this business over the long term without funding support from public health entities, government agencies or other sources. If we are unable to obtain or continue this funding support at sufficient levels, or at all, our revenues and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nOur International Presence May Increase Our Risks and Expose Our Business to Regulatory, Cultural or Other Restraints.\nWe seek to increase revenue derived from international sales of our products. Our international sales accounted for $40.9 million or 24% of consolidated net revenues in 2020, $47.3 million or 31% of consolidated net revenues in 2019 and $44.9 million or 25% of consolidated net revenues in 2018. In addition, our subsidiary DNAG, which accounted for $97.3 million or 57% of consolidated net revenues in 2020, is operated in Canada. In 2019 we also recently acquired Novosanis, a company based in Belgium, and we may acquire other foreign companies as part of our business development efforts.\nA number of factors could adversely affect the performance of our business and/or cause us to incur substantially increased costs because of our international presence and sales, including those set forth below:\n\u2022\nUncertainty in the application of foreign laws and the interpretation of contracts with foreign parties;\n\u2022\nThe potential for inconsistent imposition of legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nCultural and political differences that favor local competitors or make it difficult to effectively market, sell and gain acceptance of our products;\n\u2022\nCultural and language differences that make international operations and business management more difficult;\n\u2022\nInexperience in international markets and territories and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nExchange rates, currency fluctuations, tariffs and other barriers, extended payment terms and dependence on international distributors or representatives;\n\u2022\nRegulatory requirements, including compliance with applicable customs regulations and the need to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals, registrations or reimbursement approvals for our products;\n\u2022\nTrade protection measures, additional trade sanctions and import/export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nThe inability to obtain or maintain ISO certification for our or our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\nOur inability to identify international distributors and negotiate acceptable terms for distribution agreements;\n\u2022\nDiversion to the U.S. of our products that are sold at lower prices into international markets;\n\u2022\nThe loss of one or more distributors and difficulties or delays in obtaining new or transferred product registrations or approvals for use by a replacement distributor;\n\u2022\nMultiple jurisdictions and differing tax laws, as well as changes in those laws;\n\u2022\nAn increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by a foreign subsidiary;\n\u2022\nThe creditworthiness of foreign distributors and customers and difficulty in collecting foreign accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nDifficulty of enforcing contractual obligations or recovering damages under foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nDifficulty collecting amounts owed by foreign governments or other customers;\n\u2022\nEconomic conditions, political instability, the absence of available funding sources, terrorism, civil unrest, war and natural disasters in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nExposure to infectious disease and epidemics, including the effects of the coronavirus outbreak on our business operations in geographic locations impacted by the outbreak and on the business operations of our customers and suppliers;\n\u2022\nLong sales cycles in international markets, especially for sales to foreign governments, quasi-governmental agencies and international public health agencies;\n\u2022\nThe sale of competing products by foreign competitors at prices at or below the prices we offer for our products;\n\u2022\nRestrictions on our ability to repatriate investments and earnings from foreign operations;\n\u2022\nChanges in shipping costs;\n\u2022\nThe unavailability of licenses to certain patents in force in a foreign country which cover our products; and\n\u2022\nReduced protection for, or enforcement of, our patents and other intellectual property rights in foreign countries.\nIn addition, we have contracted with a third party in Thailand for the manufacture of a portion of our OraQuick\u00ae tests, and all of DNAG\u2019s products are produced in Canada. We may enter into agreements to manufacture these or other products in additional foreign countries as well. However, economic, cultural and political conditions and foreign regulatory requirements may slow or prevent the manufacture of our products in countries other than the United States. Interruption of the supply of our products could reduce revenues or cause us to incur significant additional expenses in finding an alternative source of supply. Foreign currency fluctuations and economic conditions in foreign countries could also increase the costs of manufacturing our products in foreign countries. In addition, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has resulted in increased government-imposed travel restrictions and extended shutdowns of certain businesses in the affected locations. These or any further political or governmental responses to pandemic diseases could result in social, economic and labor instability of foreign countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur U.S. Government Contracts Require Compliance With Numerous Laws and Increases Our Risk and Liability.\nFrom time to time, we receive funding from the U.S. government and we sell some of our products to the federal government. As a result of our U.S. government funding and product sales to the U.S. government, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. U.S. government contracts typically contain a number of extraordinary provisions that would not typically be found in commercial contracts and which may create a disadvantage and additional risks to us as compared to competitors that do not rely on government contracts. As a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to increased risks of investigation, criminal prosecution and other legal actions and liabilities to which purely private sector companies are not. The results of any such actions could adversely impact our business and have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial performance.\nA violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts, as well as suspension or debarment. The suspension or debarment in any particular case may be limited to the facility, contract or subsidiary involved in the violation or could be applied to our entire enterprise in certain severe circumstances. Even a narrow scope suspension or debarment could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect our ability to renew contracts and to secure new contracts, both with the U.S. government and private customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow rules relating to billing on cost-plus contracts, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing\nfalse claims, among other potential violations. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm and the value of our common stock could be negatively affected if allegations of impropriety related to such contracts are made against us.\nOur U.S. Government Contracts May Affect our Intellectual Property Rights.\nProvisions in our U.S. government contracts may affect our intellectual property rights. Certain of our activities have been funded, and may in the future be funded, by the U.S. government, including our contracts with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (\u201cBARDA\u201d). When new technologies are developed with U.S. government funding, the government obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including the right to a nonexclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention. These rights may permit the government to disclose our confidential information to third parties and to exercise \u201cmarch-in\u201d rights to use and allow third parties to use our patented technology. The government can exercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the U.S. government-funded technology, because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations, or to give preference to U.S. industry. In addition, government-funded inventions must be reported to the government, government funding must be disclosed in any resulting patent applications, and our rights in such inventions may be subject to certain requirements to manufacture products in the United States.\nOur U.S. Government Contracts and Related Administrative Processes Are Subject to Audits and Cost Adjustments by the Federal Government.\nFederal government agencies can audit and investigate government contracts and the administrative processes and systems of government contractors. These agencies can review our performance on government contracts, pricing practices, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. They can also review our compliance with government regulations and policies and the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies, including our purchasing, accounting, estimating, compensation and management information processes and systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific government contract, unallowable or unreasonable will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed may be required to be refunded and certain penalties may be imposed. Adjustments arising from government audits and reviews could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nMoreover, if any administrative process or system related to such contracts is found not to comply with governmental requirements, we may be subjected to government scrutiny that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform government contracts or collect our revenue in a timely manner. An unfavorable outcome of an audit of our government contracts could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry, Business and Strategy\nConsolidation in the Healthcare Industry Could Adversely Affect Our Future Revenues and Operating Results.\nThe healthcare industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation. As a result of this consolidation, competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased. In addition, group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, which has also placed pricing pressure on medical device suppliers. We may not be able to compete successfully in such a consolidated industry. We believe industry consolidation may continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions and as more companies are acquired or cease operating. Further consolidation in the industry could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products.\nOur Research, Development and Commercialization Efforts May Not Succeed and Our Competitors May Develop and Commercialize More Effective or Successful Offerings.\nIn order to remain competitive, we must regularly commit substantial resources to research and development and the commercialization of new or enhanced products and services. The research and development process generally takes a significant amount of time from inception to commercial launch. This process is conducted in various stages. During each stage there is a substantial risk that we will not achieve our goals on a timely basis, or at all, and we may have to abandon a new or enhanced product or service in which we have invested substantial time and money.\nSuccessful products and services can require significant development and investment, including testing to demonstrate their performance capabilities, cost-effectiveness or other benefits prior to commercialization. Regulatory approval must be obtained before most products may be sold and additional development efforts on these products may be required before any regulatory authority will review them. Similarly, regulatory clearances or registrations, such as a CLIA certification, and compliance with industry guidelines, may be required in order to provide competitive laboratory services. As noted above, regulatory authorities may not issue such\napprovals, clearances or certifications or may substantially delay or condition such action. Even if a product or service is developed and all applicable regulatory approvals, clearance or certifications are obtained, there may be little or no market for the product or service and entry into or development of new markets for our products and services may require an investment of substantial resources, such as new employees, offices and manufacturing facilities. Moreover, we may spend a significant amount of money on manufacturing facilities, advertising or other activities and fail to develop a market for the product or service. Other factors that could affect the success of our efforts include our ability to manufacture products or provide laboratory services in a cost-effective manner and whether we can obtain necessary intellectual property rights and protection in the markets where the product or service is sold.\nStarting in 2020, we have been investing significant time and resources in developing two diagnostic products for SARS-CoV-2 and pursuing EUA for these products from the FDA. If these efforts are successful we believe these products could contribute significant revenues once commercialized. We are also investing significantly to expand our manufacturing capacity to ensure we can satisfy the expected demand for these products.\nIf we fail to develop and gain commercial acceptance for our products and services, or if competitors develop more effective products and services or a greater number of successful new products and services, customers may decide not to purchase our products and services or may purchase and use products and services developed by our competitors. This would result in a loss of revenues and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and business. Additionally, if we are not successful in commercializing our planned SARS-CoV-2 assays, the investment in expanded manufacturing capacity may not be fully utilized.\nAcquisitions or Investments May Not Generate the Expected Benefits and Could Disrupt Our Ongoing Business, Distract Our Management, Increase Our Expenses and Adversely Affect Our Business.\nSince the beginning of 2019, we have acquired several companies through which we have gained access to new technologies, products and services which are complementary to our existing business and aligned with our long-term business strategy. We will likely continue to pursue strategic acquisitions or investments as a way to expand our business. These activities, and their impact on our business, are subject to many risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nSuitable acquisitions or investments may not be found or consummated on terms or schedules that are satisfactory to us or consistent with our objectives;\n\u2022\nWe may be unsuccessful in competing for acquisitions with other entities, some of which have greater financial resources or may be better able to realize synergies with a potential target;\n\u2022\nThe benefits expected to be derived from an acquisition or investment may not materialize and could be affected by numerous factors, such as regulatory developments, insurance reimbursement, our inexperience with new businesses or markets, general economic conditions and increased competition;\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate an acquired company\u2019s personnel, assets, management, information technology systems, accounting policies and practices, products, services and/or technology into our business;\n\u2022\nWorse than expected performance of an acquired business may result in the impairment of intangible assets;\n\u2022\nAcquisitions may require substantial expense and management time and could disrupt our business;\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to accurately forecast the performance or ultimate impact of an acquired business;\n\u2022\nWe may have difficulties in coordinating geographically separate organizations;\n\u2022\nWe may fail to successfully manage relationships with customers, distributors and suppliers of an acquired business;\n\u2022\nAn acquisition may result in a diversion of resources from our existing products, business and technologies;\n\u2022\nAn acquisition and subsequent integration activities may require greater capital and other resources than originally anticipated at the time of acquisition;\n\u2022\nTo the extent we agree to pay contingent consideration for an acquisition, if and how much of such consideration we are required to pay may be subject to dispute, resulting in the distraction of our management team and the incurrence of legal costs;\n\u2022\nAn acquisition may result in employee anxiety, morale and/or engagement issues;\n\u2022\nAn acquisition may result in disparate information technology, internal control, financial reporting and record-keeping systems;\n\u2022\nAn acquisition may result in new partners or customers who may operate on terms and programs different than ours;\n\u2022\nAn acquisition may result in employees not familiar with our operations;\n\u2022\nAn acquisition may result in new products and services, including the risk that any underlying intellectual property associated with such products and services may not have been adequately protected or that such products and services may infringe on the proprietary rights of others;\n\u2022\nAn acquisition may result in the incurrence of unexpected expenses, stockholder lawsuits, the dilution of our earnings or our existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership, or potential losses from undiscovered liabilities not covered by an indemnification from the seller(s) of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nAn acquisition may result in the loss of our or the acquired company\u2019s key personnel, customers, distributors or suppliers; and\n\u2022\nAn acquisition of a foreign business may involve additional risks, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exposure, liability or restrictions under foreign laws or regulations, and our inability to successfully assimilate differences in foreign business practices or overcome language or cultural barriers and other inherent risks of operating in unfamiliar legal and regulatory environments.\nThe occurrence of one or more of the above or other factors may prevent us from achieving all or a significant part of the benefits expected from an acquisition or investment. This may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to grow our business or otherwise achieve our financial and strategic objectives.\nThere Are Risks Relating To Our Acquisitions of Diversigen, Novosanis and UrSure.\nThe success of the acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate our legacy business with those businesses. The integration of the businesses with our existing business can be complex, costly and time-consuming processes. It is possible that a number of factors, including, without limitation, the loss of key employees, higher than expected costs, diversion of management attention and resources, the disruptions of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisitions. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the Company for an undetermined period following the acquisitions.\nAs a general matter, the market for microbiome laboratory testing and analytical services provided by CoreBiome and Diversigen is at an early stage and is still developing. In addition, the Colli-Pee\u00ae urine collection devices manufactured and sold by Novosanis are relatively new products that are not yet widely accepted by customers. Although we are optimistic about the prospects for these new businesses, there is no assurance that we will be successful in creating or expanding demand for these services and products. To the extent that the markets for these services and products fail to develop or increase, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected and we may not meet our growth objectives.\nThe Future results of Acquired Companies May Be Adversely Impacted if We Do Not Effectively Manage Our Expanded Operations.\nFollowing the completion of recent acquisitions, the size of our business has increased and these acquisitions are expected to enhance our growth in future periods. Our ability to successfully manage this expanded business will depend, in part, upon management\u2019s ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration of the two companies, but also the increased scale and scope of the combined businesses with its associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that we will be successful and the acquisitions may have an adverse effect on the Company.\nOur Revenues Could be Affected by Third-Party Reimbursement Policies and Potential Cost Constraints.\nThe end-users of certain of our products include hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers. Use of our products could be adversely impacted if these end-users do not receive adequate reimbursement for the cost of our products from their patients\u2019 healthcare insurers or payors. Our net sales could also be adversely affected by changes in reimbursement policies of governmental or private healthcare payors, including in particular the level of reimbursement for our products.\nIn the United States, hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers who purchase diagnostic products generally rely on third-party payors, such as private health insurance plans, Medicare and Medicaid, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the product and procedure. The overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry, both foreign and domestic, to reduce the cost of products and services. Given the efforts to control and reduce healthcare costs in the United States in recent years, currently available levels of reimbursement may not continue to be available in the future for our existing products or products under development. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available or\nadequate in either the United States or international markets, current reimbursement amounts may be decreased in the future and future legislation, and regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors, may reduce the demand for our products or our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. In addition, the reimbursement approval process may delay the market introduction of our products.\nChanges in Healthcare Regulation Could Affect Our Revenues, Costs and Financial Condition.\nIn recent years, there have been numerous initiatives at the federal and state level for comprehensive reforms affecting the payment for, the availability of and reimbursement for healthcare services in the United States. These initiatives have ranged from proposals to fundamentally change federal and state healthcare reimbursement programs, including providing comprehensive healthcare coverage to the public under government-funded programs, to minor modifications to existing programs. One example is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Federal healthcare reform law enacted in 2010 (the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d). Similar reforms may occur internationally.\nLegislative and regulatory bodies are likely to continue to pursue healthcare reform initiatives in many forms and may continue to reduce funding in an effort to lower overall federal healthcare spending. The U.S. government recently enacted legislation that eliminated what is known as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d under the Affordable Care Act and may enact other changes in the future. The ultimate content and timing of any of these types of changes in other healthcare reform legislation and the resulting impact on us are impossible to predict. If significant reforms are made to the healthcare system in the United States, or in other jurisdictions, those reforms may increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nNew or Changed Testing Guidelines Could Affect Sales of Our Diagnostic Products.\nFrom time to time, governmental agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, issue diagnostic testing guidelines or recommendations, which can affect the usage of our HIV and HCV tests or other diagnostic products. For example, domestic professional OraQuick\u00ae HIV sales have decreased in part due to customer migration to automated fourth generation HIV immunoassays performed in a laboratory, as recommended under testing guidelines issued by the CDC. In addition, some states have promulgated, or may in the future promulgate, laws and regulations that affect HIV or HCV testing. The issuance of new laws or guidelines, or changes in existing laws or guidelines, and the manner in which these new or changed laws and guidelines are interpreted and applied by healthcare practitioners, could impact the degree to which our OraQuick\u00ae rapid HIV and HCV testing products or other products are used. New or changed laws or guidelines could affect the number of people tested, the frequency of testing and whether testing products such as our OraQuick\u00ae HIV and HCV tests are used broadly for screening large populations or in a more limited capacity as a confirmatory test or otherwise. These factors could in turn affect the level of sales of our products and our results of operations.\nReductions in Government Funding and Research Budgets Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Financial Results.\nWe sell our OraQuick ADVANCE\u00ae HIV-1/2 and OraQuick\u00ae HCV tests into the public health market which consists of state, county and other governmental public health agencies, community based organizations, service organizations and similar entities. We also sell these products into the hospital market. Many of these customers depend to a significant degree on grants or funding provided by governmental agencies to run their operations including programs that use our products. In international markets, we often sell products such as our OraQuick\u00ae HIV Self-Test to or through foreign governmental agencies or parties funded by such agencies.\nMany of our molecular collection products are sold to researchers at academic institutions, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, government laboratories and private foundations. Many research customers are dependent for their funding on grants from U.S. governmental agencies such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health and agencies in other countries to pay for the products and services they purchase. These research customers also purchase our genomic and microbiome laboratory tests and analytical services.\nThe level of available government grants or funding in the U.S. and elsewhere is unpredictable and may be affected by various factors including economic conditions, legislative and regulatory developments, political changes, civil unrest and changing priorities for research and development activities. Further, government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to government agencies in the U.S. and other countries that fund life sciences research and development activities. Any reduction or delay in government or other funding as a result of legislative or regulatory changes or other factors, could cause our customers to delay, reduce or forego purchases of our products and services.\nRisks Relating to Collaborators\nThe Use of Third Party Supply Sources For Critical Components of Our Products Could Adversely Affect Our Business.\nWe currently purchase certain critical components of our products from sole supply sources or other third-party suppliers. For example, the biological antigens and antibodies, nitrocellulose and certain other components required to make our OraQuick\u00ae HIV, HCV and Ebola products are currently purchased from sole source suppliers. Our OraSure QuickFlu\u00ae test and the fully automated high-throughput drug assays sold with our Intercept i2\u00ae device are manufactured and supplied by sole source suppliers and the conjugates used in our MICROPLATE oral fluid drugs-of-abuse assays are obtained from third-party suppliers. We have contracted with a third party in Thailand for the assembly of OraQuick\u00ae HIV device and the OraQuick\u00ae HIV Self-Test in order to supply certain international markets. In addition, our subsidiary, DNAG, uses three third-party manufacturers to supply virtually all of its products, including its Oragene\u00ae and ORAcollect\u00ae lines of collection kits. Many of the raw materials and components used in its products are also purchased from third parties, a critical one of which is obtained from a sole source supplier.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to contain the spread of the virus, could disrupt the normal operations of our third-party suppliers. Our third-party suppliers may not have the personnel, raw materials, capacity or capability to manufacture our products according to our schedule and specifications. To the extent any such production and distribution interruption or closures occur and continue for an extended period of time, the impact on our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If our third-party suppliers are unable or unwilling to supply or manufacture a required component or product or if they make changes to a component, product or manufacturing process or do not supply materials meeting our specifications, we may need to find another source and/or manufacturer. This could require that we perform additional development work and it may be difficult to find such an alternate supply source in a reasonable time period or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We may also need to obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals for the use of an alternative component or for changes to our products or manufacturing process. Completing that development and obtaining such approvals could require significant time and expense and such approvals may not occur at all. The availability of critical components and products from sole supply sources or other third parties could also reduce our control over pricing, quality and timely delivery. These events could either disrupt our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products into one or more markets or completely prevent us from doing so, and could increase our costs. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow and business.\nOur Failure to Maintain Existing Distribution Channels, or Develop New Distribution Channels, May Result in Lower Revenues.\nWe have marketed many of our products by collaborating with laboratories, diagnostic companies and distributors. Our sales depend to a substantial degree on our ability to sell products to these customers and on the marketing and distribution abilities of the companies with which we collaborate.\nRelying on distributors or others to market and sell our products could harm our business for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to find suitable distributors to distribute our products on satisfactory terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nOur distributors or other customers may not fulfill their contractual obligations to us or otherwise market and distribute our products in the manner or at the levels we expect;\n\u2022\nWe do not control the incentives provided by our distributors to their sales personnel and the effectiveness of these incentives could affect sales of our products;\n\u2022\nAgreements with distributors may terminate prematurely due to disagreements or may result in litigation between the parties;\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to renew existing distribution agreements on acceptable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nOur distributors may not devote sufficient resources or priority to the sale of our products;\n\u2022\nOur distributors may prioritize their own private label products that compete with our products;\n\u2022\nOur existing distributor relationships or contracts may preclude or limit us from entering into arrangements with other distributors; and\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to negotiate future distribution agreements on acceptable terms, or at all.\nAlthough we will try to maintain and expand our business with distributors and customers and require that they fulfill their contractual obligations, there can be no assurance that such companies will do so or that new distribution channels will be available on satisfactory terms. As a result, our revenues and business could be adversely affected.\nWe May Need Strategic Partners to Assist in Developing and Commercializing Some of Our Products.\nAlthough we may elect to pursue some product opportunities independently, opportunities that require a technology controlled by a third party, a significant level of investment for development and commercialization or a distribution network beyond our existing sales force may necessitate involving one or more strategic partners. Further, our ability to enter into agreements with additional strategic partners depends in part on convincing them that our products can help achieve and accelerate their goals and efforts. Our strategy for development and commercialization of products may entail entering into arrangements with distributors or other corporate parties, universities, research laboratories, government agencies, licensees and others. Relying on collaborative relationships could be risky to our business for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nWe may be required to transfer material rights to such strategic collaborators, government agencies, licensees and others;\n\u2022\nOur collaborators may not devote sufficient resources or attach a sufficiently high priority to the success of our collaboration;\n\u2022\nOur collaborators may not obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nWe have limited access to our collaborator\u2019s confidential corporate information and sudden unexpected changes in ownership or strategy or other material events affecting a collaborator of which we are not made aware of in a timely manner, or at all, could adversely impact our relationship;\n\u2022\nOur collaborators may be acquired by another company, sell the part of their business related to our collaboration, decide to terminate our collaborative arrangement or become insolvent;\n\u2022\nOur collaborators may develop technologies or components competitive with our products;\n\u2022\nOur collaborators may fail to deliver technologies or components that satisfy market requirements or such products may fail to perform properly;\n\u2022\nDisagreements with collaborators could result in the termination of the relationship or litigation;\n\u2022\nCollaborators may not have sufficient capital resources; and\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to negotiate future collaborative arrangements, or renewals of existing collaborative agreements, on acceptable terms or at all.\nWhile we generally expect that our collaborative partners will have an economic motivation to succeed in performing their contractual responsibilities, there is no assurance that they will do so, either at the level required or at all, and the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to these activities will be controlled by others. Reliance on strategic agreements can also make it difficult to accurately forecast our future revenues or operating results. There can be no assurance that the expected revenues or profits will be fully derived from such arrangements.\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property\nOur Success Depends on Our Ability to Protect Our Proprietary Technology.\nOur industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection, as well as other intellectual property rights, for new technologies, products and processes. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and maintain a strong intellectual property portfolio or obtain licenses to patents and technologies, both in the United States and in other countries. If we cannot continue to develop, obtain and protect intellectual property rights, our revenues and profits could be adversely affected. Moreover, our current and future licenses or other rights to patents and other technologies may not be adequate for the operation of our business.\nAs appropriate, we intend to file patent applications and obtain patent protection for our proprietary technology. These patent applications and patents will cover, as applicable, compositions of matter for our products, methods of making those products, methods of using those products and apparatuses relating to the use or manufacture of those products.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancements to protect our proprietary technology. We have entered, and will continue to enter, into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators. Our employees and third-party consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us interests in inventions and original expressions and any patents or copyrights arising from their work. However, these parties may not honor these agreements.\nWe cannot guarantee that the process of filing patents, the laws governing trade secrets and proprietary information, or any agreements we enter into with employees, consultants, advisors or collaborators will provide adequate protection of our intellectual\nproperty rights. For example, our competitors may develop similar products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights or design around our proprietary technologies. Employees, consultants and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property, and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach. We also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries, as many countries do not offer the same level of legal protection for intellectual property as the United States.\nFor a variety of reasons, we may decide not to file for patent, copyright or trademark protection outside of the U.S. Our trade secrets could become known through other unforeseen means. Although we have licensed certain technology for use in our microbiome laboratory services offerings and we have developed proprietary know-how that we use in this business, we do not currently hold any patents covering the laboratory processes and analytical methods offered to our customers. The absence of patent protection in this or other parts of our business may make it more difficult to protect our intellectual property. In addition, our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology.\nMoreover, issued patents remain in effect for a fixed period and after expiration will not provide protection of the inventions they cover. Once our patents expire, we may be faced with increased competition, which could reduce our revenues. We may also not be able to successfully protect our rights to unpatented trade secrets and know-how.\nSome of our employees, including scientific and management personnel, were previously employed by competing companies. Although we encourage and expect all of our employees to abide by any confidentiality agreement with a prior employer, competing companies may allege trade secret violations and similar claims against us. In addition, some of these agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants or advisers have prior employment or consulting relationships. An adverse determination may limit or restrict the type of work that certain employees involved with such products may perform.\nWe may collaborate with universities and governmental research organizations or receive funding for our products from government agencies. As a result, one or more of these entities may acquire part of the rights to any inventions or technical information derived from our collaboration or funding relationship with them.\nTo facilitate development and commercialization of a proprietary technology base, we may need to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from other parties. Obtaining and maintaining such licenses may require the payment of substantial amounts. In addition, if we are unable to obtain these types of licenses, our product development and commercialization efforts may be delayed or precluded. Moreover, some licenses may be nonexclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us.\nWe May Become Involved in Intellectual Property Disputes, Which Could Increase our Costs and Limit or Eliminate Our Ability to Sell Products, Provide Services or Use Certain Technologies.\nFrom time to time, we may seek to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights through litigation. In addition, there are a large number of patents and patent applications in our product and service areas, and additional patents may be issued to third parties relating to our product and service areas. We, our customers or our suppliers may be sued for infringement of patents or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights with respect to one or more of our products or services. Litigation in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights is prevalent and is expected to continue. We may also have disputes with parties that license patents to us if we believe the license is no longer needed for our products or services or the licensed patents are no longer valid or enforceable.\nOur industry is characterized by a large number of patents, and the claims of these patents appear to overlap in many cases. As a result, there is a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the extent of patent protection and infringement. Companies may have pending patent applications, which are typically confidential for the first eighteen months following filing, that cover technologies we incorporate in our products or services. Accordingly, we may be subjected to substantial damages for past infringement or be required to modify our products or services or stop selling them if it is ultimately determined that our products or services infringe a third party\u2019s proprietary rights. In addition, governmental agencies could commence investigations or criminal proceedings against our employees or us relating to claims of misuse or misappropriation of another party\u2019s proprietary rights.\nIntellectual property litigation is costly. As such, our involvement in litigation or other legal proceedings with respect to patents or other intellectual property and proprietary technology, either as a plaintiff or defendant, could adversely affect our revenues, market share, results of operations and business because:\n\u2022\nAs is common with major litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of managerial and financial resources;\n\u2022\nIts outcome would be uncertain and a court may find that our patents are invalid or unenforceable in response to claims by another party or that the third-party patent claims are valid and infringed by our products or services;\n\u2022\nAn adverse outcome could subject us to the loss of the protection of our patents or to liability in the form of past royalty payments, penalties, reimbursement of litigation costs and legal fees, special and punitive damages, or future royalty payments, any of which could significantly affect our future earnings;\n\u2022\nGovernmental agencies may commence investigations or criminal proceedings against our employees, former employees and us relating to claims of misappropriation or misuse of another party\u2019s proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nFailure to obtain a necessary license upon an adverse outcome could prevent us from selling our current products or services or other products or services we may develop or acquire;\n\u2022\nWe may be required to alter our product or services, given the proprietary rights of others;\n\u2022\nThe pendency of any litigation may in and of itself cause our distributors and customers to reduce or terminate purchases of our products or services; and\n\u2022\nA court could award a preliminary and/or permanent injunction, which would prevent us from selling our current or future products or services.\nWe may indemnify some customers and strategic partners under our agreements with such parties if our products, services or activities have actually or allegedly infringed upon, misappropriated or misused another party\u2019s proprietary rights. Further, our products or services may contain technology provided to us by other parties, such as universities, contractors, suppliers, customers or collaborators, and we may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. These other parties may also not be required or financially able to indemnify us in the event that an infringement or misappropriation claim is asserted against us.\nWe may also become involved in other types of disputes regarding intellectual property rights, including state, federal or foreign court litigation, and patent interference, patent reexamination, patent reissue, or trademark opposition proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Opposition or revocation proceedings could be instituted in a foreign patent office as well. Under Federal law, various forms of post issuance patent review proceedings have been authorized, including an inter-parties review process. These proceedings permit certain persons to challenge the validity of a patent on the grounds that it was known from the prior art. The filing of such proceedings, or the issuance of an adverse decision in such proceedings, could result in the loss of valuable patent rights that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nRegulatory Risks\nThe Need to Obtain Regulatory Approvals Could Increase Our Costs and Adversely Affect Our Financial Performance.\nMany of our proposed and existing products and services are subject to regulation by the FDA and other governmental or public health agencies. In particular, we are subject to strict governmental controls on the development, manufacture, labeling, distribution and marketing of our products and the processes and procedure for our laboratory services. Our practice is to train our employees on the legal requirements applicable to our business, including the requirements of the FDA and other relevant agencies.\nThe process of obtaining required approvals, clearances, premarket authorizations can involve lengthy and detailed laboratory testing, human clinical trials, sampling activities and other costly, time-consuming procedures. These approvals, clearances, other premarket authorizations or certifications can require the submission of a large amount of clinical data which can be expensive and may require significant time to obtain. It is also possible that a product will not perform at a level needed to generate the clinical data required to obtain such premarket authorizations. The submission of an application to the FDA or other regulatory authority does not guarantee that an authorization to market or import the product or a laboratory certification will be received. A regulatory authority may impose requirements as a condition to granting an approval, clearance, premarket authorization or certification that may include significant restrictions or limitations. The regulatory authority may delay or refuse to grant premarket authorization, even though a product has been approved or registered without restrictions or limitations in another country or by another agency. Delays in receipt or failure to receive such approvals, clearances, premarket authorization or certification could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are developing and are or will be seeking EUA for a rapid pan-SARS coronavirus antigen self-test and a lab-based SARS-CoV-2 oral fluid antibody test. There is no assurance that we will obtain an EUA for either or both of these products. Failure to do so could result in the loss of potential future revenues and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAll in vitro diagnostic products that are to be sold in the EU must bear the CE mark indicating conformance with the essential requirements of the IVDD. We have obtained the CE mark for several of our existing products. We also intend to apply for CE marks for certain of our future products and are not aware of any material reason why we would be unable to obtain those marks. However, there can be no assurance that compliance with all provisions of the IVDD will be demonstrated and the CE mark will be obtained or maintained for all products that we desire to sell in the EU. The failure to obtain or maintain the CE mark for one or more of our products could lead to the termination of strategic alliances and agreements for sales of those products in the EU.\nIn addition, we or our distributors are often required to obtain premarket authorization or product registration with foreign governments or regulatory bodies before we can import and sell our products in foreign countries. We may also be required to obtain WHO pre-qualification or endorsement in order to sell certain products in international markets or enable our customers to access interested funding sources for our products. We may have difficulty obtaining such authorizations, registrations, pre-qualifications or endorsements and, if obtained, such authorizations, registrations, pre-qualifications or endorsements may contain restrictions that limit our ability to market and sell our products in the relevant country. In addition, any change in our arrangement with a foreign distributor could result in the loss of or delay in transfer of any applicable product registrations, thereby interrupting our ability to sell those products in the affected markets.\nFailure to Comply With FDA or Other Regulatory Requirements May Require Us to Suspend Production or Sale of Our Products or Institute a Recall Which Could Result in Higher Costs and a Loss of Revenues.\nRegulation by the FDA and other federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies impacts many aspects of our operations, and the operations of our suppliers and distributors, including manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, recalls, distribution, storage, advertising, promotion and record keeping. We are subject to routine inspection by the FDA and other agencies to determine compliance with QSR and FDA regulatory requirements in the United States and other applicable regulations worldwide, including but not limited to ISO standards. We believe that our facilities and procedures are in material compliance with the FDA requirements and ISO standards, but the regulations may be unclear and are subject to change, and we cannot be sure that the FDA or other regulators will agree with our compliance with these requirements. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the performance of approved or cleared products or impose conditions on any product clearances or approvals that could restrict the distribution or commercial applications of those products. Regulatory agencies may impose restrictions on our or our distributors\u2019 advertising and promotional activities or preclude these activities altogether if a noncompliance is believed to exist. In addition, the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or additional regulatory actions, including withdrawal of the product from the market.\nFailure to comply with the applicable requirements of the FDA can result in, among other things, 483 notices, warning letters, administrative or judicially imposed sanctions such as injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to grant premarket clearance or PMA approval for devices, withdrawal of product registrations, marketing clearances or approvals, or criminal prosecution. The ability of our suppliers to supply critical components or materials and of our distributors to sell our products could also be adversely affected if their operations are determined to be out of compliance. Such actions by the FDA and other regulatory bodies could adversely affect our revenues, costs and results of operations.\nSome of our products, particularly those sold by DNAG, are sold for research purposes in the U.S. We do not promote these products for clinical diagnostic use and they are labeled \u201cFor Research Use Only\u201d, or RUO. If the FDA were to disagree with our RUO designation of a product, we could be forced to stop selling the product until appropriate regulatory clearance or approval has been obtained.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we must frequently make subjective judgments with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If regulators subsequently disagree with the manner in which we have sought to comply with these regulations, we could be subjected to substantial civil and criminal penalties, as well as product recall, seizure or injunction with respect to the sale of our products. The assessment of any civil and criminal penalties against us could severely impair our reputation within the industry and any limitation on our ability to manufacture and market our products could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur Inability to Respond to Changes in Regulatory Requirements Could Adversely Affect Our Business.\nWe believe that our products and procedures are in material compliance with all applicable FDA regulations, ISO requirements, and other applicable regulatory requirements, but the regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our products, the QSR and ISO requirements, and other requirements may be unclear and are subject to change. Newly promulgated regulations could require changes to our products, necessitate additional clinical trials or procedures, or make it impractical or impossible for us to market our products for certain uses, in certain markets, or at all. The FDA and other regulatory authorities also have the ability to change the requirements for obtaining product approval and/or impose new or additional requirements as part of the approval process. These changes or new or additional requirements may occur after the completion of substantial clinical work and other costly development activities. The\nimplementation of such changes or new or additional requirements may result in additional clinical trials and substantial additional costs and could delay or make it more difficult or complicated to obtain approvals and sell our products. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that these changes might have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur Inability to Manufacture Products in Accordance With Applicable Specifications, Performance Standards or Quality Requirements Could Adversely Affect Our Business.\nThe materials and processes used to manufacture our products must meet detailed specifications, performance standards and quality requirements to ensure our products will perform in accordance with their label claims, our customers\u2019 expectations and applicable regulatory requirements. As a result, our products and the materials used in their manufacture or assembly undergo regular inspections and quality testing. Factors such as defective materials or processes, mechanical failures, human errors, environmental conditions, changes in materials or production methods, and other events or conditions could cause our products or the materials used to produce or assemble our products to fail inspections and quality testing or otherwise not perform in accordance with our label claims or the expectations of our customers.\nAny failure or delay in our ability to meet the applicable specifications, performance standards, quality requirements or customer expectations could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products or comply with regulatory requirements. These events could, in turn, adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nWe Are Subject to Numerous Government Regulations in Addition to FDA Requirements, Which Could Increase Our Costs and Affect Our Operations.\nIn addition to the FDA and other regulations described previously, laws and regulations in some states may restrict our ability to sell products in those states. While we intend to work with state legislators and regulators to remove or modify any applicable restrictions, there is no guarantee we will be successful in these efforts.\nWe must also comply with numerous laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, disposal of hazardous substances, labor or employment practices and the configuration and operation of the websites through which we advertise our products. As a device manufacturer, we are required to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) any payments or transfers of value we have made to physicians and teaching hospitals and any physician ownership or investment interest in the Company. Compliance with these laws or any new or changed laws regulating our business could result in substantial costs. Because of the number and extent of the laws and regulations affecting our industry, and the number of governmental agencies whose actions could affect our operations, it is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and impact of these requirements. To the extent the costs and procedures associated with complying with these laws and requirements are substantial or it is determined that we do not comply, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFailure to Comply With Privacy, Security and Breach Notification Regulations May Increase Our Costs.\nIn the past, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) has generally affected us indirectly, as the Company is generally neither a Covered Entity nor a Business Associate, as further defined under HIPAA, to Covered Entities. We recently completed a merger of our wholly owned subsidiary, UrSure, Inc. Given that UrSure, Inc. collects certain protected health information, or PHI, it is a Business Associate subject to HIPAA. As a result of the merger, the PHI collected cannot be walled off from the Company and the Company is now subject to HIPAA. We have in place certain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the privacy and security of consumers\u2019 personal information and endeavors to comply with all applicable state and federal laws with respect to the protection of consumers\u2019 personal information. The Company is required to comply with varying state privacy, security and breach reporting laws. If we do not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to properly transferring data containing consumers\u2019 personal information, we could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. In addition to other federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of consumers\u2019 personal information, we may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues. Moreover, the potential for enforcement action against us is now greater, as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) can take action directly against Business Associates. Thus, while we believe we are and will be in compliance with all required HIPAA standards, there is no guarantee that the government will agree. Enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business. For example, we could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of consumers\u2019 personal information.\nFailure to Comply With Data Protection Requirements or Privacy Laws Could Increase Our Costs.\nThe European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) has adopted a comprehensive overhaul of its data protection regime from the prior national legislative approach to a single European Economic Area Privacy Regulation called the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which came into effect on May 25, 2018. The new EU data protection regime extends the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing data of EU residents. It provides for a harmonization of the data protection regulations throughout the EU, thereby making it easier for non-European companies to comply with these regulations. It imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide turnover and \u20ac20 million and includes new rights such as the \u201cportability\u201d of personal data. Although the GDPR will apply across the EU without a need for local implementing legislation, as had been the case under the prior data protection regime, local data protection authorities will still have the ability to interpret the GDPR, which has the potential to create inconsistencies on a country-by-country basis. We are implementing a plan to ensure compliance with these new requirements. Complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR may result in significant costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices. Further, we have no assurances that violations will not occur, particularly given the complexity of the GDPR, as well as the uncertainties that accompany new, comprehensive legislation.\nWe are also subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA imposes extensive new requirements and protections on the processing of personal data, aimed at giving California consumers more visibility and control over their personal information. Failure to comply with the CCPA or other data processing or security laws, or any changes in these laws, could adversely impact our business and our business plans.\nGiven the recent integration of UrSure, we now collect, process or maintain sensitive information, such as patient data and other personal information, on a limited basis. If we do use or not adequately safeguard that information in compliance with applicable requirements under state, federal and international laws, or if it were disclosed to persons or entities that should not have access to it, our business could be materially impaired, our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines, penalties and litigation. In the event of a data security breach, we may be subject to notification obligations, litigation and governmental investigation or sanctions, and may suffer reputational damage, which could have an adverse impact on our business. We are subject to laws and regulations regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information, including: (a) HIPPA and the regulations thereunder, which establish (i) a complex regulatory framework including requirements for safeguarding protected health information and (ii) comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information.\nFDA Regulation of Laboratory-Developed Tests and Genetic Testing Could Affect Demand For Our Products.\nThe FDA has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used to perform diagnostic testing by clinical laboratories. In the past, the FDA has taken the position that it has regulatory authority over laboratory-developed tests, or LDTs, but has exercised enforcement discretion in not regulating most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories. LDTs are tests designed, developed, and performed in-house by a laboratory. Such laboratories are subject to regulation under CLIA but have not been subject to regulation by the FDA under the agency\u2019s medical device requirements. A significant portion of the total volume of genetic or molecular testing is performed with LDTs.\nIn mid-2010, the FDA announced that it would begin regulating LDTs, including laboratory developed molecular tests, and in October 2014 issued proposed guidance on the regulation of LDTs for public comment. On January 13, 2017, the FDA released a discussion paper synthesizing public comments on the 2014 draft guidance documents and outlining a possible approach to regulation of LDTs. The discussion paper has no legal status and does not represent a final version of the LDT draft guidance documents. We cannot predict what policies will be adopted with respect to regulating LDTs.\nOur subsidiary, DNAG, sells its DNA collection systems to certain laboratories and other customers for use with LDTs. The FDA\u2019s increased regulation of LDTs could make it more difficult for laboratories and other customers to continue offering LDTs that involve genetic or molecular testing. This, in turn, could increase costs, delay the introduction of new LDT\u2019s and reduce demand for DNAG\u2019s products and adversely impact our revenues.\nIn 2019, the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) indicted a number of telemedicine companies and cancer genetic testing (\u201cCGx\u201d) laboratories for allegedly submitting fraudulent insurance claims to Medicare. A number of these companies were customers of DNAG. As a result of these activities, the FDA has issued letters to genetic testing laboratories indicating that it plans to increase oversight of this market which has caused some of these companies to stop providing testing options or to change how they are reporting the information provided by the testing. The activities have negatively affected this market and there is a risk that these enforcement actions will continue to negatively affect this market by forcing laboratories to either stop offering such services or restricting the use of such services. Such a reduction in testing could result in decreased sales of our DNA collection devices.\nOur International Sales Create Potential Exposure Under Anti-Corruption Laws.\nWe have a policy in place prohibiting our employees, distributors and agents from engaging in corrupt business practices, including activities prohibited by the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar foreign laws. In 2020, approximately $40.9 million of our consolidated net revenues were generated from sales in a variety of foreign countries. These international activities subject us to the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, enter into agreements with third parties and make sales in countries known to experience corruption. Further international expansion, including the acquisition of foreign entities, may create increased exposure to such practices. Our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors that could be in violation of various laws, including the FCPA, even though these parties are not always subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees and distributors, including employee training, contracts requiring compliance with the FCPA and similar rules, and standard reviews of our distributors. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may not prove to be effective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA and other laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions, which could be severe and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to the Economy, Our Financial Results, Investments, Credit Facilities and Need for Financing\nEconomic Volatility and Disruption, Including Those Related To The COVID-19 Pandemic, Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Performance, Results of Operations, Cash Flow and Financial Condition or Those of Our Customers and Suppliers.\nGlobal and U.S. markets and economies have experienced extreme volatility and disruption following the global outbreak of COVID-19 that began in December 2019. Many economists and major investment banks have expressed concern that the continued spread of the virus globally has led or will lead to a world-wide economic downturn. Volatile economic conditions may occur again or continue in the future.\nAlthough the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, impacts that we may experience include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\na slowdown or stoppage in the supply chain of the raw materials and components used to manufacture our products;\n\u2022\ninterruptions or delays in international shipment of our products to our distributors and customers;\n\u2022\ninterruptions in normal operations of certain end-use customers that could result in reductions in demand for our products;\n\u2022\ndisruptions to our operations, including a shutdown of our facilities or product lines; restrictions on our operations and sales, marketing and distribution efforts; and interruptions to our research and development, manufacturing, clinical/regulatory and other important business activities;\n\u2022\nshutdown or interruption of our manufacturing facilities due to contamination and costs incurred to clean and disinfect a facility following contamination;\n\u2022\ninefficiencies and increased costs in our production and shipping processes due to premium pay for manufacturing and certain other employees as well as social distancing and personal protective equipment requirements;\n\u2022\nlimitations on employee resources and availability, including due to sickness, government restrictions, the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people or mass transit disruptions;\n\u2022\na fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates could result from market uncertainties;\n\u2022\nan increase in exposure to credit losses for customers adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022\nan increase in regulatory restrictions or continued market volatility could hinder our ability to execute strategic business activities, including acquisitions.\nThese conditions could adversely affect our financial performance and condition or those of our customers and suppliers. These circumstances could also adversely affect our access to liquidity needed to conduct or expand our business or conduct future acquisitions or make other discretionary investments. Many of our customers rely on public funding provided by federal, state and local governments, and this funding has been and may continue to be reduced or deferred as a result of economic conditions or other factors. These circumstances may adversely impact our customers and suppliers, which, in turn, could adversely affect their ability to purchase and/or distribute our products or supply us with necessary equipment, raw materials or components. Any or all of these effects would have an adverse effect on our operations, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown, and it is difficult to predict the full extent of potential impacts the pandemic will have in the future on our business, operations, and financial results, or on our customers, suppliers or logistics providers, or on the global economy as a whole. It is uncertain how materially the COVID-19 pandemic will affect our global operations, particularly if the effects continue or get worse over an extended period of time. Even with the improvement of economic conditions, it may take time for our customers and suppliers to establish new budgets and return to normal purchasing and shipping patterns. We cannot predict the reoccurrence of any economic slowdown or the strength or sustainability of an economic recovery.\nAn Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets Could Reduce our Earnings.\nAt December 31, 2020, our consolidated balance sheet reflected approximately $40.4 million of goodwill and approximately $17.9 million of intangible assets. Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) require us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. Long-lived assets, such as intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The impairment review often cannot be done at the level of the individual asset and it must instead be applied to a group of assets. For the purpose of our annual goodwill impairment testing based on the current circumstances of how we manage or business, this group of assets is the Company as a whole. If we determine that any of our goodwill or intangible assets were impaired, we will be required to take an immediate charge to earnings and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe Have Experienced Losses in the Past and May Not Be Able To Maintain Profitable Operations.\nWe experienced annual net losses during the five years prior to 2015 and again in 2020. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $96.9 million. Even though we achieved profitability in 2015 through 2019, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain his profitability in the future.\nOur ability to continue profitable operations in the future will be dependent upon a number of factors including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022\nOur ability to continue growing sales of our molecular collection products and related genomic and microbiome laboratory services;\n\u2022\nOur ability to successfully commercialize a rapid pan-SARS coronavirus antigen self-test and a lab-based SARS-CoV-2 oral fluid antibody test;\n\u2022\nOur ability to mitigate declining sales of our OraQuick ADVANCE\u00ae HIV 1/2 test in the United States and expand sales of our OraQuick\u00ae HIV Self-Test internationally;\n\u2022\nChanges in customer buying patterns or a buildup of significant quantities in our distributors\u2019 inventories or distribution channels; and\n\u2022\nThe level of expenditures we are required to make in order to develop, obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize our new products;\n\u2022\nOur ability to expand our business through the acquisition of other companies or technologies or through internal development of new or improved products;\n\u2022\nOur ability to improve manufacturing efficiencies;\n\u2022\nOur ability to successfully launch new products after receipt of required regulatory approvals or the acquisition of rights to those products;\n\u2022\nThe degree to which our major distributors and customers comply with their contractual obligations, including minimum purchase commitments;\n\u2022\nWhether we are successful in obtaining and maintaining required regulatory approvals and registrations for our new products;\n\u2022\nThe level of competition, including the degree to which competitors sell lower priced products or more attractive offerings to compete with our products;\n\u2022\nChanges in economic conditions in domestic or international markets, such as economic downturns, reduced demand, inflation and currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nFailure to achieve our revenue growth targets;\n\u2022\nThe costs and results of patent infringement, product liability and other litigation or claims asserted by or against us.\nChanges in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results.\nOur financial statements are stated in U.S. Dollars and, historically, most of our international sales have also been denominated in U.S. Dollars. As a result, in the past our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk has not been material. Nonetheless, these sales are subject to currency risks, since changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the U.S. dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive. These exchange rate fluctuations could negatively impact international sales of our products, as could changes in the general economic conditions in those markets.\nIn addition, the revenues and expenses of our subsidiary, DNAG, are recorded in Canadian Dollars and the revenues and expenses of our subsidiary Novosanis are recorded in Euros. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results. Our expectation is that the businesses of our foreign subsidiaries will continue to grow and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates may be more significant than in past years.\nExchange rate fluctuations may affect the revenues and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries and the translation of those financial results into U.S. dollars. Favorable movement in exchange rates have benefited us in prior periods. However, where there are unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations, our consolidated financial statements including our balance sheet, revenues and results of operations, could be negatively affected. In addition, fluctuations in exchange rates could affect year-to-year comparability of operating results. In the past, we have not generally entered into hedging instruments to manage our currency exchange rate risk, but we may need to do so in the future. However, our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful. If we are unable to successfully hedge against unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements, our consolidated financial results may be adversely impacted.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur Stock Price Could Continue to be Volatile.\nOur stock price has been volatile, has fluctuated substantially in the past, may be volatile in the future and could experience substantial declines. The following factors, among others, could have a significant impact on the market for our Common Stock:\n\u2022\nThe performance of our business, including our efforts to increase sales of our OraQuick\u00ae HIV, HCV and Molecular Solutions products and our OraQuick\u00ae In-Home HIV test and HIV Self-Test;\n\u2022\nOur efforts to expand sales of our genomic and microbiome laboratory service offerings;\n\u2022\nOur efforts to commercialize a rapid pan-SARS coronavirus antigen test and a lab-based SARS-CoV-2 oral fluid antibody test;\n\u2022\nFuture announcements concerning us and our products or services, including with respect to significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations and joint ventures;\n\u2022\nAbility to achieve the expected benefits, enhanced revenue growth and synergies from strategic acquisitions;\n\u2022\nClinical results with respect to our products or services or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nThe status of clinical studies and pending submissions for required regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nThe announcement of regulatory or enforcement actions by the FDA or other agencies against us, our products or services, or one or more of our customers;\n\u2022\nThe gain or loss of significant contracts and availability of funding for the purchase of our products and services;\n\u2022\nDelays in the development, regulatory approval or commercialization of new or enhanced products or services;\n\u2022\nLegislative developments and industry or competitive trends;\n\u2022\nBiological or medical discoveries;\n\u2022\nDisputes or developments with key customers, distributors or suppliers;\n\u2022\nDevelopments in patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nLitigation or threatened litigation;\n\u2022\nComplaints or concerns about the performance or safety of our products and publicity about those issues, including publicity expressed through social media or otherwise over the internet;\n\u2022\nFailure to achieve, or changes in, financial estimates by securities analysts and comments or opinions about us by securities analysts or major stockholders;\n\u2022\nGovernmental regulation;\n\u2022\nChanges in the level of competition;\n\u2022\nLoss of or declines in sales to major distributors or customers or changes in the mix of products sold;\n\u2022\nPeriod-to-period fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nAdditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nGeneral market and economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nTerrorist attacks, civil unrest, war and national disasters, including pandemics.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of our Common Stock, as well as the stock of many companies in the diagnostics and life sciences industries. Often, price fluctuations are unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s stock, securities class action litigation has occurred against the issuing company. If we were subject to this type of litigation in the future, we could incur substantial costs and experience a subsequent diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Any adverse determination in this type of litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nFuture Sales of Our Common Stock by Existing Stockholders, Executive Officers or Directors Could Depress the Market Price of Our Common Stock and Make It More Difficult For Us to Sell Stock in the Future.\nSales of our Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could negatively impact the market price of our Common Stock. We are unable to estimate the number of shares of our Common Stock that may actually be resold in the public market since this will depend on the market price for our Common Stock, the individual circumstances of the sellers and other factors.\nWe have a number of institutional stockholders that own significant blocks of our Common Stock. If one or more of these stockholders sell large portions of their holdings in a relatively short time, for liquidity or other reasons, the prevailing market price of our Common Stock could be negatively affected. In addition, it is possible that one or more of our executive officers or non-employee members of our Board of Directors could sell shares of our Common Stock during an open trading window or pursuant to a 10b5-1 sales plan under our Insider Trading Policy. These transactions and the perceived reasons for these transactions could have a negative effect on the prevailing market price of our Common Stock.\nBecause We Do Not Intend to Pay Cash Dividends on Our Common Stock, an Investor in Our Common Stock Will Benefit Only if Our Stock Appreciates in Value.\nWe currently intend to retain our current earnings and future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our Common Stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our Common Stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which investors purchased their shares.\nCertain Provisions in Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and Under Delaware Law Could Make a Third-Party Acquisition of Us Difficult.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. We are also subject to certain provisions of Delaware law that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of us. These provisions could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe May Face Product Liability Claims for Injuries Resulting From the Use of Our Products.\nWe may be held liable if any of our products, or any product which is made with the use or incorporation of any of our technologies, causes injury of any type or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing, sale or usage. There is no assurance that we would be successful in defending any product liability lawsuits brought against us. Moreover, there is no assurance that our products will not be included in unethical, illegal or inappropriate research or applications, which may in turn put us at risk of litigation. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims could result in:\n\u2022\nDecreased demand for our products;\n\u2022\nLost revenues;\n\u2022\nDamage to our image or reputation;\n\u2022\nCosts related to litigation;\n\u2022\nIncreased product liability insurance costs;\n\u2022\nDiversion of management time and attention; and\n\u2022\nIncurrence of damages payable to plaintiffs.\nWe are selling the OraQuick\u00ae In-Home HIV test in the United States OTC market, and we offer HIV Self-Tests to consumers internationally. We believe the sale of products for use by consumers increases our potential exposure to product liability and other claims.\nPerformance of Our Products May Affect Our Revenues, Stock Price and Reputation.\nOur products are generally sold with labeling that contains performance claims approved or cleared by the FDA or other regulators. However, our products may not perform as expected. For example, a defect in one of our diagnostic or specimen collection products or a failure by a customer to follow proper testing procedures, may cause the product to report inaccurate information such as a false positive result or a false negative result. A false positive or negative result can also occur even when there is no apparent product defect and the customer has apparently used our product properly. Identifying the root cause of a product performance or quality issue can be difficult and time consuming.\nIf our products fail to perform in accordance with the applicable label claims or otherwise in accordance with the expectations or needs of our customers, customers may switch to a competing product or otherwise stop using our products, and our revenues could be adversely affected. Under such circumstances, we may be required to implement shipment holds or product recalls and incur warranty obligations, which would increase our costs. In addition, poor performance by one or more of our products and publicity surrounding such performance could have an adverse effect on our reputation, our continuing ability to sell products and the prevailing market price of our Common Stock.\nOur Ability to Sell Products Could be Adversely Affected by Competition From New and Existing Products and Services.\nThe markets we serve are highly competitive and rapidly changing and we expect competition to intensify as technological advances are made and become more widely known, and as new products and services reach the market. Many of our principal competitors have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. As new products and services enter the market, our products and services may become obsolete or a competitor\u2019s products and services may be more effective or attractive or more effectively marketed and sold than ours. In addition, there can be no assurance that our competitors will not succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for new products and services that would render our technologies, products and services obsolete or otherwise commercially unattractive, or introduce or commercialize such products and services before we can do so. If we fail to convince our customers of the advantages and economic value of our products and services or otherwise maintain and enhance our competitive position, our customers may decide to use products and services developed by competitors which could result in a loss of revenues. These developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also face competition from products that are sold at a lower price. Where this occurs, customers may choose to buy lower cost products from third parties or we may be forced to sell our products at a lower price, both of which could result in a loss of revenues or a lower gross margin contribution from the sale of our products. We may also be required to increase our marketing efforts in order to compete effectively, which would increase our costs.\nFailure to Achieve Our Financial and Strategic Objectives Could Have a Material Adverse Impact on Our Business Prospects.\nAs a result of any number of risk factors identified in this Annual Report, no assurance can be given that we will be successful in implementing our financial and strategic objectives, including our efforts to increase sales of our products and services or continue growing our business. In addition, the funds for research, clinical development and other projects have in the past come primarily from our business operations. If our business slows and we have less money available to fund research and development and clinical programs, we will have to decide at that time which programs to cut, and by how much. Similarly, if adequate financial, personnel, equipment or other resources are not available, we may be required to delay or scale back our business. Our operations will be adversely affected if our total revenue and gross profits do not correspondingly increase or if our technology, product, service, clinical and market development efforts are unsuccessful or delayed. Furthermore, our failure to successfully introduce new or enhanced products and services and develop new markets could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nIf We Lose Our Key Personnel or Are Unable to Attract and Retain Qualified Personnel as Necessary, Our Business Could be Harmed.\nOur success depends to a large extent upon the contributions of our executive officers, management and sales, marketing, operations and scientific staff. Our business may be harmed by the loss of a significant number of our executive officers or senior managers. We may not be able to attract or retain a sufficient number of qualified employees in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among medical products, laboratory services and other life science businesses. Our ability to recruit such employees will depend on a number of factors, including compensation, benefits, work location, the prospects of our Company, and the possibility for advancement within our organization. We generally do not enter into employment agreements requiring our employees to work for us for any specified period.\nIf we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to effectively market and sell our products and services, to meet the demands of our strategic partners in a timely fashion, or to support research, development and clinical programs. Although we believe we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, competition for experienced scientists and other qualified personnel from numerous companies and academic and other research institutions may limit our ability to do so on acceptable terms.\nIf Our Essential Employees Who Are Unable To Telework Become Ill or Otherwise Incapacitated, Our Operations May Be Adversely Impacted.\nAs a medical device manufacturer, we fall within a \u201ccritical essential infrastructure\u201d sector, specifically the \u201cHealthcare/Public Health\u201d sector, and are considered exempt under various stay at home/shelter in place orders. Accordingly, our employees may continue to work because of the importance of our operations to the health and well-being of citizens in the states in which we operate. Consistent with these Stay at Home Orders, we have implemented telework policies wherever possible for appropriate categories of \u201cnonessential\u201d employees. \u201cEssential\u201d employees that are unable to telework continue to work at our facilities, and we have implemented appropriate safety measures, including social distancing, face covering and increased sanitation standards. We are following guidance from the Center for Disease Control and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration regarding suspension of nonessential travel, self-isolation recommendations for employees returning from certain geographic areas, confirmed reports of any COVID-19 diagnosis among our employees, and the return of such employees to our workplace. Pursuant to updated guidance from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, we are engaging in limited and appropriate inquiries of employees regarding potential COVID-19 exposure, based on the direct threat that such exposure may present to our workforce. We continue to address other unique situations that arise among our workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic on a case-by-case basis. While we believe that we have taken appropriate measures to ensure the health and wellbeing of our \u201cessential\u201d employees, there can be no assurances that our measures will be sufficient to protect our employees in our workplace or that they may otherwise be exposed to COVID-19 outside of our workplace. If a number of our essential employees become ill, incapacitated or are otherwise unable to continue working during the current or any future epidemic, our operations may be adversely impacted.\nIncreases in Demand for Our Products and Services Could Require Us to Expend Considerable Resources or Harm Our Customer Relationships if We Are Unable to Meet That Demand.\nIf we experience significant or unexpected increases in the demand for our products and services, we and our suppliers may not be able to meet that demand without expending additional capital resources. These capital resources could involve the cost of new products, machinery or new manufacturing or laboratory facilities. This would increase our capital costs, which could adversely affect our earnings. Our suppliers may be unable or unwilling to expend the necessary capital resources or otherwise expand their capacity. In addition, new manufacturing or laboratory equipment and facilities may require FDA approval or government or industry certification before they can be used to manufacture our products or provide laboratory services. To the extent we are unable to obtain or are delayed in obtaining such approvals, our ability to meet the demand for our products and services could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to develop necessary manufacturing or laboratory capabilities in a timely manner, our sales could be adversely affected. If we fail to increase these capabilities in a cost effective manner or if we experience lower than anticipated yields or production or performance problems as a result of changes that we make in our manufacturing or laboratory processes to meet increased demand, we could experience delays or interruptions and increased costs, which could also have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nUnexpected increases in demand for our products may require us to obtain additional raw materials in order to manufacture products to meet the demand. Some raw materials require significant ordering lead time and some are currently obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We have long-term supply agreements with certain of these suppliers, but these long-term agreements involve risks for us, such as our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of raw materials and components and our reduced control over pricing, quality and timely delivery. It is also possible that one or more of these suppliers may become unwilling or unable to deliver materials to us. Any shortfall in our supply of raw materials and components, or our inability to quickly and cost-effectively obtain alternative sources for this supply, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet increased demand for our products. This could negatively affect our total revenues or cost of sales and related profits.\nOur inability to meet customer demand for our products and services could also harm our customer relationships and impair our reputation within the industry. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nWe Rely on Information Technology in Our Operations and Any Material Failure, Inadequacy, Interruption or Security Breach of that Technology Could Harm Our Ability to Efficiently Operate Our Business.\nWe rely heavily on enterprise resource planning and other complex information technology systems across our operations and on the internet, including for management of inventory, processing and analyzing laboratory specimens, purchase orders, invoices, shipping, revenue and expense accounting, online business, consumer call support, and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business, coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products, process and analyze specimens in our laboratories, respond to customer inquiries, and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems and the internet.\nThe failure of any of the foregoing systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or disruptions in the operation of the internet, could cause delays in product sales or the provision of laboratory services and reduced efficiency of our operations. Significant expenditures could be required to remediate any such problem.\nSecurity Breaches and Other Disruptions Could Compromise Our Information, Expose Us To Liability and Harm Our Reputation and Business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, personal information, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees in our data centers and on our networks. Secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations business strategy. We generally rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and domestically available monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing this sensitive date.\nCyber-attacks could result in unauthorized access to our computer systems or our third party IT service provider\u2019s systems and, if successful, misappropriate personal or confidential information. Spear phishing has occurred and is a growing threat that the Company is facing. If successful, these activities could lead to the disclosure of intellectual property or personally identifiable information, which could lead to financial harm and cause reputational damage. We have taken additional steps designed to improve the security of our networks and computer systems.\nIn addition, a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures or obtain such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving sensitive information. While we will continue to evaluate and implement additional protective measures to reduce the risk and detect cyber incidents, cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly. Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and third party training, monitoring of networks and systems and maintenance of back up of protective systems) which are continuously reviewed and upgraded, our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shut downs due to attack by hackers or breaches, voyeur or malfeasance.\nEven the most well protected IT networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in attempted security breaches are continually evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target or, in some cases, are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Any such compromise of our or our third party\u2019s IT service providers\u2019 data security and access, public disclosure, or loss of personal or confidential business information, could result in legal claims and proceedings, liability under laws to protect privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, and could disrupt our operations, require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result, and damage our reputation and customers willingness to transact business with us, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nAs our activities continue to evolve and expand, we may be subject to additional laws which impose further restrictions on the transfer, access, use, and disclosure of health and other personal information which may impact our business either directly or indirectly. Our failure to comply with applicable privacy or security laws or significant changes in these laws could significantly impact our business and future business plans.\nFederal and State Laws Pertaining to Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, laws constraining the sales, marketing and promotion of medical devices by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements that manufacturers of these products may enter into with physicians, hospitals, laboratories and other potential purchasers of medical devices, and laws requiring the reporting of certain transactions between manufacturers and healthcare professionals. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many of the existing requirements have not been definitively interpreted by state authorities or courts, and available guidance is limited. Unless and until we are in full compliance with these laws, we could face enforcement action and fines and other penalties, and could receive adverse publicity, all of which could materially harm our business. In addition, changes in or evolving interpretations of these laws, regulations, or administrative or judicial interpretations, may require us to change our business practices or subject our business practices to legal challenges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe May Experience Fluctuations in Our Financial Results or Fail to Meet Our Financial Projections.\nOur operating results can fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, which could cause our growth or financial performance to fall below the expectations of investors and securities analysts. Our financial projections for future periods are based on a number of assumptions, including estimated demand for our products. However, sales to our distributors and other customers may fall short of expectations because of lower than estimated demand or other factors, including continued volatility and disruption in economic conditions, increasing competition, seasonal fluctuations, changes in ordering patterns or business strategy, reduced governmental funding and other circumstances described elsewhere in this Annual Report. Infrequent, unusual or unexpected changes in revenues or costs could also contribute to the variability of our financial results.\nCustomers in certain of the markets we serve often submit a high percentage of purchase orders in the third month of a calendar quarter. Although this can vary from quarter to quarter, many customers make purchase decisions late in a quarter due to budgetary or financial requirements. In addition, certain governmental customers must fully spend budgeted funds by the end of their fiscal year or risk losing these funds, which can contribute to fluctuations in our sales from year-to-year. This can make it difficult to accurately forecast whether we will achieve our quarterly sales forecasts and can cause variability in our operating results.\nIn addition, our products provide different contributions to our gross margin. Accordingly, our operating results could also fluctuate and be affected by the mix of products sold and the relative prices and gross margin contribution of those products. Failure to achieve operating results consistent with the expectations of investors and securities analysts could adversely affect our reputation and the price of our Common Stock.\nWe May Require Future Additional Capital.\nOur future liquidity and ability to meet our future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nThe costs, scope and timing of strategic acquisitions;\n\u2022\nThe costs and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities;\n\u2022\nThe timing and success of the commercial launch of new products or services;\n\u2022\nThe extent to which we gain or expand market acceptance for existing, new or enhanced products and services;\n\u2022\nThe costs and timing of the expansion of our manufacturing and laboratory capacity;\n\u2022\nThe success of our research and product development efforts;\n\u2022\nThe time, cost and degree of success of conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nThe magnitude of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nChanges in existing and potential relationships with distributors and other business partners;\n\u2022\nThe costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents, proprietary rights and necessary licenses;\n\u2022\nThe costs and liability associated with patent infringement or other types of litigation; and\n\u2022\nCompeting technological and market developments.\nIf additional financing is needed, we may seek to raise funds through the sale of equity or other securities or through bank borrowings. There can be no assurance that financing through the sale of securities, bank borrowings or otherwise will be available to us on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nTerrorist Attacks, Natural Disasters, Public Health Crises or Other Catastrophic Events Outside of Our Control May Adversely Affect Our Business.\nTerrorist attacks, natural disasters, public health crises or other catastrophic events outside of our control, including pandemics, and subsequent governmental responses to these events, could cause economic instability. These actions could adversely affect economic conditions both within and outside the United States and reduce demand for our products. For example, the COVID-19 outbreak has led to, and for an unknown period of time will continue to lead to, disruptions in local, regional, national and global markets and economies affected thereby, including the United States. This outbreak has resulted in, and until fully resolved is likely to continue to result in, among other things: (i) restrictions on travel, government mandated social distancing measures, and the temporary closure of many corporate offices, retail stores, and manufacturing facilities and factories; (ii) significant disruption to the business of many companies, including our customers and suppliers, as well as layoffs of employees; (iii) reduction or termination by public health and other customers of infectious disease testing programs, including for HIV and HCV, and a reallocation of personnel and monetary resources from these programs to programs intended to address COVID-19; (iv) reduction or termination of clinical and research studies by academic and other entities that use our molecular collection products and laboratory services; and (v) rapidly evolving proposals and actions by state and federal governments to address the problems being experienced by markets, businesses and the economy in general, which may have unintended consequences or may not adequately address such problems. These events have disrupted, and threaten to continue to disrupt, our normal operation, the operations of our customers and suppliers and eliminate, reduce or delay our customers\u2019 ability to purchase and use our products and our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide raw materials and finished products. Despite our efforts to manage and mitigate the impact of these events on us, it is impossible to predict the precise nature and consequences of these events, or of any political or policy decisions and regulatory changes occasioned by emerging events or uncertainty under applicable laws or regulations that impact us. It is clear that these types of events are impacting and will, for at least some time, continue to impact our product development and operation and in many instances the impact may be adverse and may be material. Any potential impact to our results of operations will depend to a large extent on future developments and new information that could emerge regarding the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by authorities and other entities to contain the spread or treat its impact, all of which are beyond our control. These potential impacts, while uncertain, could adversely affect our business and results of operation.\nVarious types of disasters, including earthquakes, fires, floods, riots, acts of terrorism and pandemics, may also affect our manufacturing facilities and computer systems, and increase our cybersecurity risks. Although we have business interruption insurance, our facilities, including some pieces of manufacturing equipment and our computer systems, may be difficult to replace and could require substantial replacement lead-time. In the event our existing manufacturing facilities or computer systems are affected by man-made or natural disasters, including pandemics, we may have difficulty operating our business and may be unable to manufacture products for sale or meet customer demands or sales projections. If our manufacturing operations were curtailed or shut down entirely, it would seriously harm our business. Moreover, we may incur incremental costs following an unforeseen event which could adversely affect our results of operation.\nFuture Sales of Shares of Our Common Stock Could Adversely Affect the Trading Price of Our Common Stock and Our Ability to Raise Funds in New Equity Offerings.\nFuture sales of a substantial number of our shares of Common Stock or equity-related securities in the public market or privately, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our Common Stock, and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any,\nthat future sales of shares of Common Stock or the availability of shares of Common Stock for future sale will have on the trading price of our Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 10860, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "OSUR"}
