{"cik": "1446159", "company": "Skyline Medical Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including our financial statements and related notes.\nWe will require additional financing to finance operating expenses and fulfill our business plan. Such financing will be dilutive. Our independent public accounting firm has indicated in their audit opinion, contained in our financial statements, that they have serious doubts about our ability to remain a going concern.\nWe have not achieved profitability and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses at least through the first two quarters of 2016. We had revenues of $654,000 in 2015, but we had negative operating cash flows of $7.5 million. In August 2015, we received proceeds of $13.5 million (net of commissions but before payment of expenses) as a result of our public offering. During the remainder of 2015, we paid $5.8 million in cash to cover accrued debts and obligations, most of which were required to be paid upon completion of the offering or were considered past due. Our cash balance was $4.9 million as of December 31, 2015, and our accounts payable and accrued expenses were an aggregate $1.5 million. We are currently incurring negative operating cash flows of approximately $275,000 per month. Although we are attempting to curtail our expenses, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reduce these expenses significantly, and expenses for some periods may be higher as we prepare our product for broader sales, increase our sales efforts and maintain adequate inventories.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had no debt. We will require additional funding to finance operating expenses and to invest in our sales organization and new product development and to enter the international marketplace. We will attempt to raise these funds through equity or debt financing, alternative offerings or other means. If we are successful in securing adequate funding we plan to make significant capital or equipment investments, and we will also continue to make human resource additions over the next 12 months. Such additional financing will be dilutive to existing stockholders, and there is no assurance that such financing will be available upon acceptable terms. If such financing or adequate funds from operations are not available, we will be forced to limit our business activities, which will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of the above factors, our independent registered public accounting firm has indicated in their audit opinion, contained in our financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, that they have serious doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nOur limited operating history makes evaluation of our business difficult.\nWe were formed on April 23, 2002 and to date have generated only moderate revenue year by year. Our ability to implement a successful business plan remains unproven and no assurance can be given that we will ever generate sufficient revenues to sustain our business. We have a limited operating history which makes it difficult to evaluate our performance. You must consider our prospects in light of these risks and the expenses, technical obstacles, difficulties, market penetration rate and delays frequently encountered in connection with the development of new businesses. These factors include uncertainty as to whether we will be able to:\n\u00b7 Be successful in uncertain markets;\n\u00b7 Respond effectively to competitive pressures;\n\u00b7 Successfully address intellectual property issues of others;\n\u00b7 Protect and expand our intellectual property rights; and\n\u00b7 Continue to develop and upgrade our products.\nOur business is dependent upon proprietary intellectual property rights, which if we were unable to protect, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trade secret and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect our intellectual property. We currently own and may in the future own or license additional patent rights or trade secrets in the U.S., with non-provisional patents elsewhere in the world that cover certain of our products. We rely on patent laws and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our products and intangible assets. These intellectual property rights are important to our ongoing operations and no assurance can be given that any measure we implement will be sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights. Also, with respect to our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, we cannot be certain that the confidentiality agreements we have entered into with employees will not be breached, or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach. We may lose the protection afforded by these rights through patent expirations, legal challenges or governmental action. If we cannot protect our rights, we may lose our competitive advantage if these patents were found to be invalid in the jurisdictions in which we sell or plan to sell our products. The loss of our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we become subject to intellectual property actions, this could hinder our ability to deliver our products and services and our business could be negatively impacted.\nWe may be subject to legal or regulatory actions alleging intellectual property infringement or similar claims against us. Companies may apply for or be awarded patents or have other intellectual property rights covering aspects of our technologies or businesses. Moreover, if it is determined that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, we may be prevented from marketing our products. While we are currently not subject to any material intellectual property litigation, any future litigation alleging intellectual property infringement could be costly, particularly in light of our limited resources. Similarly, if we determine that third parties are infringing on our patents or other intellectual property rights, our limited resources may prevent us from litigating or otherwise taking actions to enforce our rights. Any such litigation or inability to enforce our rights could require us to change our business practices, hinder or prevent our ability to deliver our products and services, and result in a negative impact to our business. Expansion of our business via product line enhancements or new product lines to drive increased growth in current or new markets may be inhibited by the intellectual property rights of our competitors and/or suppliers. Our inability to successfully mitigate those factors may significantly reduce our market opportunity and subsequent growth.\nWe face significant competition, including competition from companies with considerably greater resources than ours, and if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies, our market share may decline and our business could be harmed.\nOur industry is highly competitive with numerous competitors ranging from well-established manufacturers to innovative start-ups. A number of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution resources than we do. Their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to compete more effectively on the basis of price and production and more quickly develop new products and technologies.\nWe estimate that the total market for surgical suction canisters is approximately $94 million and we estimate the total cost of using surgical canisters is a greater than $94 million because this amount does not include the labor to handle the canisters, disposal costs and solidifying compounds commonly used to minimize exposure to health care workers. Our competitors include Cardinal Health, Inc., a medical manufacturer and distributor, and Stryker Instruments, a wholly owned subsidiary of Stryker Corporation, which has a leading position in our market. Both of these competitors are substantially larger than our company and are better capitalized than we are.\nCompanies with significantly greater resources than ours may be able to reverse engineer our products and/or circumvent our intellectual property position. Such action, if successful, would greatly reduce our competitive advantage in the marketplace.\nWe believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including our technical innovations of unlimited suction and unlimited capacity capabilities, our innovative and advanced research and development capabilities, strength of our intellectual property rights, sales and distribution channels and advanced manufacturing capabilities. We plan to employ these and other elements as we develop our products and technologies, but there are many other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand our development and marketing of new products, which could adversely impact the trading price of the shares of our common stock.\nOur business is subject to intense governmental regulation and scrutiny, both in the U.S. and abroad.\nThe production, marketing, and research and development of our product is subject to extensive regulation and review by the FDA and other governmental authorities both in the United States and abroad. In addition to testing and approval procedures, extensive regulations also govern marketing, manufacturing, distribution, labeling, and record keeping. If we do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, violations could result in warning letters, non-approvals, suspensions of regulatory approvals, civil penalties and criminal fines, product seizures and recalls, operating restrictions, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.\nPeriodically, legislative or regulatory proposals are introduced that could alter the review and approval process relating to medical products. It is possible that the FDA will issue additional regulations further restricting the sale of our present or proposed products. Any change in legislation or regulations that govern the review and approval process relating to our current and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain approval for new products, or to produce, market, and distribute existing products.\nIf our product is not accepted by our potential customers, it is unlikely that we will ever become profitable.\nThe medical industry has historically used a variety of technologies for fluid waste management. Compared to these conventional technologies, our technology is relatively new, and the number of companies using our technology is limited. The commercial success of our product will depend upon the widespread adoption of our technology as a preferred method by hospitals and surgical centers. In order to be successful, our product must meet the technical and cost requirements for these facilities. Market acceptance will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the willingness and ability of customers to adopt new technologies;\n\u00b7 our ability to convince prospective strategic partners and customers that our technology is an attractive alternative to conventional methods used by the medical industry;\n\u00b7 our ability to select and execute agreements with effective distributors to market and sell our product; and\n\u00b7 our ability to assure customer use of the Skyline proprietary cleaning fluid and in-line filter.\nBecause of these and other factors, our product may not gain market acceptance or become the industry standard for the health care industry. The failure of such companies to purchase our products would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf demand for our product is unexpectedly high, we may be unable to produce the product in sufficiently high quantity to meet demands.\nWe are currently manufacturing the STREAMWAY FMS, following GMP compliance regulations of the FDA, at our own facility and anticipate the capability of producing the STREAMWAY FMS in sufficient quantities for future near term sales. We have contracted with a manufacturing company that can manufacture products at higher volumes. However, if demand for our product in unexpectedly high, there is no assurance that we or our manufacturing partners will be able to produce the product in sufficiently high quantity to satisfy demands. Any supply interruptions or inadequate supply would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on a few key executive officers for our success. Our inability to retain those officers would impede our business plan and growth strategies, which would have a negative impact on our business and the value of an investment.\nOur success depends on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our management team. We heavily depend on our management team: Joshua Kornberg, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chairman of the Board, David O. Johnson, our Chief Operating Officer, and Bob Myers, our Chief Financial Officer. We have entered into employment agreements with all members of our senior management team and we may expand the relatively small number of executives in our company. Were we to lose one or more of these key individuals, we would be forced to expend significant time and money in the pursuit of a replacement, which could result in both a delay in the implementation of our business plan and the diversion of our limited working capital. We can give you no assurance that we can find satisfactory replacements for these key individuals at all, or on terms that are not unduly expensive or burdensome to our company.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to attract and retain technical personnel, sales and marketing personnel, and other skilled management.\nOur success depends to a significant degree on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel. Failure to attract and retain necessary technical, sales and marketing personnel and skilled management could adversely affect our business. If we fail to attract, train and retain sufficient numbers of these highly qualified people, our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nCosts incurred because we are a public company may affect our profitability.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses, and we are subject to the SEC\u2019s rules and regulations relating to public disclosure that generally involve a substantial expenditure of financial resources. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, requires changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. We expect that full compliance with such rules and regulations will significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly, which may negatively impact our financial results. To the extent our earnings suffer as a result of the financial impact of our SEC reporting or compliance costs, our ability to develop an active trading market for our securities could be harmed.\nThere is currently a limited public trading market for our common stock and we cannot assure you that a more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained. Even if a market further develops, you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if you need to sell your shares to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.\nThere is currently a limited public trading market for our common stock. The numbers of institutions or persons interested in purchasing our common stock at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or nonexistent. This situation may be attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company that is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume. Even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk averse and may be reluctant to follow a relatively unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we become more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot assure you that an active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained.\nLimitations on director and officer liability and indemnification of our officers and directors by us may discourage stockholders from bringing suit against a director.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide, with certain exceptions as permitted by governing state law, that a director or officer shall not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct, fraud or knowing violation of law, or unlawful payments of dividends. These provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by stockholders on our behalf against a director. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may provide for mandatory indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by governing state law.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and we may never pay dividends.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings to support the development and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including but not limited to, our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may be limited by state law. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize certain returns on their investment.\nThe Company completed a private offering in February 2014 issuing Series A Convertible Preferred Stock paying dividends at 6% of the Stated Value per annum on a quarterly basis (see \u201cSubsequent Events\u201d in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report).\nOur stock may be thinly traded.\nOur common stock has been thinly traded, meaning there has been a low volume of buyers and sellers of the shares. Through this registration statement, we went public without the typical initial public offering procedures which usually include a large selling group of broker-dealers who may provide market support after going public. Thus, we will be required to undertake efforts to develop market recognition and support for our shares of common stock in the public market. The price and trading volume of our registered common stock cannot be assured. The numbers of institutions or persons interested in purchasing our registered common stock at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation may be attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days, weeks or months when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price.\nWe cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained.\nThe application of the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules to our common stock could limit the trading and liquidity of the common stock and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs long as the trading price of our common stock is below $5.00 per share, the open-market trading of our common stock will be subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules, unless we otherwise qualify for an exemption from the \u201cpenny stock\u201d definition. The \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules impose additional sales practice requirements on certain broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with net assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 together with their spouse). These regulations, if they apply, require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the associated risks. Under these regulations, certain brokers who recommend such securities to persons other than established customers or certain accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination regarding such a purchaser and receive such purchaser\u2019s written agreement to a transaction prior to sale. These regulations may have the effect of limiting the trading activity of our common stock, reducing the liquidity of an investment in our common stock and increasing the transaction costs for sales and purchases of our common stock as compared to other securities.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market.\nFrom time to time, certain stockholders may be eligible to sell some or all of their shares of common stock pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144 as in effect as of the date of this registration statement, a stockholder (or stockholders whose shares are aggregated) who has satisfied the applicable holding period and is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of sale, or at any time during the three months preceding a sale, may sell their shares of common stock. Any substantial sale, or cumulative sales, of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any resale prospectus may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nWe expect volatility in the price of our common stock, which may subject us to securities litigation.\nIf established, the market for our common stock may be characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In addition, there is no assurance that the price of our common stock will not be volatile. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur Board of Directors\u2019 ability to issue undesignated preferred stock and the existence of anti-takeover provisions may depress the value of our common stock.\nOur authorized capital includes 20 million shares of preferred stock. Of this amount, 18,950 shares have been designated as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and the remaining authorized shares are undesignated preferred stock. Our Board of Directors has the power to issue any or all of the shares of undesignated preferred stock, including the authority to establish one or more series and to fix the powers, preferences, rights and limitations of such class or series, without seeking stockholder approval. Further, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law regarding \u201cbusiness combinations.\u201d We may, in the future, consider adopting additional anti-takeover measures. The authority of our Board of Directors to issue undesignated stock and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, as well as any future anti-takeover measures adopted by us, may, in certain circumstances, delay, deter or prevent takeover attempts and other changes in control of the company not approved by our Board of Directors. As a result, our stockholders may lose opportunities to dispose of their shares at favorable prices generally available in takeover attempts or that may be available under a merger proposal and the market price, voting and other rights of the holders of common stock may also be affected.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our share price to fall.\nWe also expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities, or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders. In addition, in the past, we have issued warrants to acquire shares of common stock. To the extent these warrants are ultimately exercised, you will sustain further dilution.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market may cause our stock price to decline and impair our ability to raise future capital through the sale of our equity securities.\nThere are a substantial number of shares of or common stock held by stockholders who owned shares of our capital stock prior to this offering that may be able to sell in the public market upon expiration of the 90-day lock-up agreements they signed in connection with the Company\u2019s public offering which was consummated in August 2015. Sales by such stockholders of a substantial number of shares could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.\nThe Series A Warrants contain a cashless exercise feature with the potential for a higher dilutive issuance of Common Stock, which could adversely affect the value of the Common Stock.\nThe Series A Warrants, described in Note 3 to the Financial Statements included in this report under \u201cStockholders\u2019 Deficit, Stock Options and Warrants,\u201d can be exercised starting February 2016. The Series A Warrants contain a cashless exercise feature that provides for the issuance of a number of shares of our common stock that increases as the trading market price of our common stock decreases, subject to a floor price of $0.43. Approximately 3,390,935 Series A Warrants have been exercised in cashless exercises as of March 11, 2016, resulting in the issuance of 34,053,653 shares of common stock. If all of the remaining 4,189,105 Series A Warrants that were issued as part of the Units sold in the Offering and part of the Units issued on August 31, 2015 were exercised pursuant to a cashless exercise and the closing bid price of our common stock as of the two trading days prior to the time of such exercise was $0.43 per share or less and the Black Scholes Value were $4.3246 (the Black Scholes Value as of March 11, 2016), then a total of approximately 76,184,359 shares of our common stock would be issued to the holders of such Series A Warrants. The potential for such dilutive exercise of the Series A Warrants may depress the price of our common stock regardless of the Company\u2019s business performance, and could encourage short selling by market participants, especially if the trading price of our common stock begins to decrease.\nFrom our inception, through December 2013, our shares and other securities were issued in violation of the preemptive rights of existing stockholders, which could result in claims against us.\nIn 2013, it was brought to the attention of our management and Board of Directors that the Company was subject to preemptive rights under Minnesota corporate law, because the articles of incorporation did not \u201copt out\u201d and deny them. Prior to our reincorporation in Delaware in December 2013 the Company issued shares of common stock and other equity securities on numerous occasions to raise capital and for other purposes and, to our knowledge; we never complied with the Minnesota preemptive rights statute in connection with such issuances. Starting in December 2013, stockholders no longer had preemptive rights. In connection with issuances of securities prior to that time, we may be still subject to the claims of previous and current stockholders based on violations of their preemptive rights; the risk and magnitude of these claims are uncertain. If there are any future claims, we intend to vigorously defend against such claims; however, there can be no assurance that the Company would not be liable for damages or other remedies that might have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 15645, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "POAI"}
