{"cik": "1499912", "company": "Global Brokerage, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties set forth below are those that we currently believe may materially and adversely affect us, our future business or results of operations, or investments in our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect us, our future business or results of operations, or investments in our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur revenue and profitability are influenced by trading volume and currency volatility, which are directly impacted by domestic and international market and economic conditions that are beyond our control.\nOur revenue is influenced by the general level of trading activity in the FX market. It is difficult to predict volatility and its effects in the FX markets. Our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due primarily to movements and trends in the world\u2019s currency markets and to fluctuations in trading levels. We have generally experienced greater trading volume and higher revenue in periods of volatile currency markets. Significant swings in the market volatility can also result in increased customer trading losses, higher turnover and reduced trading volume. In the event we experience lower levels of currency volatility, our revenue and profitability may be negatively affected.\nLike other financial services firms, our business and profitability are directly affected by factors that are beyond our control, such as economic and political conditions, government actions like the unexpected actions of the SNB on January 15, 2015, broad trends in business and finance, changes in the volume of foreign currency transactions, changes in supply and demand for currencies, movements in currency exchange rates, changes in the financial strength of market participants, legislative and regulatory changes, changes in the markets in which such transactions occur, changes in how such transactions are processed and disruptions due to terrorism, war or extreme weather events. Any one or more of these factors, or other factors, may adversely affect our business and results of operations and cash flows. A weakness in equity markets could result in reduced trading activity in the FX market and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. As a result, period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and our future operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations or declines.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not be effective and may leave us exposed to unidentified or unexpected risks.\nWe are dependent on our risk management policies and the adherence to such policies by our trading staff. Our policies, procedures and practices are used to identify, monitor and control a variety of risks, including risks related to market exposure, human error, customer defaults, market movements, fraud and money-laundering. Some of our methods for managing risk are discretionary by nature and are based on internally developed controls and observed historical market behavior, and also involve reliance on standard industry practices. These methods may not adequately prevent losses, particularly as they relate to extreme market movements, which may be significantly greater than historical changes in market prices. Our risk management methods also may not adequately prevent losses due to technical errors if our testing and quality control practices are not effective in preventing software or hardware failures. In addition, we may elect to adjust our risk management policies to allow for an increase in risk tolerance, which could expose us to the risk of greater losses. Our risk management methods rely on a combination of technical and human controls and supervision that are subject to error and failure. These methods may not protect us against all risks or may protect us less than anticipated, in which case our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend on our proprietary technology. Any disruption or corruption of our proprietary technology or our inability to maintain technological superiority in our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. We may experience failures while developing our proprietary technology.\nWe rely on our proprietary technology to receive and properly process internal and external data. Any disruption for any reason in the proper functioning, or any corruption, of our software or erroneous or corrupted data may cause us to make erroneous trades, accept customers from jurisdictions where we do not possess the proper licenses, authorizations or permits, or require us to suspend our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. For example, our technology platform includes a real time margin-watcher feature to ensure that open positions are automatically closed out if a customer becomes at risk of going into a negative balance on his or her account. If we experience extreme market dysfunction, like the EUR/CHF flash crash following the SNB\u2019s January 15, 2015 announcement that it would allow the value of the Swiss Franc to fluctuate against the Euro, we may not be able to close out a\ncustomer\u2019s position to avoid a negative equity balance. Any disruption or corruption of this feature would subject us to the risk that amounts owed to us by such customer exceed the collateral in such customer\u2019s account.\nIn order to remain competitive, we need to continuously develop and redesign our proprietary technology. In doing so, there is an ongoing risk that failures may occur and result in service interruptions or other negative consequences, such as slower quote aggregation, slower trade execution, erroneous trades, or mistaken risk management information.\nOur success in the past has largely been attributable to our proprietary technology that has taken us many years to develop. We believe our proprietary technology has provided us with a competitive advantage relative to many FX market participants. If our competitors develop more advanced technologies, we may be required to devote substantial resources to the development of more advanced technology to remain competitive. The FX market is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changing trading systems, practices and techniques. We may not be able to keep up with these rapid changes in the future, develop new technology, realize a return on amounts invested in developing new technologies, and as such, may not remain competitive in the future.\nSystem failures could cause interruptions in our services or decreases in the responsiveness of our services, which could harm our business.\nIf our systems fail to perform, we could experience disruptions in operations, slower response times or decreased customer service and customer satisfaction. Our ability to facilitate transactions successfully and provide high quality customer service depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware and software systems. Our systems also are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events. We do not have fully redundant capabilities. While we currently maintain a disaster recovery plan (\u201cDRP\u201d), which is intended to minimize service interruptions and secure data integrity, our DRP may not work effectively during an emergency. Any system failure that causes an interruption in our services, decreases the responsiveness of our services or affects access to our services could impair our reputation, damage our brand name and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or may be prevented from using intellectual property necessary for our business.\nWe rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and fair business practice laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions to protect our proprietary technology, intellectual property rights and our brand. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants, and confidentiality agreements with other third parties. We also rigorously control access to our proprietary technology. It is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights. We may also face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to use technology that is material to our business operations.\nIn the future, we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and the attention of management, any of which could negatively affect our business.\nOur cost structure is largely fixed. If our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs, our profitability will be adversely affected.\nOur cost structure is largely fixed. We base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services, as well as our fixed operating infrastructure, such as computer hardware and software, hosting facilities and security and staffing levels. If demand for our products and services declines and, as a result, our revenues decline, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis and our profitability may be materially adversely affected.\nAttrition of customer accounts and failure to attract new accounts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. Even if we do attract new customers, we may fail to attract the customers in a cost-effective manner, which could materially adversely affect our profitability and growth.\nOur customer base is primarily comprised of individual retail customers. Although we offer products and tailored services designed to educate, support and retain our customers, our efforts to attract new customers or reduce the attrition rate\nof our existing customers may not be successful. If we are unable to maintain or increase our customer retention rates or generate a substantial number of new customers in a cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition, results of operations and comprehensive income and cash flows would likely be adversely affected. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred advertising and marketing expenses of $20.8 million from continuing operations. Although we have spent significant financial resources on advertising and marketing expenses, these efforts may not be a cost-effective way to attract new customers. We may be disadvantaged relative to our larger competitors in our ability to expand or maintain our advertising and marketing commitments, which may raise our customer acquisition costs. Additionally, our advertising and marketing methods are subject to regulation. The rules and regulations of various regulators impose specific limitations on our sales methods, advertising and marketing. If we do not achieve our advertising objectives, our profitability and growth may be materially adversely affected.\nWe face risks related to the events of January 15, 2015.\nOn January 15, 2015, our customers suffered significant losses and generated debit balances owed to us of approximately $275.1 million. This was due to the unprecedented and unexpected actions of the SNB, which caused extreme volatility in the EUR/CHF currency pair. As a result of customer debit balances following the historic movement of the Swiss Franc on January 15, 2015, certain of our regulators required those affected subsidiaries to supplement their respective net capital on an expedited basis. In order to achieve compliance with all regulatory capital requirements in all jurisdictions in which we operate, on January 16, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement with Leucadia that provided for a $300.0 million, two year term loan. See Note 19, \u201cLeucadia Transaction\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further detailed information regarding the transaction.\nAs a result of the events that took place on January 15, 2015, we already have been and may be subject to litigation by customers, stockholders, regulators or government agencies. While we are unable to predict the outcome of any existing or future litigation or future regulatory or governmental investigation, an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or ongoing operations.\nAdditionally, if our existing or potential future customers do not believe that we have satisfactorily addressed the issues related to the events of January 15, 2015, or if they have concerns about future issues, this could cause our existing or future customers to lose confidence in us which could adversely affect our reputation and ability to attract or maintain customers. In the event that we are not able to restore the confidence of our customers, we may experience reduced business activity and trading which could adversely impact the results of our operations.\nWe operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant compliance requirements and costs on us. Failure to comply with the rapidly evolving laws and regulations governing our FX and other businesses may result in regulatory agencies taking action against us and significant legal expenses in defending ourselves, which could adversely affect our revenues and the way we conduct our business.\nWe are regulated by governmental bodies and/or self-regulatory organizations in a number of jurisdictions, including the U.K. and Australia. We are also exposed to substantial risks of liability under federal and state securities laws, other federal and state laws and court decisions, as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, the Federal Reserve and state securities regulators.\nIn alignment with the rules set for in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (\u201cMiFID II\u201d) a number of European nations have initiated new restrictions. France has recently introduced a prohibition on electronic advertising to retail investors. In Italy, Consob has issued a notice recommending that retail OTC products should only be offered via a regulated market or an authorized multilateral trading facility. In Germany, Ba Fin has restricted the distribution, or sale of OTC products unless accompanied by a no debit guarantee so that the retail client cannot lose more than is deposited in his or her trading account.\nConcurrently, in the UK the FCA has proposed restrictions which will limit leverage in accordance with the experience of the retail customer.\nMany of the regulations we are governed by are intended to protect the public, our customers and the integrity of the markets, and not necessarily our shareholders. Substantially all of our operations involving the execution and clearing of transactions in foreign currencies, CFDs, gold and silver are conducted through subsidiaries that are regulated by governmental bodies or self-regulatory organizations. We are also regulated in all regions by applicable regulatory authorities and the various exchanges of which we are members. For example, we are regulated by the FCA and ASIC. In addition, certain of our branch offices in Europe, while subject to local regulators, are regulated by the FCA with respect to, among other things, FX, CFDs\nand net capital requirements. These regulators and self-regulatory organizations regulate the conduct of our business in many ways and conduct regular examinations of our business to monitor our compliance with these regulations. Among other things, we are subject to regulation with regard to:\n\u2022\nour sales practices, including our interaction with and solicitation of customers and our marketing activities;\n\u2022\nthe custody, control and safeguarding of our customers\u2019 assets;\n\u2022\naccount statements, record-keeping and retention;\n\u2022\nmaintaining specified minimum amounts of capital and limiting withdrawals of funds from our regulated operating subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nmaking regular financial and other reports to regulators;\n\u2022\nanti-money laundering practices;\n\u2022\nlicensing for our operating subsidiaries and our employees;\n\u2022\nthe conduct of our directors, officers, employees and affiliates; and\n\u2022\nsupervision of our business.\nCompliance with these regulations is complicated, time consuming and expensive. Even minor, inadvertent irregularities can potentially give rise to claims that applicable laws and regulations have been violated. Failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations could lead to fines and other penalties which could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to conduct our business as planned. In addition, we could incur significant legal expenses in defending ourselves against and resolving actions or investigations by such regulatory agencies.\nRecently, we entered into simultaneous regulatory settlements with each of the NFA and CFTC related to actions against each of Forex Capital Markets, LLC and Global Brokerage Holdings, LLC and certain of our principals. Pursuant to such settlement agreements, we withdrew from business within the U.S. There can be no guarantee our regulators in others parts of the world do not bring similar actions to those of the NFA and/or CFTC. Moreover, there can be no guarantee that any resolution to such potential actions does not require withdrawal from additional localities, markets, regions, or countries. Requirements to withdraw from business in any geographic region could adversely affect our reputation, revenue and profitability.\nWe accept customers from many jurisdictions in a manner which we believe does not require local registration, licensing or authorization. As a result, our growth may be limited by future restrictions in these jurisdictions, and we remain at risk that we may be exposed to civil or criminal penalties or be required to cease operations if we are found to be operating in jurisdictions without the proper license or authorization or if we become subject to regulation by local government bodies.\nTrading volume for 2016 with customers resident in jurisdictions in which we or our agents are not licensed or authorized by governmental bodies and/or self-regulatory organizations was, in the aggregate, approximately 52.3% of our total customer trading volume from continuing operations. We seek to deal with customers resident in foreign jurisdictions in a manner which does not breach any local laws or regulations where they are resident or require local registration, licensing or authorization from local governmental or regulatory bodies or self-regulatory organizations. We determine the nature and extent of services we can provide and the manner in which we conduct our business with customers resident in foreign jurisdictions based on a variety of factors.\nIn jurisdictions where we are not licensed or authorized, we are generally restricted from direct marketing to retail investors, including the operation of a website specifically targeted to investors in a particular foreign jurisdiction. This restriction may limit our ability to grow our business in such jurisdictions or may result in increased overhead costs or lower service quality to customers in such jurisdictions. Accordingly, we currently have only a limited presence in a number of significant markets and may not be able to gain a significant presence there unless and until legal and regulatory barriers to international firms in certain of those markets are modified. Existing and future legal and regulatory requirements and restrictions may adversely impact our international expansion on an ongoing basis and we may not be able to successfully develop our business in a number of markets, including emerging markets, as we currently plan.\nWe generally consult with local counsel in jurisdictions in which we are regulated and where, after conducting an internal risk assessment, we determine it may be necessary to receive advice from local counsel in order to appropriately comply with the local laws and regulations, new or otherwise, in these jurisdictions. We consult with local counsel in these jurisdictions for advice regarding whether we are operating in compliance with local laws and regulations (including whether\nwe are required to be licensed or authorized) or, in some cases where licensing or authorization requirements could be read to be applicable to foreign dealers without a local presence, whether such requirements are generally not enforced. In those jurisdictions in which we do not receive the advice of local counsel, we are accordingly exposed to the risk that we may be found to be operating in jurisdictions without required licenses or authorizations or without being in compliance with local legal or regulatory requirements. Furthermore, where we have taken legal advice, we are exposed to the risk that a local regulatory agency or other authority determines that our conduct is not in compliance with local laws or regulations (including local licensing or authorization requirements) and to the risk that the regulatory environment in a jurisdiction may change, including a circumstance where laws or regulations or licensing or authorization requirements that previously were not enforced become subject to enforcement.\nIn any of these circumstances, we may be subject to sanctions, fines and restrictions on our business or other civil or criminal penalties, and our contracts with customers may be void or unenforceable, which could lead to losses relating to restitution of client funds or principal risk on open positions. Any such action in one jurisdiction could also trigger similar actions in other jurisdictions. We may also be required to cease the conduct of our business with customers in any such jurisdiction and/or we may determine that compliance with the laws or licensing, authorization or other regulatory requirements for continuance of the business are too onerous to justify making the necessary changes to continue that business. In addition, any such event could impact our relationship with the regulators or self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions where we are subject to regulation, including our regulatory compliance or authorizations. If sanctions, fines, restrictions on our business or other penalties are imposed on us for failure to comply with applicable legal requirements, guidelines or regulations, our financial condition and results of operations, and our reputation and ability to engage in business, may be materially adversely affected.\nWe periodically evaluate our activities in relation to jurisdictions in which we are not currently regulated by governmental bodies and/or self-regulatory organizations on an ongoing basis. This evaluation may involve speaking with regulators, local counsel and referring brokers or white labels operating in any such jurisdiction and reviewing published regulatory guidance and examining the licenses that any competing firms may have. As a result of these evaluations we may determine to alter our business practices in order to comply with legal or regulatory developments in such jurisdictions and, at any given time, we are generally in various stages of updating our business practices in relation to various jurisdictions.\nPotential future changes in our business practices in certain jurisdictions could result in customers deciding to transact their business with a different FX broker, which may adversely affect our revenue and profitability. We may also be subject to enforcement actions and penalties by the regulatory authorities of those jurisdictions or be subject to customer claims.\nServicing customers via the internet may require us to comply with the laws and regulations of each country in which we are deemed to conduct business. Failure to comply with such laws may negatively impact our financial results.\nSince our services are available over the internet in foreign countries and we have customers residing in foreign countries, foreign jurisdictions may require us to qualify to do business in their country. We believe that the number of our customers residing outside of the U.S. will increase over time. We are required to comply with the laws and regulations of each country in which we conduct business, including laws and regulations currently in place or which may be enacted related to internet services available to their citizens from service providers located elsewhere. Any failure to develop effective compliance and reporting systems could result in regulatory penalties in the applicable jurisdiction, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nOur failure to comply with regulatory requirements could subject us to sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nMany of the laws and regulations by which we are governed grant regulators broad powers to investigate and enforce compliance with their rules and regulations and to impose penalties and other sanctions for non-compliance. Our ability to comply with all applicable laws and regulations is dependent in large part on our internal compliance function as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel, which we may not be able to do. If a regulator finds that we have failed to comply with applicable rules and regulations, we may be subject to censure, fines, cease-and-desist orders, suspension of our business, removal of personnel, civil litigation or other sanctions, including, in some cases, increased reporting requirements or other undertakings, revocation of our operating licenses or criminal conviction. Any disciplinary action taken against us could result in negative publicity, potential litigation, remediation costs and loss of customers which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nThe regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to continual change. Changes in the regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nThe legislative and regulatory environment in which we operate has undergone significant changes in the recent past and there may be future regulatory changes in our industry. The financial services industry in general has been subject to increasing regulatory oversight in recent years. The governmental bodies and self-regulatory organizations that regulate our business have proposed and may consider additional legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations. As a result, in the future, we may become subject to new regulations that may affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business less profitable. For example, a regulatory body may reduce the levels of leverage we are allowed to offer to our customers, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. Changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by those entities may also adversely affect our business.\nThe European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (\u201cEMIR\u201d) is the new European regulations on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories. The EMIR has completed the European legislative process and is being implemented across the EU member states. The EMIR imposes three new requirements on our European operations: (a) report derivatives to a trade repository (b) clear OTC derivatives that have been declared subject to the clearing obligation through a central counterparty and (c) put in place certain risk management procedures for OTC derivative transactions that are not cleared. Reporting requirements came into effect in February 2014. In addition to the EMIR, we expect the FCA will be enforcing MiFID II in 2018. Principle areas of impact related to this directive will involve organized trade facilities for trading non-equity products, investor protection, a requirement to supply clients with more information, and pre- and post-trade transparency around non-equity products.\nASIC is continuing the focus on retail OTC derivative providers, including margin foreign exchanges, and conducting increasing surveillance of this industry. The Australian government has also started the consultation process to tighten the client money protection regime, as part of a wider response to a financial system inquiry paper. Recently, the Australian government has enacted new restrictions aimed at increasing protections for retail OTC clients. Among other things, the new law prohibits the use of client money in hedging transactions or as collateral with counterparties in conjunction with OTC products which are not listed on a regulated exchange. Additionally, the new law empowers ASIC to adopt additional rules regarding the reporting and reconciliation of client money.\nThe Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (\u201cFATCA\u201d), enacted in 2010 as part of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act, imposes a system of information reporting and a 30% withholding tax on \"withholdable\" payments made by U.S. persons and others to foreign financial institutions (\u201cFFI\u201ds) and certain non-financial foreign entities (\u201cNFFE\u201ds) that do not meet the information reporting requirements of FATCA. In certain circumstances, certain of our non-U.S. entities through which payments are made may be required to withhold U.S. tax at a rate of 30% on all, or a portion of, payments made after June 30, 2014. Under FATCA, non-U.S. financial institutions generally will be required to enter into agreements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to identify financial accounts held by U.S. persons or entities with substantial U.S. ownership, as well as accounts of other financial institutions that are not themselves participating in, or otherwise exempt from, the FATCA reporting regime. Compliance with FATCA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and cash flow.\nThese and other future regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability and the FX industry as a whole.\nIn addition, the regulatory enforcement environment has created uncertainty with respect to certain practices or types of transactions that, in the past, were considered permissible and appropriate among financial services firms, but that later have been called into question or with respect to which additional regulatory requirements have been imposed. Legal or regulatory uncertainty and additional regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business.\nWe are required to maintain high levels of regulatory capital, which could constrain our growth and subject us to regulatory sanctions.\nRegulators maintain stringent rules requiring that we maintain specific minimum levels of regulatory capital in our operating subsidiaries that conduct our spot foreign exchange and CFDs, including contracts for gold, silver, oil and stock indices. As of December 31, 2016, on a separate company basis, we were required to maintain approximately $60.6 million of minimum net capital in the aggregate across all jurisdictions. Excluding the U.S. regulated entity, our minimum net capital requirement was approximately $27.3 million as of December 31, 2016. Regulators continue to evaluate and modify minimum\ncapital requirements from time to time in response to market events and to improve the stability of the international financial system.\nThe EU is in the process of implementing amendments to its Capital Requirements Directive (\u201cCRD IV\u201d), which seeks to strengthen its capital requirements and liquidity rules as well as expand certain reporting obligations. CRD IV legislation was entered into on January 1, 2014 and will gradually be implemented over a period until January 2019.\nEven if regulators do not change existing regulations or adopt new ones, our minimum capital requirements will generally increase in proportion to the size of our business conducted by our regulated subsidiaries. As a result, we will need to increase our regulatory capital in order to expand our operations and increase our revenue, and our inability to increase our capital on a cost-efficient basis could constrain our growth. In addition, in many cases, we are not permitted to withdraw regulatory capital maintained by our subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval or notice, which could constrain our ability to allocate our capital resources most efficiently throughout our global operations. In particular, these restrictions could limit our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions on our shares and, in some cases, could adversely affect our ability to withdraw funds needed to satisfy our ongoing operating expenses, debt service and other cash needs.\nRegulators monitor our levels of capital closely. We are required to report the amount of regulatory capital we maintain to our regulators on a periodic basis, and to report any deficiencies or material declines promptly. While we expect that our current amount of regulatory capital will be sufficient to meet anticipated short-term increases in requirements, any failure to maintain the required levels of regulatory capital, or to report any capital deficiencies or material declines in capital could result in severe sanctions, including fines, censure, restrictions on our ability to conduct business and revocation of our registrations. The imposition of one or more of these sanctions could ultimately lead to our liquidation, or the liquidation of one or more of our subsidiaries.\nProcedures and requirements of the Patriot Act and similar laws may expose us to significant costs or penalties.\nAs a financial services firm, we are subject to laws and regulations, including the Patriot Act, that require that we know our customers and monitor transactions for suspicious financial activities. The cost of complying with the Patriot Act and related laws and regulations is significant. We face the risk that our policies, procedures, technology and personnel directed toward complying with the Patriot Act and similar laws and regulations are insufficient and that we could be subject to significant criminal and civil penalties or reputational damage due to noncompliance. Such penalties and subsequent remediation costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to litigation risk which could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nMany aspects of our business involve risks that expose us to liability under U.S. federal and state laws, as well as the rules and enforcement efforts of our regulators and self-regulatory organizations worldwide. These risks include, among others, disputes over trade terms with customers and other market participants, customer losses resulting from system delay or failure and customer claims that we or our employees executed unauthorized transactions, made materially false or misleading statements or lost or diverted customer assets in our custody. We may also be subject to regulatory investigation and enforcement actions seeking to impose significant fines or other sanctions, which in turn could trigger civil litigation for our previous operations that may be deemed to have violated applicable rules and regulations in various jurisdictions.\nThe volume of claims and the amount of damages and fines claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services firms have been increasing, particularly in the current environment of heightened scrutiny of financial institutions. The amounts involved in the trades we execute, together with rapid price movements in our currency pairs, can result in potentially large damage claims in any litigation resulting from such trades. Dissatisfied customers may make claims against us regarding the quality of trade execution, improperly settled trades, mismanagement or even fraud, and these claims may increase as our business expands.\nLitigation may also arise from disputes over the exercise of our rights with respect to customer accounts. Although our customer agreements generally provide that we may exercise such rights with respect to customer accounts as we deem reasonably necessary for our protection, our exercise of these rights may lead to claims by customers that we did so improperly.\nEven if we prevail in any litigation or enforcement proceedings against us, we could incur significant legal expenses defending against the claims, even those without merit. Moreover, because even claims without merit can damage our\nreputation or raise concerns among our customers, we may feel compelled to settle claims at significant cost. The initiation of any claim, proceeding or investigation against us, or an adverse resolution of any such matter could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nPlease see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of pending material legal proceedings we are currently involved in.\nWe may be subject to customer litigation, financial losses, regulatory sanctions and harm to our reputation as a result of employee misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter.\nThere have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years. Our employees could execute unauthorized transactions for our customers, use customer assets improperly or without authorization, carry out improper activities on behalf of customers or use confidential customer or company information for personal or other improper purposes, as well as misrecord or otherwise try to hide improper activities from us.\nIn addition, employee errors, including mistakes in executing, recording or reporting transactions for customers, may cause us to enter into transactions that customers disavow and refuse to settle. Employee errors expose us to the risk of material losses until the errors are detected and the transactions are reversed. The risk of employee error or miscommunication may be greater for products that are new or have non-standardized terms. Further, such errors may be more likely to occur in the aftermath of any acquisitions during the integration of or migration from technological systems.\nMisconduct by our employees or former employees could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. It may not be possible to deter or detect employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Our employees may also commit good faith errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence or otherwise, as well as regulatory actions.\nMisconduct by employees of our customers can also expose us to claims for financial losses or regulatory proceedings when it is alleged we or our employees knew or should have known that an employee of our customer was not authorized to undertake certain transactions. Dissatisfied customers can make claims against us, including claims for negligence, fraud, unauthorized trading, failure to supervise, breach of fiduciary duty, employee errors, intentional misconduct, unauthorized transactions by associated persons and failures in the processing of transactions.\nOur customer accounts may be vulnerable to identity theft and credit card fraud.\nCredit card issuers have adopted credit card security guidelines as part of their ongoing efforts to prevent identity theft and credit card fraud. We continue to work with credit card issuers to ensure that our services, including customer account maintenance, comply with these rules. There can be no assurances, however, that our services are fully protected from unauthorized access or hacking. If there is unauthorized access to credit card data that results in financial loss, we may experience reputational damage and parties could seek damages from us.\nA breach in the security of our systems could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for us.\nAlthough we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to us and our customers and clients, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security. We and other companies have reported significant breaches in the security of websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, including through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means.\nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties such as persons who are associated with external service providers or who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments.\nThose parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our systems could cause serious negative consequences for us, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of confidential information belonging to us or to our customers, or damage to our computers or systems and those of our customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, these risks have grown in recent years due to increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties.\nIn the current environment facing financial services firms, a firm\u2019s reputation is critically important. If our reputation is harmed, or the reputation of the online financial services industry as a whole or retail FX industry is harmed, our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers and employees may be adversely affected if our reputation is damaged. If we fail, or appear to fail, to deal with issues that may give rise to reputation risk, we could harm our business prospects. These issues include, but are not limited to, issues related to and as a result of the events of January 15, 2015, issues related to our settlements with the CFTC and NFA, including our withdrawal from doing business in the U.S., appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest, legal and regulatory requirements, ethical issues, money-laundering, privacy, customer data protection, record-keeping, sales and trading practices, and the proper identification of the legal, credit, liquidity, operational and market risks inherent in our business. Failure to appropriately address these issues could also give rise to additional legal risk to us, which could, in turn, increase the size and number of claims and damages asserted against us or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, fines and penalties. Any such sanction would materially adversely affect our reputation, thereby reducing our ability to attract and retain customers and employees.\nIn addition, our ability to attract and retain customers may be adversely affected if the reputation of the online financial services industry as a whole or retail FX industry is damaged. In recent years, a number of financial services firms have suffered significant damage to their reputations from highly publicized incidents that in turn resulted in significant and in some cases irreparable harm to their business. The perception of instability within the online financial services industry or of our company due to the events of January 15, 2015, could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers.\nRecently, we entered into simultaneous regulatory settlements with each of the NFA and CFTC related to actions against each of Forex Capital Markets, LLC and Global Brokerage Holdings, LLC, and certain of our principals. The NFA and CFTC made certain allegations and findings within each of their respective settlement orders. Pursuant to such settlement agreements, we withdrew from business within the U.S. We could sustain reputational damage due to such withdrawal from the U.S. market and the allegations and findings made by the NFA and CFTC.\nThe loss of members of our senior management could compromise our ability to effectively manage our business and pursue our growth strategy.\nWe rely on members of our senior management to execute our existing business plans and to identify and pursue new opportunities. Certain members of our management team have been with us for most of our history and have significant experience in the FX industry. Our continued success is dependent upon the retention of these and other key executive officers and employees, as well as the services provided by our trading staff, technology and programming specialists and a number of other key managerial, marketing, planning, financial, technical and operations personnel. The loss of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our ability to grow our business is dependent, to a large degree, on our ability to retain such employees.\nAny new acquisitions or joint ventures that we may pursue may adversely affect our business and could present unforeseen integration obstacles.\nWe have completed several significant acquisitions since our inception. We may pursue new acquisitions or joint ventures that could present integration obstacles or costs. The process of integrating the operations of any acquired business with ours may require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention. Any substantial diversion of management attention or difficulties in operating any of the combined business could affect our ability to achieve operational, financial and strategic objectives. The unsuccessful integration of any of the operations of any acquired business with ours may also have adverse short-term effects on reported operating results and may lead to the loss of key personnel. In addition,\ncustomers from any acquired business may react unfavorably to the combination of our businesses or we may be exposed to additional liabilities of any acquired business, both of which could materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. In addition, future acquisitions or joint ventures may involve the issuance of additional limited liability company interests in Holdings (\u201cHoldings Units\u201d), or shares of our Class A common stock, which would dilute ownership.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor example, we have expanded trading in CFDs and spread betting. We face the same risks with these products that we face in our FX trading business, including market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity risk, technology risk, third party risk and risk of human error. Furthermore, the volatility of the CFD and spread betting markets may have an adverse impact on our ability to maintain profit margins similar to the profit margins we have realized with respect to FX trading. The introduction of these and other potential financial products also poses a risk that our risk management policies, procedures and practices, and the technology that supports such activities, will be unable to effectively manage these new risks to our business. In addition, these offerings may be subject to regulation under applicable securities or other consumer protection laws. Our non-U.S. subsidiaries, UK LTD (which is licensed with the FCA in the U.K.) and FXCM Australia Limited (\"Australia\") (which is licensed with the ASIC) offer and sell CFDs outside the U.S. in compliance with applicable local regulatory requirements. CFDs are not and may not be offered in the U.S. In the event that an offer or sale of CFDs by our non-U.S. subsidiaries was to constitute an offer or sale of securities subject to the U.S. federal securities laws or swaps, futures, forwards or other instruments over which the CFTC has, or under the Dodd-Frank Act, will have jurisdiction, we would be required to comply with such U.S. laws with respect to such offering. In that event, we may determine that it would be too onerous or otherwise not feasible for us to continue such offers or sales of CFDs. We currently derive approximately 39.2% of our trading revenues from continuing operations from our CFD business.\nLucid and V3 Markets, LLC subject us to a variety of additional risks.\nIn June 2012, we acquired a 50.1% controlling interest in Lucid. In January 2014, we created a new entity with the principals of Lucid, V3, in which we also maintain a 50.1% controlling interest. V3 contains the assets purchased from Infinium Capital Holdings LLC (\u201cInfinium Capital\u201d) and certain of Infinium Capital\u2019s affiliates.\nLucid and V3 may expose us to a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022\nSignificant fluctuations in our revenues and profitability from period to period;\n\u2022\nRisk of trading losses;\n\u2022\nSystem failures and delays;\n\u2022\nCompetition from new competitors; and\n\u2022\nOur failure to implement and apply risk management controls and procedures.\nLucid\u2019s and V3\u2019s revenues and operating results vary significantly from period to period, whether due to movements and trends in the underlying markets, to competitors who are willing to trade more aggressively by decreasing their bid/offer spreads and thereby assuming more risk in order to acquire market share, to fluctuations in trading levels or otherwise. As a result, our revenues and profitability may be subject to significant fluctuations or declines. Lucid and V3 are recorded as held for sale on our consolidated statements of financial condition and the operating results of Lucid and V3 are included in the results from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations.\nAs a market maker, Lucid provides liquidity by buying from sellers and selling to buyers. Lucid may accumulate significant positions preceding unfavorable price movements in currencies, creating the potential for trading losses. Should these events occur or increase in frequency or magnitude, we could experience material losses.\nThe business activities of Lucid and V3 are heavily dependent on the integrity and performance of the computer and communications systems supporting them and the services of certain third parties. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, technological or operational failures, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorism and other similar events. The nature of Lucid\u2019s and V3\u2019s businesses involves a high volume of transactions made in rapid fashion which could result in certain errors being repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Extraordinary trading volumes or other events could cause Lucid\u2019s or V3\u2019s computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail. Lucid\u2019s and V3\u2019s necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and large transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.\nLucid and V3 have expanded our market making and trading activities into options on selected exchange traded futures and over-the-counter FX. V3 may be exposed to additional risk due to incorrect recording and valuation of inventory as well as market events which impact large and/or illiquid positions. All of the risks that pertain to our FX business also apply to these products, and despite the measures taken to strengthen the risk oversight of V3, we have less experience in these markets and despite a slow and thoughtful expansion, unforeseen events may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nAs a result of the business of Lucid and V3, we have additional competitors. Our competitors include sophisticated institutions which have larger customer bases, more established name recognition and substantially greater financial, marketing, technological and personnel resources than we do. These competitors, including commercial and investment banking firms, may have access to capital in greater amounts and at lower costs than we do, and therefore, may be better able to respond and to compete for market share generally. Additionally, our competitors may have better trading algorithms or faster connections which can affect profitability. We may not be able to compete effectively against these firms, particularly those with greater financial resources, and our failure to do so could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nLucid and V3 are dependent on risk management policies and the adherence to such policies by trading staff. Policies, procedures and practices are used to identify, monitor and control a variety of risks, including market risk and risks related to human error, customer defaults, market movements, fraud and money-laundering. Some of our methods for managing risk are discretionary by nature and are based on internally developed controls and observed historical market behavior, and also involve reliance on standard industry practices. The trading activities of Lucid and V3 as principals subject us to this risk and we may need to continually implement and apply new risk management controls and procedures. We may not successfully implement and apply risk management policies and procedures that will identify, monitor and control the risks associated with principal trading.\nWe have expanded our principal model offered to smaller retail clients, which will expose us to additional risks, including the risk of material trading losses.\nWe have expanded our principal model offered to smaller retail clients. In our agency model, when a customer executes a trade with us, we act as a credit intermediary, or riskless principal, simultaneously entering into trades with the customer and the FX market maker. In the principal model, however, we may maintain our trading position if we believe the price may move in our favor and against the customer and not offset the trade with another party. As a result, we may incur trading losses using principal model execution for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nPrice changes in currencies;\n\u2022\nLack of liquidity in currencies in which we have positions; and\n\u2022\nInaccuracies in our proprietary pricing mechanism, or rate engine, which evaluates, monitors and assimilates market data and reevaluates our outstanding currency quotes and is designed to publish prices reflective of prevailing market conditions throughout the trading day.\nThese risks may affect the prices at which we are able to sell or buy currencies, or may limit or restrict our ability to either resell currencies that we have purchased or repurchase currencies that we have sold. In addition, competitive forces may\nrequire us to match the breadth of quotes our competitors display and to hold varying amounts and types of currencies at any given time. By having to maintain positions in certain currencies, we may be subject to a high degree of market risk. We may not be able to successfully implement and apply risk management policies and procedures that address the risks associated with principal model execution and may otherwise fail to manage such risks successfully. Accordingly, we could experience significant losses from such activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the revenues we expect to record from our principal model broker activities consists primarily of trading gains and losses, and are more affected by market volatility. Finally, as we have for a number of years conducted our retail operations on the basis of the agency model, we could suffer reputational damage and additional regulatory scrutiny by offering execution to retail clients that creates an inherent conflict between the interests of the customer and our interests.\nWe may be unable to effectively manage our growth and retain our customers.\nThe growth of our business during our short history has placed significant demands on our management and other resources. If our business continues to grow at a rate consistent with our historical growth, we may need to expand and upgrade the reliability and scalability of our transaction processing systems, network infrastructure and other aspects of our proprietary technology. We may not be able to expand and upgrade our technology systems and infrastructure to accommodate such increases in our business activity in a timely manner, which could lead to operational breakdowns and delays, loss of customers, a reduction in the growth of our customer base, increased operating expenses, financial losses, increased litigation or customer claims, regulatory sanctions or increased regulatory scrutiny.\nWe may be unable to respond to customers\u2019 demands for new services and products and our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards. New services and products provided by our competitors may render our existing services and products less competitive. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to respond to customers\u2019 demands for new services and products on a timely and cost-effective basis and to adapt to address the increasingly sophisticated requirements and varied needs of our customers and prospective customers. We may not be successful in developing, introducing or marketing new services and products. In addition, our new service and product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance. Any failure on our part to anticipate or respond adequately to customer requirements or changing industry practices, or any significant delays in the development, introduction or availability of new services, products or service or product enhancements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face significant competition. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have larger customer bases, more established brand recognition and greater financial, marketing, technological and personnel resources than we do, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Additionally, some of our competitors and many potential competitors are better capitalized than we are and able to obtain capital more easily, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe compete in the FX market based on our ability to execute our customers\u2019 trades at competitive prices, to retain our existing customers and to attract new customers. Certain of our competitors have larger customer bases, more established name recognition, a greater market share in certain markets, such as Europe, and greater financial, marketing, technological and personnel resources than we do. These advantages may enable them, among other things, to:\n\u2022\ndevelop products and services that are similar to ours, or that are more attractive to customers than ours, in one or more of our markets;\n\u2022\nprovide products and services we do not offer;\n\u2022\nprovide execution and clearing services that are more rapid, reliable or efficient, or less expensive than ours;\n\u2022\noffer products and services at prices below ours to gain market share and to promote other businesses, such as FX options listed securities, CFDs, including contracts for precious metals, energy and stock indices, and OTC derivatives;\n\u2022\nadapt at a faster rate to market conditions, new technologies and customer demands;\n\u2022\noffer better, faster and more reliable technology;\n\u2022\noutbid us for desirable acquisition targets;\n\u2022\nmore efficiently engage in and expand existing relationships with strategic alliances;\n\u2022\nmarket, promote and sell their products and services more effectively; and\n\u2022\ndevelop stronger relationships with customers.\nThese larger and better capitalized competitors, including commercial and investment banking firms, may have access to capital in greater amounts and at lower costs than we do and thus, may be better able to respond to changes in the FX industry, to compete for skilled professionals, to finance acquisitions, to fund internal growth and to compete for market share generally. Access to capital is critical to our business to satisfy regulatory obligations and liquidity requirements. Among other things, access to capital determines our creditworthiness, which if perceived negatively in the market could materially impair our ability to provide clearing services and attract customer assets, both of which are important sources of revenue. Access to capital also determines the degree to which we can expand our operations. Thus, if we are unable to maintain or increase our capital on competitive terms, we could be at a significant competitive disadvantage, and our ability to maintain or increase our revenue and earnings could be materially impaired. Also, new or existing competitors in our markets could make it difficult for us to maintain our current market share or increase it in desirable markets. In addition, our competitors could offer their services at lower prices, and we may be required to reduce our fees significantly to remain competitive. A fee reduction without a commensurate reduction in expenses would decrease our profitability. We may not be able to compete effectively against these firms, particularly those with greater financial resources, and our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. We may in the future face increased competition, resulting in narrowing bid/offer spreads which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to effectively compete in emerging international markets, either directly or through joint ventures with local firms, the future growth of our business may be adversely affected.\nWe regard emerging international markets as an important area of our future growth. Due to cultural, regulatory and other factors relevant to those markets, however, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in those regions relative to local firms or to international firms that have a well-established local presence. In some regions, we may need to enter into joint ventures with local firms in order to establish a presence in the local market, and we may face intense competition from other international firms over relatively scarce opportunities for market entry. Given the intense competition from other international firms that are also seeking to enter these fast-growing markets, we may have difficulty finding suitable local firms willing to enter into the types of relationships with us that we may need to gain access to these markets. This competition could make it difficult for us to expand our business internationally as planned. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated approximately 81.8% of our customer trading volume from customers outside the U.S. Expanding our business in emerging markets is an important part of our growth strategy. We face significant risks in doing business in international markets, particularly in developing regions. These business, legal and tax risks include:\n\u2022\nless developed or mature local technological infrastructure and higher costs, which could make our products and services less attractive or accessible in emerging markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in complying with the diverse regulatory requirements of multiple jurisdictions, which may be more burdensome, not clearly defined, and subject to unexpected changes, potentially exposing us to significant compliance costs and regulatory penalties;\n\u2022\nless developed and established local financial and banking infrastructure, which could make our products and services less accessible in emerging markets;\n\u2022\nreduced protection of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ninability to enforce contracts in some jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations, including reliance on newly hired local personnel;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\ncurrency and tax laws that may prevent or restrict the transfer of capital and profits among our various operations around the world; and\n\u2022\ntime zone, language and cultural differences among personnel in different areas of the world.\nIn addition, in order to be competitive in these local markets, or in some cases because of restrictions on the ability of foreign firms to conduct business locally, we may seek to operate through joint ventures with local firms. Doing business\nthrough joint ventures may limit our ability to control the conduct of the business and could expose us to reputational and greater operational risks.\nOur business could be adversely affected if global economic conditions continue to negatively impact our customer base.\nOur customer base is primarily comprised of individual retail customers who view foreign currency trading as an alternative investment class. If global economic conditions continue to negatively impact the FX market or adverse developments in global economic conditions continue to limit the disposable income of our customers, our business could be materially adversely affected as our customers may choose to curtail their trading in the FX market which could result in reduced customer trading volume and trading revenue.\nWe face risks related to the passage of the recent \"Brexit\" referendum in the United Kingdom which could harm our business and operations.\nFollowing the U.K.\u2019s adoption of the policy passed in its recent vote to leave the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d), (the \u201cBrexit\u201d), we will likely face new regulatory and legal costs and challenges. The key mechanism for the cross-border provision of financial services within the E.U. is the passport under the E.U. single market directive. Our U.K. operations may no longer be able to take advantage of passporting financial services from the U.K. to other E.U. member states. In addition, the equivalence of the U.K.\u2019s regulatory regime in terms of governance could also become uncertain. This may affect the way in which our operating companies in the U.K. manage their businesses.\nDepending on the terms of Brexit, the U.K. could also lose access to the single E.U. market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the E.U. on behalf of its members. Such a decline in trade could affect the attractiveness of the U.K. as a global investment center and, as a result, could have a detrimental impact on U.K. growth. The uncertainty prior to the actual implementation of Brexit could also have a negative impact on the U.K. economy. Although we have an international customer base, we could be adversely affected by reduced growth and greater volatility in the U.K. economy.\nChanges to U.K. and E.U. migration policy could likewise occur as a result of Brexit. London\u2019s role as a global center for business may decline, particularly if financial services entities shift their headquarters to the E.U. impacting our ability to recruit and retain talent. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of domestic and foreign tax laws and regulations that are constantly changing.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of domestic and foreign tax laws and regulations that are constantly changing. We are affected by new laws and regulations, and changes to existing laws and regulations, including interpretations by courts and regulators. With the finalization of specific actions contained within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (the \u201cOECD\u201d) Base Erosion and Profit study (\u201cBEPS\u201d), many OECD countries have acknowledged their intent to implement BEPS and update their local tax regulations. The extent (if any) to which countries in which we operate adopt and implement BEPS could affect our effective tax rate and our future results from non-U.S. operations.\nA systemic market event that impacts the various market participants with whom we interact could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nWe interact with various third parties through our relationships with our prime brokers, white labels and referring brokers. Some of these market participants could be overleveraged. In the event of sudden, large market price movements, such as the events of January 15, 2015, market participants may not be able to meet their obligations to brokers who, in turn, may not be able to meet their obligations to their counterparties. As a result, if a systemic collapse in the financial system were to occur, defaults by one or more counterparties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nThe decline in short-term interest rates has had an adverse effect on our interest income and revenues.\nA portion of our revenue is derived from interest income. We earn interest on customer balances held in customer accounts and on our cash held in deposit accounts at various financial institutions. As a result of the decline in short-term interest rates, our interest income has declined significantly. Short-term interest rates are highly sensitive to factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. Our interest income from continuing operations was approximately $2.5 million and $1.8 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest income may not return to the amount we reported in prior years, and any further deterioration in short-term interest rates could further adversely affect our interest income and revenue.\nIn addition, this decline in interest rates has narrowed cross-border interest rate differentials, which has adversely affected the \u201ccarry trade,\u201d a once popular investing strategy which involves buying a currency that offers a higher interest rate while selling a currency that offers a lower interest rate. We believe the decline in the carry trade has resulted in a decrease in retail FX volume. Accordingly, our growth could be impeded if cross-border interest rate differentials remain compressed.\nOur operations in certain developing regions may be subject to the risks associated with politically unstable and less economically developed regions of the world. Trading in the currencies of these developing regions may expose our customers and the third parties with whom we interact to sudden and significant financial loss as a result of exceptionally volatile and unpredictable price movements and could negatively impact our business.\nOur operations in some emerging markets may be subject to the political, legal and economic risks associated with politically unstable and less economically developed regions of the world, including the risks of war, insurgency, terrorism and government appropriation. For example, we do business in countries whose currencies may be less stable than those in our primary markets. Currency instability, government imposition of currency restrictions or capital controls in these countries could impede our operations in the FX markets in these countries. In addition, emerging markets may be subject to exceptionally volatile and unpredictable price movements that can expose customers and brokers to sudden and significant financial loss. Trading in these markets may be less liquid, market participants may be less well capitalized and market oversight may be less extensive, all of which could increase trading risk, particularly in markets for derivatives, commodities and currencies. Substantial trading losses by customers or customer or counterparty defaults, or the prospect of them, in turn, could drive down trading volume in these markets.\nWe are dependent on FX market makers to continually provide us with FX market liquidity. In the event we lose access to current prices and liquidity levels, we may be unable to provide competitive FX trading services, which will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on third party financial institutions to provide us with FX market liquidity. These FX market makers, although under contract with us, have no obligation to provide us with liquidity and may terminate our arrangements at any time. We also rely upon these FX market makers to provide us with competitive FX pricing which we can pass on to our customers. In the event we lose access to the competitive FX pricing and/or liquidity levels that we currently have, as occurred on January 15, 2015 and more recently as a result of the regulatory settlements reached with the CFTC and the NFA, we may be unable to provide competitive FX trading services, which will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. When we act as a riskless principal between our customers and our FX market makers, we provide our customers with the best bid and offer price for each currency pair from our FX market makers. When a customer places a trade and opens a position, we act as the counterparty to that trade and our system immediately opens a trade between us and the FX market maker who provided the price that the customer selected. In the event that an offsetting trade fails, we could incur losses resulting from our trade with our customer.\nIn addition, whether as a result of exceptional volatility or situations affecting the market, the absence of competitive pricing from FX market makers and/or the suspension of liquidity would expose us to the risk of a default by the customer and consequently, trading losses. Although our margining practices are designed to mitigate this risk, we may be unable to close out customer positions at a level where margin posted by the customer is sufficient to cover the customer\u2019s losses. As a result, a customer may suffer losses greater than any margin or other funds or assets posted by that customer or held by us on behalf of that customer.\nWe are subject to risk of default by financial institutions that hold our funds and our customers\u2019 funds.\nWe have significant deposits with banks and other financial institutions. As of December 31, 2016, 30 financial institutions held our funds and our customer funds of $872.2 million, including $9.4 million classified within assets held for sale. Three financial institutions, including Barclays, Citibank and Bank of America, held, in aggregate, approximately 38.2% of the total of our funds and our customer funds. We aggregate our customers\u2019 funds and our funds and hold them in collateral and deposit accounts at various financial institutions. In the event of insolvency of one or more of the financial institutions with whom we have deposited these funds, both we and our customers may not be able to recover our funds. If any of such financial institutions becomes insolvent, a significant portion of our funds and our customer funds may not be recovered. In such an event, our business and cash flow would be materially adversely impacted. Because our customers\u2019 funds are aggregated with our own, they are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other similar insurer domestically or abroad,\nexcept to the extent of the maximum insured amount per deposit, which is unlikely to provide significant benefits to our customers. In any such insolvency, we and our customers would rank as unsecured creditors in respect of claims to funds deposited with any such financial institution. As a result, we may be subject to claims by customers due to the loss of customer funds and our business would be harmed by the loss of our own funds.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk whereby defaults by parties with whom we do business can have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nOur FX trading operations require a commitment of capital and involve risk of losses due to the potential failure of our customers to perform their obligations under these transactions. All retail customers are required to deposit cash collateral in order to trade on our retail platforms.\nCertain institutional customers that use our retail trading platforms are not required to deposit cash collateral in order to trade on our retail platforms. In rare circumstances, we provide short term credit directly to certain institutional customers when initial collateral does not cover risk exposure.\nMost of the institutional customers that use our institutional trading platforms trade via credits and limits set by the customers\u2019 prime brokers and by our prime brokers. As part of our arrangement with our prime brokers, they incur the credit risk regarding the trading of our institutional customers. We also, in certain situations, act in the capacity of a prime broker to a select number of institutional customers that use our institutional trading platform.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have extended a minimal amount of credit to institutional customers that use our trading platforms. We have had no significant losses due to failure to repay amounts credited to those certain institutional customers.\nWe are also subject to counterparty risk with respect to clearing and prime brokers as well as banks with respect to our own deposits and deposits of customer funds. We are exposed to credit risk in the event that such counterparties fail to fulfill their obligations. Although we seek to manage the credit risk arising from institutional counterparties by setting exposure limits and monitoring exposure against such limits, carrying out periodic credit reviews, and spreading credit risk across a number of different institutions to diversify risk, if our credit and counterparty risk management processes are inadequate we could face significant liabilities which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on the services of prime brokers to assist in providing us access to liquidity through our FX market makers. The loss of one or more of our prime brokerage relationships could lead to increased transaction costs and capital posting requirements, as well as having a negative impact on our ability to verify our open positions, collateral balances and trade confirmations.\nWe depend on the services of prime brokers to assist in providing us access to liquidity through our FX market makers. We currently have prime brokerage relationships which act as central hubs through which we are able to deal with our FX market makers. In return for paying a transaction-based prime brokerage fee, we are able to aggregate our trading exposures, thereby reducing our transaction costs. Since we trade with our FX market makers through our prime brokers, they also serve as a third party check on our open positions, collateral balances and trade confirmations. If we were to lose one or more of our prime brokerage relationships, we could lose this source of third party verification of our trading activity, which could lead to an increased number of record-keeping or documentation errors. Although we have relationships with FX market makers who could provide clearing services as a back-up for our prime brokerage services, if we were to experience a disruption in prime brokerage services due to a financial, technical, regulatory or other development adversely affecting any of our current prime brokers, our business could be materially adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to transfer positions and margin balances to another financial institution in a timely fashion. In the event of the insolvency of a prime broker, we might not be able to fully recover the assets we have deposited (and have deposited on behalf of our customers) with the prime broker or our unrealized profits since we will be among the prime broker\u2019s unsecured creditors.\nFailure of third-party systems or third-party service and software providers upon which we rely could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on certain third party computer systems or third party service and software providers, including technology platforms, back-office systems, internet service providers and communications facilities. Any interruption in these third party services, or deterioration in their performance or quality, could adversely affect our business. If our arrangement with any third party is terminated, we may not be able to find an alternative systems or services provider on a timely basis or on commercially\nreasonable terms. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nOur computer infrastructure may be vulnerable to security breaches. Any such problems could jeopardize confidential information transmitted over the internet, cause interruptions in our operations or give rise to liabilities to third parties.\nOur computer infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic computer break-ins, viruses and similar disruptive problems and security breaches. Any such problems or security breaches could give rise to liabilities to one or more third parties, including our customers, and disrupt our operations. A party able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or customer information, jeopardize the confidential nature of information we transmit over the internet or cause interruptions in our operations. Concerns over the security of internet transactions and the safeguarding of confidential personal information could also inhibit the use of our systems to conduct FX transactions over the internet. To the extent that our activities involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and personal financial information, security breaches could expose us to a risk of financial loss, litigation and other liabilities. Our current insurance policies may not protect us against all of such losses and liabilities. Any of these events, particularly if they result in a loss of confidence in our services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have relationships with referring brokers who direct new customers to us. Failure to maintain these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have relationships with referring brokers who direct new customers to us and provide marketing and other services for these customers. Many of our relationships with referring brokers are non-exclusive or may be terminated by the brokers on short notice. In addition, under our agreements with referring brokers, they have no obligation to provide us with new customers or minimum levels of transaction volume. Our failure to maintain our relationships with these referring brokers, the failure of the referring brokers to provide us with customers or our failure to create new relationships with referring brokers would result in a loss of revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. To the extent any of our competitors offer more attractive compensation terms to one of our referring brokers, we could lose the broker\u2019s services or be required to increase the compensation we pay to retain the broker. In addition, we may agree to set the compensation for one or more referring brokers at a level where, based on the transaction volume generated by customers directed to us by such brokers, it would have been more economically attractive to seek to acquire the customers directly rather than through the referring broker. To the extent we do not enter into economically attractive relationships with referring brokers, our referring brokers terminate their relationship with us or our referring brokers fail to provide us with customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur relationships with our referring brokers may also expose us to significant reputational and legal risks as we could be harmed by referring broker misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter.\nOur reputation may be harmed by, or we may be liable for, improper conduct by our referring brokers, even though we do not control their activities. Referring brokers maintain customer relationships and delegate to us the responsibilities associated with FX and back-office operations. Furthermore, many of our referring brokers operate websites, which they use to advertise our services or direct customers to us. It is difficult for us to closely monitor the contents of their websites to ensure that the statements they make in relation to our services are accurate and comply with applicable rules and regulations.\nWe have relationships with white labels who direct customer trading volume to us. Failure to maintain these relationships or develop new white label relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have relationships with white labels that provide FX trading to their customers by using our technology platform and other services and therefore provide us with an additional source of revenue. In certain jurisdictions, we are only able to provide our services through white label relationships. Many of our relationships with white labels are non-exclusive or may be terminated by them on short notice. In addition, our white labels have no obligation to provide us with minimum levels of transaction volume. Our failure to maintain our relationships with these white labels, the failure of these white labels to continue to offer online FX trading services to their customers using our technology platform, the loss of requisite licenses by our white labels or our inability to enter into new relationships with white labels would result in a loss of revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. To the extent any of\nour competitors offer more attractive compensation terms to one or more of our white labels, we could lose the white label relationship or be required to increase the compensation we pay to retain the white label.\nWhite labels with whom we have relationships accept customers from many jurisdictions and are therefore subject to regulations in a number of jurisdictions. If such regulations, or changes in such regulations, increase the white labels\u2019 overhead costs, including compliance costs and legal fees and expenses, limit their ability to engage or grow their business and increase their market share or result in sanctions and fines, their business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. This could reduce the volume of customer trading that such white labels direct to us, which would, in turn, adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our relationships with our white labels also may expose us to significant regulatory, reputational and other risks as we could be harmed by white label misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter. If any of our white labels provided unsatisfactory service to their customers or are deemed to have failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations, our reputation may be harmed or we may be subject to claims as a result of our association with such white label. Any such harm to our reputation or liability would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nWe have significant leverage.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we owe $154.5 million aggregate principal to Leucadia and have $172.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% convertible senior notes due 2018 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) outstanding. This leverage may have important negative consequences for us and our stockholders, including:\n\u2022\nIncreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nRequiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nMaking it difficult for us to optically manage the cash flow for our business;\n\u2022\nLimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022\nPlacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nSubjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends and distributions, make acquisitions and dispositions, borrow additional funds, and make capital expenditures and other investments.\nOur ability to pay down our indebtedness will depend on our future performance, our ability to generate cash flow and market conditions, each of which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt. We also may decide to sell certain assets to pay down our debt. There are no assurances that we will be able to sell such assets on desirable terms which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nThe credit agreement we entered into with Leucadia is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and is secured by a pledge of certain equity interests of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries. The credit agreement also contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions, and it could therefore limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe credit agreement we entered into with Leucadia contains a number of restrictive covenants relating to limitations on liens, investments, restricted payments, fundamental changes, dispositions, the incurrence of indebtedness, and transactions with affiliates. The credit agreement contains customary events of default, including, among others, non-payments of principal and interest; breach of representations and warranties; failure to maintain compliance with covenants contained in the credit agreement; the existence of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; insolvency; and a change of control.\nFailure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic conditions. These covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests. Failure to comply with any of the covenants under the credit agreement could result in a default. An event of default (including a cross-default under the Convertible Notes or other financing facilities) would permit our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If\nLeucadia accelerates the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our debt or it would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. See Note 19, \u201cLeucadia Transaction\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further information on our credit agreement.\nWe may not have the ability to repay the Convertible Notes when they mature in June 2018 or the bi-annual interest payments on the Convertible Notes.\nThe Convertible Notes mature on June 15, 2018. At that time, we will be obligated to repay the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at that time to meet our repayment obligations. We expect that our principal source of cash flow will be distributions by Group to Global Brokerage, Inc. However, our agreements with Leucadia govern the distributions of cash by Group to Leucadia and Global Brokerage, Inc., and these provisions severely restrict the amount of cash that Group is permitted to distribute to Global Brokerage, Inc. to make payments of principal and interest on the Convertible Notes. Without access to sufficient cash from Group to repay the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes, we may default on our repayment obligations under the Convertible Notes. The agreements with Leucadia also provide that we meet a specified minimum fixed charge coverage ratio prior to making the bi-annual interest payments due under the Convertible Notes. If we are unable to satisfy such minimum fixed charge coverage, we could default on our interest payment obligation under the Convertible Notes. A default could also lead to a default under other agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness. Any such default would have a material adverse effect on the equity value of our business and, therefore, the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes or to purchase the Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or to purchase the Convertible Notes.\nUpon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Convertible Notes), subject to certain conditions, holders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to purchase their Convertible Notes for cash at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, we will be required to make cash payments of up to $1,000 for each $1,000 in principal amount of Convertible Notes converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make purchases of Convertible Notes surrendered for purchase upon a fundamental change or to make cash payments in respect of Convertible Notes that are being converted. In addition, our ability to purchase the Convertible Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Convertible Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to purchase Convertible Notes at a time when the purchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on conversions of the Convertible Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under other agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the Convertible Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nFuture issuances of our Class A common stock may adversely affect our stock price.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock from the Convertible Notes, or the perception by the market that those sales could occur, could cause the trading price of the notes and the market price of our Class A common stock to decline or could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through the sale of equity in the future. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock is reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, for equity grants pursuant to our equity compensation plans and for potential exchanges of Holdings Units for shares of Class A common stock. The issuance and sale of these shares of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of the Convertible Notes and the market price of our Class A common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nWe cannot be sure that we will not need to raise additional capital in the future, as a result of economic conditions or otherwise. If we do need to raise additional capital, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on favorable terms or at all. In addition, any such financing could be significantly dilutive to our existing shareholders and result in the issuance of securities that have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions of the Convertible Notes could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.\nCertain provisions of the Convertible Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change, holders of the Convertible Notes have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their notes or any portion of the principal amount of such notes in integral multiples of $1,000. We may also be required to increase the conversion rate upon conversion in connection with certain fundamental change transactions. These provisions could deter unsolicited takeovers, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price or could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class A common stock.\nThe conditional conversion features of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion features of the Convertible Notes are triggered, holders of notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, we would be required to settle up to the principal amount of notes being converted through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to classify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current liability rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe convertible note hedge and warrant transactions we entered into in connection with our Convertible Notes issuance may affect the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nIn connection with our offering of the Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with several financial institutions, or the hedge counterparties. We entered into these convertible note hedge transactions with the expectation that they will reduce the potential dilution to our Class A common stock and/or offset potential cash payments in excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes, as the case may be, upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. In the event that the hedge counterparties fail to deliver shares to us or potential cash payments, as the case may be, as required under the convertible note hedge documents, we would not receive the benefit of such transactions. Separately, we also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. The warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect from the issuance of Class A common stock pursuant to the warrants.\nIn connection with hedging these transactions, the hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates may enter into various derivative transactions with respect to our Class A Common Stock, and may enter into, or may unwind, various derivative transactions and/or purchase or sell our Class A Common Stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so during any conversion period related to any conversion of the Convertible Notes). These activities could have the effect of increasing or preventing a decline in, or could have a negative effect on, the value of our Class A Common Stock and could have the effect of increasing or preventing a decline in the value of our Class A Common Stock during any cash settlement averaging period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes.\nWe do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Convertible Notes or the shares of our Class A common stock. In addition, we do not make any representation that the hedge counterparties will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.\nThe hedge counterparties are financial institutions or the affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that the hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If any of the hedge counterparties become subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors, but, generally, the increase in our exposure may be correlated to the increase in our Class A common stock market price and in volatility of our Class A common stock. In addition, upon a default by a hedge counterparty, we may suffer dilution with respect to our Class A common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the hedge counterparties.\nThe accounting method for the Convertible Notes may have an adverse effect on our reported financial results and is subject to uncertainty.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification Topic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (\u201cASC 470-20\u201d), an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Convertible Notes is that the equity component is included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated statements of financial condition and the value of the equity component is treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Convertible Notes. As a result, we are required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Convertible Notes to their face amount over the term of the Convertible Notes. We report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our Class A common stock and the trading price of the Convertible Notes.\nIn addition, the equity component of the Convertible Notes are accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the securities exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of Class A common stock that is necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected. In addition, if we are permitted to utilize the treasury stock method, to the extent that the market price of our Class A common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants we intend to sell to the hedge counterparties, the warrant transactions will be accounted for as if the number of shares of our Class A common stock that is necessary to settle such excess are issued. However, any shares we are entitled to receive from the hedge counterparties under the convertible note hedge transactions upon conversion of the notes, in the event that the market price of our Class A common stock exceeds the strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions, will not be reflected in our diluted earnings per share.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\nGlobal Brokerage, Inc.\u2019s only material asset is its interest in Holdings, and Holdings\u2019 only material asset is its interest in Group. Accordingly, Global Brokerage, Inc. depends upon distributions from Group and from Holdings to pay taxes, make payments of principal and interest on the Convertible Notes, make payments under the tax receivable agreement and pay dividends.\nGlobal Brokerage, Inc. is a holding company and has no material assets other than its ownership of Holdings Units. Holdings is also a holding company and has no material assets other than its 50.1% interest in Group. Global Brokerage, Inc. has no independent means of generating revenue. Global Brokerage, Inc. intends to cause Holdings to make distributions to its unitholders in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable taxes at assumed tax rates, payments of principal and interest on the Convertible Notes, payments under the tax receivable agreement and dividends, if any, declared by it. In turn, the sole source of such funds for Holdings is distributions from Group. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of Group and its subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay such distributions. Additionally, to the extent that Global Brokerage, Inc. needs funds, and Holdings and Group are restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of their financing arrangements, or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. In particular, the terms of Group\u2019s agreements with Leucadia significantly restrict the distributions that Group may make to Holdings, and these restrictions could materially impair the ability of Global Brokerage, Inc. to make payments on its obligations.\nMembers of Holdings control a significant portion of the voting power in Global Brokerage, Inc., which may give rise to conflicts of interests.\nAs of December 31, 2016, members of Holdings collectively held approximately 25.5% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. As a result, the members of Holdings have the ability to exercise significant influence over the election of the members of our board of directors and, therefore, significant influence over our management and affairs as well as matters requiring shareholder approval, including mergers and other material transactions. This\nconcentration of ownership could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their Class A common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nBecause the members of Holdings hold their ownership interest in our business through Holdings in addition to through the public company, these owners may have conflicting interests with holders of shares of our Class A common stock. For example, if Holdings makes distributions to Global Brokerage, Inc., these owners will also be entitled to receive distributions pro rata in accordance with the percentages of their respective limited liability company interests in Holdings and their preferences as to the timing and amount of any such distributions may differ from those of our public shareholders. The members of Holdings may also have different tax positions from us which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, especially in light of the existence of the tax receivable agreement that we entered into in connection with our initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d), whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, and whether and when Global Brokerage, Inc. should terminate the tax receivable agreement and accelerate its obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration these owners\u2019 tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us. See \u201cItem 13. Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions, and Director Independence.\u201d\nGlobal Brokerage, Inc. will be required to pay the counterparties to the tax receivable agreement for certain tax benefits it may claim arising in connection with our IPO and related transactions, and the amounts it may pay could be significant.\nIn connection with our IPO, we purchased Holdings Units from our pre-IPO owners, including members of our senior management. Subsequently, we have had additional unit conversions. At the IPO, we also entered into a tax receivable agreement with our pre-IPO owners that provides for the payment by Global Brokerage, Inc. to these parties of 85% of the benefits, if any, that Global Brokerage, Inc. is deemed to realize as a result of the increases in tax basis resulting from our purchases or exchanges of Holdings Units and certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. See \u201cItem 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax benefit attributable to the increase in tax basis discussed above. As the expected liability under the tax receivable agreement is directly attributable to the tax benefit received, and we expect no tax benefit, during 2015 we wrote down the liability to $0.1 million, the amount due for the 2014 benefit. Assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law, and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize all tax benefits that are subject to the tax receivable agreement or we have a triggering event as discussed below, as of December 31, 2016 future payments under the tax receivable agreement could aggregate to $145.6 million. The foregoing amount is merely an estimate and the actual payments could differ materially. It is possible that future transactions or events, including the events of January 15, 2015, could increase or decrease the actual tax benefits realized and the corresponding tax receivable agreement payments. There may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if, as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise, the payments under the tax receivable agreement exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement and/or distributions to Global Brokerage, Inc. by Holdings are not sufficient to permit Global Brokerage, Inc. to make payments under the tax receivable agreement after it has paid taxes. The payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon our pre-IPO owners\u2019 continued ownership of us.\nIn certain cases, payments under the tax receivable agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits Global Brokerage, Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement.\nThe tax receivable agreement provides that upon certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control, or if, at any time, Global Brokerage, Inc. elects an early termination of the tax receivable agreement, Global Brokerage, Inc.\u2019s (or its successor\u2019s) obligations with respect to exchanged or acquired Holdings Units (whether exchanged or acquired before or after such transaction) would be based on certain assumptions, including that Global Brokerage, Inc. would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement. As a result, (1) Global Brokerage, Inc. could be required to make payments under the tax receivable agreement that are greater than or less than the specified percentage of the actual benefits Global Brokerage, Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement and (2) if Global Brokerage, Inc. elects to terminate the tax receivable agreement early, Global Brokerage, Inc. would be required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits, which upfront payment may be made years in advance of the actual realization of such future benefits. Upon a subsequent actual exchange, any additional increase in tax deductions, tax basis and other benefits in excess of the amounts assumed at the change in control will also result in payments under the tax receivable agreement. In these situations, our obligations under the tax receivable agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity. There can be no assurance that we will be able\nto finance our obligations under the tax receivable agreement. In addition, the present value of such anticipated future payments are discounted at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 100 basis points.\nPayments under the tax receivable agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine. Although we are not aware of any issue that would cause the IRS to challenge a tax basis increase, Global Brokerage, Inc. will not be reimbursed for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement. As a result, in certain circumstances, payments could be made under the tax receivable agreement in excess of the benefits that Global Brokerage, Inc. actually realizes in respect of the increases in tax basis resulting from our purchases or exchanges of Holdings Units and certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents, Delaware law and our Amended and Restated Rights Agreement might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of Class A common stock;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws and that our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of 80% or more of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nAdditionally, our stockholder rights plan, which was approved by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to protect our NOLs (as defined below) during the effective period of the rights plan, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, Global Brokerage, Inc. or a large block of our Class A common stock. A third party that acquires 4.9% or more of our Class A common stock could suffer substantial dilution of its ownership interest under the terms of the rights plan through the issuance of common stock or common stock equivalents to all stockholders other than the acquiring person.\nThese anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our Class A common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be limited.\nWe have a federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) of $258.7 million as of December 31, 2016. These NOL carryforwards (expiring in 2032 through 2036) are available to offset future taxable income. The Company may recognize additional NOLs in the future.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income that may be offset by a corporation\u2019s NOLs if the corporation experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. An ownership change occurs when our \u201cfive-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined in Section 382 of the Code) collectively increase their ownership in Global Brokerage, Inc. by more than 50 percentage points (by value) over a rolling three-year period. Additionally, various states have similar limitations on the use of state NOLs following an ownership change.\nIf an ownership change occurs, the amount of the taxable income for any post-change year that may be offset by a pre-change loss is subject to an annual limitation that is cumulative to the extent it is not all utilized in a year. This limitation is\nderived by multiplying the fair market value of our Class A common stock as of the ownership change by the applicable federal long-term tax-exempt rate, which was 1.68% at December 31, 2016. To the extent that a company has a net unrealized built-in gain at the time of an ownership change, which is realized or deemed recognized during the five-year period following the ownership change, there is an increase in the annual limitation for each of the first five-years that is cumulative to the extent it is not all utilized in a year.\nWe have an ongoing study of the rolling three-year testing periods. Based upon the elections we have made and the information that has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission through March 15, 2017, we have not had a Section 382 ownership change through March 15, 2017.\nIf an ownership change should occur in the future, our ability to use the NOL to offset future taxable income will be subject to an annual limitation and will depend on the amount of taxable income generated by Global Brokerage, Inc. in future periods. There is no assurance that we will be able to fully utilize the NOL and we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance related to the amount of the NOL that may not be realized, which could impact our result of operations.\nWe believe that these NOL carryforwards are a valuable asset for us. Consequently, we have a stockholder rights plan in place, which was approved by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, to protect our NOLs during the effective period of the rights plan. Although the rights plan is intended to reduce the likelihood of an \u201cownership change\u201d that could adversely affect us, there is no assurance that the restrictions on transferability in the rights plan will prevent all transfers that could result in such an \u201cownership change.\u201d\nThe foregoing provisions may adversely affect the marketability of our Class A common stock by discouraging potential investors from acquiring our stock. In addition, these provisions could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us, or impede an attempt to acquire a significant or controlling interest in us, even if such events might be beneficial to us and our stockholders.\nRisks Related to our Class A Common Stock\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may decline due to the large number of shares of Class A common stock eligible for exchange and future sale.\nThe market price of shares of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of Class A common stock in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell shares of Class A common stock in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nIn addition, we and our pre-IPO owners entered into an exchange agreement under which they (or certain permitted transferees thereof) have the right, from and after the first anniversary of the date of the closing of the IPO (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement), to exchange their Holdings Units for shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments. The market price of shares of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of the exchange or the perception that an exchange could occur. These exchanges, or the possibility that these exchanges may occur, also might make it more difficult for holders of our Class A common stock to sell such stock in the future at a time and at a price that they deem appropriate.\nIf securities or industry analysts stop publishing research or reports about our business, or if they downgrade their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. Some of the analysts who previously covered our company have discontinued coverage, and some have downgraded their recommendation of our company. If any of the analysts who continue to cover or resume covering us in the future downgrades our Class A common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our Class A common stock price may decline. If additional analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our Class A common stock price or trading volume to decline and our Class A common stock to be less liquid.\nThe market price of shares of our Class A common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of shares of our Class A common stock in spite of our operating performance. In addition, our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors due to a number of potential factors, including variations in our quarterly operating results, additions or departures of key management personnel, failure to meet analysts\u2019 earnings estimates, publication of research reports about our industry, litigation and government investigations, changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations or enforcement thereof affecting our business, adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future, changes in market valuations of similar companies or speculation in the press or investment community, announcements by our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments, adverse publicity about the industries we participate in or individual scandals, and in response the market price of shares of our Class A common stock could decrease significantly. You may be unable to resell your shares of Class A common stock at or above the price you originally paid.\nIn the past few years, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against public companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nYou may be diluted by the future issuance of additional Class A common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of more than 2.99 billion shares of Class A common stock authorized but unissued, including approximately 2.1 million shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exchange of Holdings Units. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue these shares of Class A common stock and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to Class A common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our board of directors in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. We have reserved 1,529,500 shares for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan, including, as of December 31, 2016, 711,447 shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and 8,948 shares issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock units that we have granted to our officers, employees, independent contractors, outside directors and other. See \u201cItem 11. Executive Compensation.\u201d Any Class A common stock that we issue, including under our Amended and Restated 2010 Long Term Incentive Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership held by the investors.", "PERMNO": 12446, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "GLBR"}
