{"cik": "849636", "company": "RespireRx Pharmaceuticals Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-04-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our continuing operations and the price of our common stock are subject to the following risks:\nRisks related to our business\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn its audit opinion issued in connection with our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern given our limited working capital, recurring net losses and negative cash flows from operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence. While we have relied principally in the past on external financing to provide liquidity and capital resources for our operations, we can provide no assurance that cash generated from our operations together with cash received in the future from external financing, if any, will be sufficient to enable us to continue as a going concern.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has identified material weaknesses in our financial reporting process.\nAt December 31, 2020, management and our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our plans to remediate the material weaknesses in our financial reporting process. Our failure to successfully implement our plans to remediate these material weaknesses could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, to produce timely and reliable financial information, and to effectively prevent fraud. Additionally, such failure, or other weaknesses that we may experience in our financial reporting process or other internal controls, could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and stock price.\nWe have a history of net losses; we expect to continue to incur net losses and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nSince our formation on February 10, 1987 through the end of our most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, we have generated only minimal operating revenues. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, our net loss was $4,301,211 and as of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $170,810,296. We have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and it is possible that we will never generate revenues from product sales in the future. Even if we do achieve significant revenues from product sales, we expect to continue to incur significant net losses over the next several years. As with other biotechnology companies, it is possible that we will never achieve profitable operations.\nWe will need additional capital in the near term and the future and, if such capital is not available on terms acceptable to us or available to us at all, we may need to scale back our research and development efforts and may be unable to continue our business operations.\nWe require additional cash resources for basic operations and will require substantial additional funds to advance our research and development programs and to continue our operations, particularly if we decide to independently conduct later-stage clinical testing and apply for regulatory approval of any of our proposed products, and if we decide to independently undertake the marketing and promotion of our products. Additionally, we may require additional funds in the event that we decide to pursue strategic acquisitions of or licenses for other products or businesses. Based on our operating plan as of December 31, 2020, we estimated that our existing cash resources will not be sufficient to meet our requirements for 2021. We also need additional capital in the near term to fund on-going operations including basic operations. Additional funds may come from the sale of common equity, preferred equity, convertible preferred equity or equity-linked securities, debt, including debt convertible into equity, or may result from agreements with larger pharmaceutical companies that include the license or rights to the technologies and products that we are currently developing, although there is no assurance that we will secure any such funding or other transaction in a timely manner, or at all.\nOur cash requirements in the future may differ significantly from our current estimates, depending on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf Our ability to raise equity or debt capital, or our ability to obtain in-kind services which may be more difficult during the current pandemic health crisis;\n\u25cf the results of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf the costs associated with the implementation of a corporate restructure\n\u25cf the costs of setting up and operating our own marketing and sales organization;\n\u25cf the ability to obtain funding under contractual and licensing agreements;\nthe ongoing obligations to make contractual licensed patent maintenance fees, milestone payments and royalty payments\n\u25cf the costs involved in filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patents or any litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property;\n\u25cf the costs involved in meeting our contractual obligations including employment agreements; and\n\u25cf our success in entering into collaborative relationships with other parties.\nCommon Stock reserve requirements may restrict our ability to raise capital and continue to operate our business\nCommon Stock reserve requirements may restrict our ability to raise capital and continue to operate our business. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was required to reserve 126,855,971 shares of its authorized and unissued Common Stock with respect to convertible notes, convertible Series B Preferred Stock, warrants, options granted not yet exercised and shares available for issuance its equity plans, inclusive of incremental contractual reserves in excess of the calculated number of conversion shares and warrant shares. There are 1,801,872,935 authorized, unissued and unreserved shares of Common Stock available after reserving for the incremental contractual reserves of 68,777,142. If we breach the contractual reserve requirements we will be in default of such contractual obligations which may have material adverse consequences which may make it more difficult to raise additional necessary capital.\nOur product opportunities rely on licenses from research institutions and if we lose access to these technologies or applications, our business could be substantially impaired.\nThrough our acquisition of Pier, we gained access to a pre-existing relationship between Pier and the UIC. Effective in September 2014, the Company entered into the UIC License Agreement with the UIC, which gave the Company certain exclusive rights with respect to certain patents and patent applications in the United States and other countries claiming the use of dronabinol and other cannabinoids for the treatment of sleep-related breathing disorders, including sleep apnea. The UIC License Agreement obligates the Company to comply with various commercialization and reporting requirements and to make various royalty payments, including potential one-time and annual royalty payments, as well as payments upon the achievement of certain development milestones.\nThe Company and UWMRF executed the UWMRF Patent License Agreement effective August 1, 2020 pursuant to which RespireRx licensed the intellectual property identified therein, including with respect to GABAkines. In consideration for the licenses granted, the Company will pay to UWMRF patent filing and prosecution costs, annual license maintenance fees, one-time milestone payments, and annual royalties.\nIf we are unable to comply with the terms of these licenses, such as required payments thereunder, these licenses might be terminated.\nWe may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates and technologies.\nThe development of our product candidates is subject to risks commonly experienced in the development of products based upon innovative technologies and the expense and difficulty of obtaining approvals from regulatory agencies. Drug discovery and development is time consuming, expensive and unpredictable. On average, only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine.\nAll of our product candidates are in development spectrum that runs from preclinical to Phase 2 clinical trials, but we not have any currently active trials. Assuming these trials are initiated, which will require additional financing, we are planning for additional preclinical studies and Phase 1, Phase 2A, Phase 2B and Phase 3 clinical trials, we do not have any currently active trials. Accordingly, we will require significant additional funding for research, development and clinical testing of our product candidates, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nAdditionally, our success, at least in part, is dependent upon the strength of our intellectual property, including, but not limited to licensed and owned patents, patent applications, continuations-in-part, provisional patent applications, know-how, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property. The issuance of patents with relevant claims is subject to varying degrees of uncertainty. Our ability to defend our intellectual property or challenge third party intellectual property infringement claims is expensive, time consuming and uncertain. If our patent applications do not issue with relevant claims or if we cannot defend our patents, or, as appropriate, challenge interfering patents or actions of third parties, or otherwise maintain our intellectual property, our business and operations will be adversely affected.\nThe process from discovery to development to regulatory approval can take several years and drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process. Late-stage clinical trials often fail to replicate results achieved in earlier studies. We cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully complete any of our research and development activities. One of our product candidates is based, at least in part, on the development of one or more new formulations and the repurposing of an approved drug, the development of which is inherently risky while others of our product candidates have never been approved for marketing by any regulatory bodies and are subject to substantial research and development risks. Concerns about the safety and efficacy of our product candidates could limit our future success.\nEven if we do complete our research and development activities, we may not be able to successfully market any of the product candidates or be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or assure that healthcare providers and payors will accept our product candidates. We also face the risk that any or all of our product candidates will not work as intended or that they will be unsafe, or that, even if they do work and are safe, that our product candidates will be uneconomical to manufacture and market on a large scale. Due to the extended testing and regulatory review process required before we can obtain marketing clearance, we do not expect to be able to commercialize any therapeutic drug for several years, either directly or through our corporate partners or licensees.\nWe have announced a restructuring plan to facilitate the financing of our business initiatives. We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plan and the restructuring may adversely affect our business.\nWe plan to incorporate as newly formed subsidiaries, what are currently identified divisions of the Company, namely, ResolutionRx and EndeavourRx with the goals, among others, of improving our ability to finance those platforms and attract potential strategic partners. There can be no assurance that these goals or any of our intended goals will be achieved.\nWe have not voluntarily implemented various corporate governance measures, in the absence of which stockholders may have more limited protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interests and similar matters.\nWe have not adopted any corporate governance measures since our securities are not yet listed on a national securities exchange and we are not required to do so. We have not adopted corporate governance measures such as separate audit or other independent committees of our Board as we presently have only one independent director. If we expand our board membership in future periods to include additional independent directors, we may seek to establish an audit and other committees of our Board. It is possible that if our Board included additional independent directors and if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures, stockholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurances that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct. For example, in the absence of audit, nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority of independent directors, decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages to our senior officers and recommendations for director nominees may be made by a majority of directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided. You should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating investment decisions.\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic may negatively impact our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates and technologies and may ultimately affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, and governmental authorities around the world have implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These measures have adversely affected workforces, customers, supply chains, consumer sentiment, economies, and financial markets, and, along with decreased consumer spending, have led to an economic downturn across many global economies. The COVID-19 pandemic rapidly escalated in the United States and continues to evolve, creating significant uncertainty and economic disruption, and leading to record levels of unemployment nationally. Numerous state and local jurisdictions had imposed, and those and others in the future may impose, shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, shut-downs of non-essential businesses, and similar government orders and restrictions on their residents to control the spread of COVID-19.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and government responses thereto have made it very difficult to recruit clinical trial subjects and patients and to conduct clinical trials in general. We expect the life sciences industry and clinical trial activity to continue to face challenges arising from quarantines, site closures, travel limitations, interruptions to the supply chain for investigational products and other considerations if site personnel or trial subjects become infected with or are significantly at risk of contracting COVID-19. These challenges may lead to difficulties in meeting protocol-specified procedures. Further, in response to the public health emergency, the FDA issued guidance in March and July 2020 emphasizing that safety of trial participants is critically important. Decisions to continue or discontinue individual patients or the trial are expected to be made by trial sponsors in consultation with clinical investors and Institutional Review Boards, which may lead to the implementation of additional protocols such as COVID-19 screening procedures, resulting in potential delays and additional costs. The risks, strategic and operational challenges and costs of conducting such trials as a result of the global pandemic have exacerbated an already challenging clinical trial process, which may negatively impact our ability to plan or conduct trials if we secure sufficient financing to enable us to pursue such activity.\nIn addition, we may be impacted by the downturn in the U.S. economy, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to raise capital and our business operations.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 ultimately impacts our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic or treat its impact, among others. Additionally, the extent to which COVID-19 ultimately impacts our operations will depend on a number of factors, many of which will be outside of our control. The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving and new information emerges regularly, including for example, the FDA\u2019s and other governmental regulatory bodies\u2019 approval of various COVID-19 vaccinations products which are being widely distributed and administered in the United States and around the world; accordingly, the ultimate consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition to the disruptions adversely impacting our business and financial results, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in these risk factors, including risks relating to our ability to begin to generate revenue, to generate positive cash flow, our relationships with third parties, and many other factors. We will attempt to minimize these impacts, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so.\nWe may not be able to enter into the strategic alliances necessary to fully develop and commercialize our products and technologies, and we will be dependent on our strategic partners if we do.\nWe are seeking pharmaceutical companies and other strategic partners to participate with us in the development of major indications for the cannabinoids and neuromodulator compounds. These agreements would potentially provide us with additional funds or in-kind services in exchange for exclusive or non-exclusive license or other rights to the technologies and products that we are currently developing. Competition between biopharmaceutical companies for these types of arrangements is intense. We cannot give any assurance that our discussions with candidate companies will result in an agreement or agreements in a timely manner, or at all. Additionally, we cannot assure you that any resulting agreement will generate sufficient revenues to offset our operating expenses and longer-term funding requirements.\nIf our third-party manufacturers\u2019 facilities do not follow established current good manufacturing guidelines and practices, our product development and commercialization efforts may be harmed.\nThere are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under the FDA\u2019s and European Union\u2019s good manufacturing practices regulations and are capable of manufacturing products like those we are developing. Third-party manufacturers may encounter difficulties in achieving quality control and quality assurance and may experience shortages of qualified personnel. A failure of third-party manufacturers to follow current good manufacturing practices or other regulatory requirements and to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in the availability of products for commercial use or clinical study, the termination of, or hold on, a clinical study, or may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products. In addition, we could be subject to sanctions, including fines, injunctions and civil penalties. Changing manufacturers may require additional clinical trials and the revalidation of the manufacturing process and procedures in accordance with FDA mandated current good manufacturing practices and would require FDA approval. This revalidation may be costly and time consuming. If we are unable to arrange for third-party manufacturing of our products, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development or marketing of our products.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards will be subject to limitations upon a change in ownership, which could reduce our ability to use those loss carry forwards following any change in Company ownership.\nGenerally, a change of more than 50% in the ownership of a Company\u2019s stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An ownership change may limit our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards attributable to the period prior to such change. We have sold or otherwise issued shares of our common stock in various transactions sufficient to constitute an ownership change. As a result, if we earn net taxable income in the future, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry forwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income will be subject to limitations, which would restrict our ability to reduce future tax liability. Future shifts in our ownership, including transactions in which we may engage, may cause additional ownership changes, which could have the effect of imposing additional limitations on our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry forwards.\nRisks related to our industry\nIf we fail to secure adequate intellectual property protection, it could significantly harm our financial results and ability to compete.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and processes in the United States and elsewhere. We have filed and intend to continue to file patent applications as we need them. However, additional patents that may issue from any of these applications may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Also, any patents issued to us or licensed by us may be designed around or challenged by others, and if such design or challenge is effective, it may diminish our rights and negatively affect our financial results.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient protection of our proprietary rights in our products or processes prior to or after obtaining regulatory clearances, our competitors may be able to obtain regulatory clearance and market similar or competing products by demonstrating at a minimum the equivalency of their products to our products. If they are successful at demonstrating at least the equivalency between the products, our competitors would not have to conduct the same lengthy clinical tests that we have or will have conducted.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and confidential information that we protect by entering into confidentiality agreements with other parties. Those confidentiality agreements could be breached, and our remedies may be insufficient to protect the confidential information. Further, our competitors may independently learn our trade secrets or develop similar or superior technologies. To the extent that our consultants, key employees or others apply technological information independently developed by them or by others to our projects, disputes may arise regarding the proprietary rights to such information or developments. We cannot assure you that such disputes will be resolved in our favor.\nWe may be subject to potential product liability claims. One or more successful claims brought against us could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing of our products may expose us to product liability claims. We have never been subject to a product liability claim, and we require each patient in our clinical trials to sign an informed consent agreement that describes the risks related to the trials, but we cannot assure you that the coverage limits of our insurance policies will be adequate or that one or more successful claims brought against us would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and result of operations. Further, if one of our cannabinoid or AMPAkine compounds is approved by the FDA for marketing, we cannot assure you that adequate product liability insurance will be available, or if available, that it will be available at a reasonable cost. Any adverse outcome resulting from a product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition, and our competitors may develop products that are superior to those we are developing.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is characterized by intensive research efforts, rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary therapeutics. Our competitors include many companies, research institutes and universities that are working in a number of pharmaceutical or biotechnology disciplines to develop therapeutic products similar to those we are currently investigating. Most of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, distribution or other resources than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have experience in performing human clinical trials of new or improved therapeutic products and obtaining approvals from the FDA and other regulatory agencies. We have no experience in conducting and managing later-stage clinical testing or in preparing applications necessary to obtain regulatory approvals. We expect that competition in this field will continue to intensify.\nOur patents and patent applications do not cover the entire world, thus limiting the potential exclusive commercialization of our products to those countries in which we have intellectual property protection. We are aware of at least one company that may be developing a product or product similar to one of our prospective products for our proposed indication in countries where we do not have intellectual property protection. Such company or companies may choose to compete with us in countries where we do have intellectual property protection and cause us to expend resources defending our intellectual property. A liberal regulatory environment or unenforced or poorly enforced regulations may encourage competition from non-drug products such as medical marijuana or dietary supplements and similar products containing cannabis-derived molecules making claims that would be competitive with our proposed regulatory-approved claims. Since our target markets are very large, there is a great deal of economic incentive for others to enter and compete in those markets. We must compete with other companies with respect to their research and development efforts and for capital and other forms of funding. An inability to compete would have a material adverse impact on our business operations.\nWe may be unable to recruit and retain our senior management and other key technical personnel on whom we are dependent.\nWe are highly dependent upon senior management and key technical personnel and currently do not carry any insurance policies on such persons. In particular, we are highly dependent on Timothy L. Jones, our CEO and President, Arnold S. Lippa, Ph.D., our Chief Scientific Officer and Executive Chairman, Jeff E. Margolis, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, and David Dickason, our Senior Vice President of Preclinical Product Development. Competition for qualified employees among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies is intense. The loss of any of our senior management or other key employees, or our inability to attract, retain and motivate the additional or replacement highly skilled employees and consultants that our business requires, could substantially hurt our business prospects.\nThe regulatory approval process is expensive, time consuming, uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining required approvals for the commercialization of some of our products.\nThe FDA and other similar agencies in foreign countries have substantial requirements for therapeutic products. Such requirements often involve lengthy and detailed laboratory, clinical and post-clinical testing procedures and are expensive to complete. It often takes companies many years to satisfy these requirements, depending on the complexity and novelty of the product. The review process is also extensive, which may delay the approval process even more.\nAs of yet, we have not obtained any approvals to market our products. Further, we cannot assure you that the FDA or other regulatory agency will grant us approval for any of our products on a timely basis, if at all. Even if regulatory clearances are obtained, a marketed product is subject to continual review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on marketing or withdrawal of the product from the market.\nRisks related to capital structure\nOur stock price is volatile and our common stock could decline in value.\nOur Common Stock is currently quoted for public trading on the OTCQB Venture Market. The trading price of our Common Stock has been subject to wide fluctuations and may fluctuate in response to a number of factors, many of which will be beyond our control.\nThe market price of securities of life sciences companies in general has been very unpredictable. Broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs for us and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe range of sales prices of our common stock, as adjusted for the reverse stock-split effected on January 5, 2021, for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, as quoted on the OTC Markets, was $1.499 and $0.0200 and $8.5000 to $0.9800, respectively. The following factors, in addition to factors that affect that market generally, could significantly affect our business, and the market price of our common stock could decline:\n\u25cf competitors announcing technological innovations or new commercial products;\n\u25cf competitors\u2019 publicity regarding actual or potential products under development;\n\u25cf regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u25cf legal developments regarding cannabinoids and cannabis products in the United States and foreign countries\n\u25cf developments concerning proprietary rights, including patent litigation;\n\u25cf public concern over the safety of therapeutic products; and\n\u25cf changes in healthcare reimbursement policies, healthcare regulations and standard of care requirements.\nOur common stock is thinly traded and you may be unable to sell some or all of your shares at the price you would like, or at all, and sales of large blocks of shares may depress the price of our common stock.\nOur common stock has historically been sporadically or \u201cthinly-traded,\u201d meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing shares of our common stock at prevailing prices at any given time may be relatively small or nonexistent. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in shares of our common stock is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer that has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. This could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. You may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your purchase price, which may result in substantial losses to you. Also, as a consequence of this lack of liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the price of shares of our common stock in either direction. The price of shares of our common stock could, for example, decline precipitously in the event a large number of shares of our common shares are sold on the market without commensurate demand, as compared to a seasoned issuer which could better absorb those sales without adverse impact on its share price.\nThere is a large number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock that may be issued or sold, and if such shares are issued or sold, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 71,271,095 shares of our common stock outstanding on a post-reverse stock split basis which occurred on January 5, 2021.\nIf all warrants and options outstanding as of December 31, 2020 were exercised prior to their respective expiration dates, up to 35,974,567 additional shares of our common stock could become freely tradable. The issuance of such shares would dilute the interests of the current stockholders and sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could also make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were remaining outstanding convertible notes totaling $414,860 inclusive of accrued interest. Of that amount, $372,659 was convertible into 13,333,036 shares of common stock and $42,201 was convertible into an indeterminate number of shares of common stock as such notes may convert, at the option of each note holder, acting separately and independently of the other note holders, into the next exempt private securities offering of equity securities.\nIf we issue additional equity or equity-based securities, the number of shares of our common stock outstanding could increase substantially, which could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could also make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock.\nOur charter document and other governing documents may prevent or delay an attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove management.\nCertain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our business, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, allows the Board of Directors of the Company to issue, as of December 31, 2020, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with characteristics to be determined by the board, without stockholder approval. The ability of our Board of Directors to issue additional preferred stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing an attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove existing directors and management.\nHistorically, warrants to purchase common stock have been issued as compensation for professional services, typically related to fund raising or have been issued in connection with the issuance of certain notes.\nIn addition, on several occasions, certain executive officers, members of the Board of Directors and certain vendors have offered to forgive accrued compensation and other amounts due to them, and the Board of Directors accepted such offers in exchange for either shares of common stock or options to purchase common stock. In particular, if executive officers offered and if the Board of Directors accepts such offer(s) in the future, a significant number of shares of common stock or one or more options to purchase a significant number of shares of common stock could be issued or granted. The ability of our Board of Directors to issue additional shares of common stock or options to purchase shares of common stock, or warrants to purchase shares of common stock, may have the effect of delaying or preventing an attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove existing directors and management.\nIf our common stock is determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock in the secondary market.\nIn addition, our common stock may be subject to the so-called \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) has adopted regulations that define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange. For any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If our common stock is determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market.\nWe may issue additional shares of our Common Stock, and investment in our company is likely to be subject to substantial dilution.\nStockholders\u2019 interests in the Company will be diluted and stockholders may suffer dilution in their net book value per share when we issue additional shares. Dilution is the difference between what investors pay for their stock and the net tangible book value per share immediately after the additional shares are purchased. We are authorized to issue up to 2,000,000,000 (2 billion) shares of Common Stock. Our financing activities in the past focused on convertible note financing that requires us to issue shares of Common Stock to satisfy principal, interest and any applicable penalties related to these convertible notes. When required under the terms and conditions of the convertible notes, we issue additional shares of Common Stock that have a dilutive effect on our stockholders. We anticipate that all or at least a substantial portion of our future funding, if any, will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our Common Stock and so any investment in the Company will likely be diluted, with a resulting decline in the value of our Common Stock.\nAdditional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, and our ability to raise capital through equity financing may be limited by the number of authorized shares of our Common Stock. In order to raise significant additional amounts from equity financing, we will need to seek, and have sought, stockholder approval to amend our Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our Common Stock, and any such amendment would require the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock. If we are unable to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms, we may not be able to implement our business plan, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur Common Stock was subject to removal from the OTC Markets OTCQB quotation service due to our stock not have a closing bid price of at least $0.01 per share for a period of 10 consecutive trading days on or before December 10, 2020\nA downgrade of our Common Stock to the lower OTC Pink market occurred on December 10, 2020.\nTo bring the Company\u2019s stock price back into compliance, the Company gained stockholder approval for a ten-to-one (10:1) reverse stock split as described in Note 10. Subsequent Events-Special Meeting of the Stockholders. The reverse stock split occurred on January 5, 2021 and Common Stock began trading on a post-reverse stock split basis on the OTC Markets OTC Pink Market from January 6, 2021 through February 5, 2021 while measuring for thirty calendar days, compliance with the uplisting requirements for listing on the OTC Markets OTCQB Venture Market.\nOur common stock was subject to an uplisting back to the OTC Markets OTCQB quotation service on February 8, 2021\nDelaware law, our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws provides for the indemnification of our officers and directors at our expense, and correspondingly limits their liability, which may result in a major cost to us and hurt the interests of our shareholders because corporate resources may be expended for the benefit of officers and/or directors.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company, as amended (the \u201cBylaws\u201d) include provisions that eliminate the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director\u2019s duty of loyalty to the Company or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. These provisions eliminate the personal liability of our directors and our shareholders for monetary damages arising out of any violation of a director of his fiduciary duty of due care, but do not affect a director\u2019s liabilities under the federal securities laws or the recovery of damages by third parties.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on any investment in the shares of stock of our Company and any gain on an investment in our Company will need to come through an increase in our stock\u2019s price, which may never happen.\nWe have never paid any cash dividends and currently do not intend to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. To the extent that we require additional funding currently not provided for, our funding sources may prohibit the payment of a dividend. Because we do not currently intend to declare dividends, any gain on an investment in our Company will need to come through an increase in our Common Stock\u2019s price. This may never happen, and investors may lose all of their investment in our Company.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our Common Stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.\nCosts and expenses of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act are substantial and prevent us from achieving profitability.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and aspects of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to comprise a substantial portion of our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, and to make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, placing significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources.\nIf we fail to remain current on our reporting requirements, we could be periodically removed from the OTCQB, which would limit the ability of broker-dealers to sell our Common Stock and the ability of stockholders to sell their Common Stock in the secondary market.\nCompanies trading on the OTCQB must be reporting issuers under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and must be current in their filings under the Exchange Act to maintain price quotation privileges on the OTCQB. If we fail to remain current on our reporting requirements, we could be removed from the OTCQB and be forced to be traded on the OTC Pink Sheets, which requires a more challenging stock purchase process. As a result, the liquidity for our Common Stock could be adversely affected by limiting the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and the ability of stockholders to sell their Common Stock in the secondary market. The OTCQB is recognized by the SEC as an established public market. The OTC Pink Sheets is the lowest and most speculative tier of the three marketplaces for the trading of over-the-counter stocks.\nOTC Pink Sheets shares generally trade thinly and infrequently making it hard to buy or sell when the investor wants to complete a transaction. Accordingly, the market for our Common Stock would be significantly diminished if we were forced to trade on the OTC Pink Sheets market.", "PERMNO": 75962, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "RSPI"}
