{"cik": "1021635", "company": "OGE ENERGY CORP.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn the discussion of risk factors set forth below, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms \"we,\" \"our\" and \"us\" refer to the Company. In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K and other documents filed by us and/or our subsidiaries with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating OGE Energy and its subsidiaries. Such factors could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us or our subsidiaries. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nREGULATORY RISKS\nOG&E's profitability depends to a large extent on the ability to fully recover its costs from its customers in a timely manner, and there may be changes in the regulatory environment that impair its ability to recover costs from its customers.\nOG&E is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal and state utility regulatory agencies, which significantly influences its operating environment and its ability to fully recover its costs from utility customers. Recoverability of any under recovered amounts from OG&E's customers due to a rise in fuel costs is a significant risk. The utility commissions in the states where OG&E operates regulate many aspects of its utility operations including siting and construction of facilities, customer service and the rates that OG&E can charge customers. The profitability of the utility operations is dependent on OG&E's ability to fully recover costs related to providing energy and utility services to its customers in a timely manner. Any failure to obtain utility commission approval to increase rates to fully recover costs, or a delay in the receipt of such approval, could have an adverse impact on OG&E's results of operations. In addition, OG&E's jurisdictions have fuel adjustment clauses that permit OG&E to recover fuel costs through rates without a general rate case, subject to a later determination that such fuel costs were prudently incurred. If the state regulatory commissions determine that the fuel costs were not prudently incurred, recovery could be disallowed.\nIn recent years, the regulatory environments in which OG&E operates have received an increased amount of attention. It is possible that there could be changes in the regulatory environment that would impair OG&E's ability to fully recover costs historically paid by OG&E's customers. State utility commissions generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are being met. OG&E cannot assure that the OCC, APSC and the FERC will grant rate increases in the future or in the amounts requested, and they could instead lower OG&E's rates.\nOG&E is unable to predict the impact on its operating results from future regulatory activities of any of the agencies that regulate OG&E. Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on OG&E's results of operations.\nOG&E's rates are subject to rate regulation by the states of Oklahoma and Arkansas, as well as by a federal agency, whose regulatory paradigms and goals may not be consistent.\nOG&E is currently a vertically integrated electric utility. Most of its revenue results from the sale of electricity to retail customers subject to bundled rates that are approved by the applicable state utility commission.\nOG&E operates in Oklahoma and western Arkansas and is subject to rate regulation by the OCC and the APSC, in addition to FERC regulation of its transmission activities and any wholesale sales. Exposure to inconsistent state and federal regulatory standards may limit our ability to operate profitably. Further alteration of the regulatory landscape in which we operate, including a change in our authorized return on equity, may harm our financial position and results of operations.\nCosts of compliance with environmental laws and regulations are significant, and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect our results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, wildlife conservation, natural resources and health and safety that could, among other things, restrict or limit the output of certain facilities or the use of certain fuels required for the production of electricity and/or require additional pollution control equipment and otherwise increase costs. There are significant capital, operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules and regulations and those costs may be even more significant in the future.\nIn response to recent regulatory and judicial decisions and international accords, emissions of greenhouse gases including, most significantly, CO2 could be restricted in the future as a result of federal or state legal requirements or litigation relating to greenhouse gas emissions. No rules are currently in effect that require us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, but if such rules\nwere to become effective, they could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect our future consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.\nThere is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in our operations and historical industry operations practices. These activities are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that can restrict or impact OG&E's business activities in many ways, such as restricting the way OG&E can handle or dispose of its wastes or requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions that may be caused by its operations or that are attributable to former operators. OG&E may be unable to recover these costs from insurance or other regulatory mechanisms. Moreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary.\nFor further discussion of environmental matters that may affect the Company, see \"Environmental Laws and Regulations\" in \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nWe may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial investment in capital improvements and additions.\nOG&E has recently made substantial investments in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits. OG&E's business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives. Significant portions of OG&E's facilities were constructed many years ago. Older generation equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures to maintain efficiency, to comply with environmental requirements or to provide reliable operations. OG&E currently provides service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions. If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates OG&E charges, it would not be able to recover the costs associated with its planned extensive investment. This could adversely affect OG&E's financial position and results of operations. While OG&E may seek to limit the impact of any denied recovery by attempting to reduce the scope of its capital investment, there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of any such mitigation efforts, particularly with respect to previously incurred costs and commitments.\nAs of December 31, 2018, OG&E had invested $504.3 million in the Dry Scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and is currently seeking recovery of its investment with the OCC.\nThe regional power market in which OG&E operates has changing transmission regulatory structures, which may affect the transmission assets and related revenues and expenses.\nOG&E currently owns and operates transmission and generation facilities as part of a vertically integrated utility. OG&E is a member of the SPP regional transmission organization and has transferred operational authority (but not ownership) of OG&E's transmission facilities to the SPP. The SPP has implemented regional day ahead and real-time markets for energy and operating reserves, as well as associated transmission congestion rights. Collectively the three markets operate together under the global name, SPP Integrated Marketplace. OG&E represents owned and contracted generation assets and customer load in the SPP Integrated Marketplace for the sole benefit of its customers. OG&E has not participated in the SPP Integrated Marketplace for any speculative trading activities. OG&E records the SPP Integrated Marketplace transactions as sales or purchases with results reported as Operating Revenues or Cost of Sales in its Consolidated Financial Statements. OG&E's revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities may be adversely affected by changes in the organization, operation and regulation of the SPP Integrated Marketplace by the FERC or the SPP.\nIncreased competition resulting from restructuring efforts could have a significant financial impact on us and consequently decrease our revenue.\nWe have been and will continue to be affected by competitive changes to the utility and energy industries. Significant changes have occurred and additional changes have been proposed to the wholesale electric market. Although retail restructuring efforts in Oklahoma and Arkansas have been postponed for the time being, if such efforts were renewed, retail competition and the unbundling of regulated energy service could have a significant financial impact on us due to possible impairments of assets, a loss of retail customers, lower profit margins and/or increased costs of capital. Any such restructuring could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot predict when we will be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, nor can we predict the impact of these changes on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nEvents that are beyond our control have increased the level of public and regulatory scrutiny of our industry. Governmental and market reactions to these events may have negative impacts on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and access to capital.\nAs a result of accounting irregularities at public companies in general, and energy companies in particular, and investigations by governmental authorities into energy trading activities, public companies, including those in the regulated and unregulated utility business, have been under public and regulatory scrutiny and suspicion. The accounting irregularities have caused regulators and legislators to review current accounting practices, financial disclosures and relationships between companies and their independent auditors. The capital markets and rating agencies also have increased their level of scrutiny. We believe that we are complying with all applicable laws and accounting standards, but it is difficult or impossible to predict or control what effect these types of events may have on our business, consolidated financial position, cash flows or access to the capital markets. It is unclear what additional laws or regulations may develop, and we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any future changes in accounting regulations or practices in general with respect to public companies, the energy industry or our operations specifically. Any new accounting standards could affect the way we are required to record revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. These changes in accounting standards could lead to negative impacts on reported earnings or decreases in assets or increases in liabilities that could, in turn, affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to substantial utility and energy regulation by governmental agencies. Compliance with current and future utility and energy regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary approvals, permits and certifications may result in significant costs to us.\nWe are subject to substantial regulation from federal, state and local regulatory agencies. We are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations and to obtain permits, approvals and certifications from the governmental agencies that regulate various aspects of our businesses, including customer rates, service regulations, retail service territories, sales of securities, asset acquisitions and sales, accounting policies and practices and the operation of generating facilities. We believe the necessary permits, approvals and certificates have been obtained for our existing operations and that our business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, we are unable to predict the impact on our operating results from future regulatory activities of these agencies.\nIn compliance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC approved the NERC as the national energy reliability organization. The NERC is responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory reliability and cyber security standards for the wholesale electric power system. OG&E's plan is to comply with all applicable standards and to expediently correct a violation should it occur. One of OG&E's regulators, the NERC, has comprehensive regulations and standards related to the reliability and security of our operating systems, and is continuously developing additional mandatory compliance requirements for the utility industry. The increasing development of NERC rules and standards will increase compliance costs and our exposure for potential violations of these standards.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nOur results of operations may be impacted by disruptions beyond our control.\nWe are exposed to risks related to performance of contractual obligations by our suppliers. We are dependent on coal and natural gas for much of our electric generating capacity. We rely on suppliers to deliver coal and natural gas in accordance with short and long-term contracts. We have certain supply contracts in place; however, there can be no assurance that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply coal and natural gas to us. The suppliers under these agreements may experience financial or technical problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. In addition, the suppliers under these agreements may not be required to supply coal and natural gas to us under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. Deliveries may be subject to short-term interruptions or reductions due to various factors, including transportation problems, weather and availability of equipment. Failure or delay by our suppliers of coal and natural gas deliveries could disrupt our ability to deliver electricity and require us to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of our customers.\nAlso, because our generation and transmission systems are part of an interconnected regional grid, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption or black-out caused by an event such as a severe storm, generator or transmission facility outage on a neighboring system or the actions of a neighboring utility. Any such disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair assets, which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOG&E's electric generation, transmission and distribution assets are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses, increased purchase power costs, accidents and third-party liability.\nOG&E owns and operates coal-fired, natural gas-fired, wind-powered and solar-powered generating assets. Operation of electric generation, transmission and distribution assets involves risks that can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels or that could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution and impairment of OG&E's operations. Included among these risks are:\n\u2022\nincreased prices for fuel and fuel transportation as existing contracts expire;\n\u2022\nfacility shutdowns due to a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes or interruptions in fuel supply;\n\u2022\noperator error or safety related stoppages;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in the delivery of electricity; and\n\u2022\ncatastrophic events such as fires, explosions, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes or other similar occurrences.\nThe occurrence of any of these events, if not fully covered by insurance, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Further, when unplanned maintenance work is required on power plants or other equipment, OG&E will not only incur unexpected maintenance expenses, but it may also have to make spot market purchases of replacement electricity that could exceed OG&E's costs of generation or be forced to retire a generation unit if the cost or timing of the maintenance is not reasonable and prudent. If OG&E is unable to recover any of these increased costs in rates, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nChanges in technology, regulatory policies and customer electricity consumption may cause our assets to be less competitive and impact our results of operations.\nOG&E primarily generates electricity at large central facilities. This method typically results in economies of scale and lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells, microturbines, windmills and photovoltaic solar cells. It is possible that advances in technologies or changes in regulatory policies will reduce costs of new technology to levels that are equal to or below that of most central station electricity production, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. OG&E's widespread use of Smart Grid technology allowing for two-way communications between the utility and its customers could enable the entry of technology companies into the interface between OG&E and its customers, resulting in unpredictable effects on our current business.\nReductions in customer electricity consumption, thereby reducing utility electric sales, could result from increased deployment of renewable energy technologies as well as increased efficiency of household appliances, among other general efficiency gains in technology. However, this potential reduction in load would not reduce our need for ongoing investments in our infrastructure to reliably serve our customers. Continued utility infrastructure investment without increased electricity sales could cause increased rates for customers, potentially resulting in further reductions in electricity sales and reduced profitability.\nEconomic conditions could negatively impact our business and our results of operations.\nOur operations are affected by local, national and worldwide economic conditions. The consequences of a recession could include a lower level of economic activity and uncertainty regarding energy prices and the capital and commodity markets. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could adversely affect our revenues and future growth. Instability in the financial markets, as a result of recession or otherwise, also could affect the cost of capital and our ability to raise capital. Economic conditions may also impact the valuation of certain long-lived assets, including our investment in unconsolidated affiliates, that are subject to impairment testing, potentially resulting in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nEconomic conditions may be impacted by insufficient financial sector liquidity leading to potential increased unemployment, which could impact the ability of our customers to pay timely, increase customer bankruptcies, and could lead to increased bad debt. If such circumstances occur, we expect that commercial and industrial customers would be impacted first, with residential customers following.\nIn addition, economic conditions, particularly budget shortfalls, could increase the pressure on federal, state and local governments to raise additional funds by increasing corporate tax rates and/or delaying, reducing or eliminating tax credits, grants or other incentives that could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to financial risks associated with climate change.\nClimate change creates financial risk. Potential regulation associated with climate change legislation could pose financial risks to the Company. In addition, to the extent that any climate change adversely affects the national or regional economic health through physical impacts or increased rates caused by the inclusion of additional regulatory imposed costs, CO2 taxes or costs associated with additional regulatory requirements, the Company may be adversely impacted. A declining economy could adversely impact the overall financial health of the Company due to a lack of load growth and decreased sales opportunities. To the extent financial markets view climate change and emissions of greenhouse gases as a financial risk, this could negatively affect our ability to access capital markets or cause us to receive less than ideal terms and conditions.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks and increased reliance on processes automated by technology.\nIn the regular course of our businesses, we handle a range of sensitive security and customer information. We are subject to laws and rules issued by different agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information. A security breach of our information systems such as theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including confidential customer information or system operating information, could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOG&E operates in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite implementation of security measures, the technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access. Such failures or breaches of the systems could impact the reliability of OG&E's generation, transmission and distribution systems which may result in a loss of service to customers and also subject OG&E to financial harm due to the significant expense to repair security breaches or system damage. The implementation of OG&E's Smart Grid program further increases potential risks associated with cybersecurity attacks. Our generation and transmission systems are part of an interconnected system. Therefore, a disruption caused by the impact of a cybersecurity incident of the regional electric transmission grid, natural gas pipeline infrastructure or other fuel sources of our third party service providers' operations, could also negatively impact our business. If the technology systems were to fail or be breached and not recovered in a timely manner, critical business functions could be impaired and sensitive confidential data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nSecurity threats continue to evolve and adapt. We and our third-party vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems, or confidential data, or to disrupt operations. None of these attempts has individually or in aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Despite implementation of security and control measures, there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent the unauthorized access of our systems and data, or the disruption of our operations, either of which could have a material impact. Our security procedures, which include among others, virus protection software, cybersecurity and our business continuity planning, including disaster recovery policies and back-up systems, may not be adequate or implemented properly to fully address the adverse effect of cybersecurity attacks on our systems, which could adversely impact our operations.\nWe maintain property, casualty and cybersecurity insurance that may cover certain resultant physical damage or third-party injuries caused by potential cyber events. However, damage and claims arising from such incidents may exceed the amount of any insurance available and other damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered at all. For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nTerrorist attacks, and the threat of terrorist attacks, have resulted in increased costs to our business. Continued hostilities or sustained military campaigns may adversely impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe long-term impact of terrorist attacks and the magnitude of the threat of future terrorist attacks on the electric utility and natural gas midstream industry in general, and on us in particular, cannot be known. Increased security measures taken by us as a precaution against possible terrorist attacks have resulted in increased costs to our business. Uncertainty surrounding continued hostilities or sustained military campaigns may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of supplies and markets for our products, and the possibility that our infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. Changes in the insurance markets attributable to terrorist attacks may make certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain. Moreover, the insurance that may be available to us may be significantly more expensive than existing insurance coverage.\nWeather conditions such as tornadoes, thunderstorms, ice storms, wind storms, earthquakes, prolonged droughts and the occurrence of wildfires, as well as seasonal temperature variations may adversely affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electric power. In OG&E's service area, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also typically peaking at that time. As a result, overall operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis. In addition, we have historically sold less power, and consequently received less revenue, when weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce our revenues, net income, available cash and borrowing ability. Severe weather, such as tornadoes, thunderstorms, ice storms, wind storms, earthquakes, prolonged droughts and the occurrence of wildfires may cause outages and property damage which may require us to incur additional costs that are generally not insured and that may not be recoverable from customers. The effect of the failure of our facilities to operate as planned, as described above, would be particularly burdensome during a peak demand period. In addition, prolonged droughts could cause a lack of sufficient water for use in cooling during the electricity generating process. Additionally, if climate change exacerbates physical changes in weather, operations may be impacted as discussed above.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nMarket performance, increased retirements, changes in retirement plan regulations and increasing costs associated with our Pension Plan, health care plans and other employee-related benefits may adversely affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe have a Pension Plan that covers a significant amount of our employees hired before December 1, 2009. We also have defined benefit postretirement plans that cover a significant amount of our employees hired prior to February 1, 2000. Assumptions related to future costs, returns on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions with respect to the defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans have a significant impact on our results of operations and funding requirements. Based on our assumptions at December 31, 2018, we expect to make future contributions to maintain required funding levels. It has been our practice to also make voluntary contributions to maintain more prudent funding levels than minimally required. We may continue to make voluntary contributions in the future. These amounts are estimates and may change based on actual stock market performance, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations.\nIf the employees who participate in the Pension Plan retire when they become eligible for retirement over the next several years, or if our plan experiences adverse market returns on its investments, or if interest rates materially fall, our pension expense and contributions to the plans could rise substantially over historical levels. The timing and number of employees retiring and selecting the lump-sum payment option could result in pension settlement charges that could materially affect our results of operations if we are unable to recover these costs through our electric rates. In addition, assumptions related to future costs, returns on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions, including projected retirements, have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Those factors are outside of our control.\nIn addition to the costs of our Pension Plan, the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years. We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to health care plans for our employees, will continue to rise. The increasing costs and funding requirements with our Pension Plan, health care plans and other employee benefits may adversely affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nFinally, the Company provides retirement benefits and retiree health care benefits to 90 employees seconded to Enable. If the seconding agreement was terminated, and those employees were no longer employed by the Company, and lump sum payments were made to those employees, the Company would recognize a settlement or curtailment of the pension/retiree health care charges, which would increase expense at the Company by $20.4 million. Settlement and curtailment charges associated with the Enable seconded employees are not reimbursable to the Company by Enable. The seconding agreement can be terminated by mutual agreement of the Company and Enable or solely by the Company upon 120 day's notice.\nWe face certain human resource risks associated with the availability of trained and qualified labor to meet our future staffing requirements.\nWorkforce demographic issues challenge employers nationwide and are of particular concern to the electric utility industry. The median age of utility workers is significantly higher than the national average. Over the next three years, 32 percent of our current employees will meet the eligibility requirements to retire. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business.\nWe are a holding company with our primary assets being investments in our subsidiary and equity investments.\nWe are a holding company and thus our investments in our subsidiary and unconsolidated affiliate, accounted for under the equity method, are our primary assets. Substantially all of our operations are conducted by our subsidiary and unconsolidated affiliate. Consequently, our operating cash flow and our ability to pay our dividends and service our indebtedness utilizes the operating cash flow of our subsidiary and unconsolidated affiliate and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or distributions. At December 31, 2018, the Company and its subsidiary had outstanding indebtedness and other liabilities of $6.7 billion. Our subsidiary and unconsolidated affiliate are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our indebtedness or to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise. In addition, their ability to pay dividends to us depends on any statutory and contractual restrictions that may be applicable to such subsidiary, which may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of working capital and other assets. Claims of creditors, including general creditors, of our subsidiary or unconsolidated affiliate on their respective assets will generally have priority over our claims (except to the extent that we may be a creditor of the subsidiaries and our claims are recognized) and claims by our shareholders.\nIn addition, as discussed above, OG&E is regulated by state utility commissions in Oklahoma and Arkansas as well as a federal regulatory agency which generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are being met. To the extent that the state commissions or federal regulatory agency attempt to impose restrictions on the ability of OG&E to pay dividends to us, it could adversely affect our ability to continue to pay dividends.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents have anti-takeover effects.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as the Oklahoma corporation statute, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company. Such provisions, including those regulating the nomination of directors, limiting who may call special stockholders' meetings and eliminating stockholder action by written consent, together with the possible issuance of preferred stock of the Company without stockholder approval, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of our common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in such stockholder's best interest.\nWe may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our indebtedness.\nThe terms of the indentures governing our debt securities do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness. If we are in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in our revolving credit agreements and the indentures governing our debt securities, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness. If we incur additional indebtedness, the related risks that we now face may intensify.\nAny reductions in our credit ratings could increase our financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships or limit our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms.\nWe cannot assure you that any of our current credit ratings or the ratings of our subsidiaries will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Our ability to access the commercial paper market could be adversely impacted by a credit ratings downgrade or major market disruptions. Pricing grids associated with our credit facilities could cause annual fees and borrowing rates to increase if an adverse rating impact occurs. The impact of any future downgrade could include an increase in the costs of our short-term borrowings, but a reduction in our credit ratings would not result in any defaults or accelerations. Any future downgrade could also lead to higher long-term borrowing costs and, if below investment grade, would require us to post collateral or letters of credit.\nOur debt levels may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.\nWe have revolving credit agreements for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate purposes. The levels of our debt could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms;\n\u2022\na portion of cash flows will be required to make interest payments on the debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities; and\n\u2022\nour debt levels may limit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our key customers and counterparties, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our key customers and counterparties could adversely affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to credit risks in our generation and retail distribution operations. Credit risk includes the risk that counterparties who owe us money or energy will breach their obligations. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements. In that event, our financial results could be adversely affected and we could incur losses.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INVESTMENT IN ENABLE MIDSTREAM PARTNERS\nThe Company does not control Enable and therefore is not able to cause or prevent certain actions by Enable. The general partnership of Enable is equally controlled by the Company and CenterPoint.\nEnable has its own governing board; therefore, the Company is not able to exercise control over Enable. Accordingly, the Company is unable to cause or prevent certain actions by Enable. Further, the Company cannot control the actions of the other general partner, CenterPoint. Our interests may not align with those of CenterPoint, and this lack of control could adversely impact our investment in Enable.\nA portion of our earnings and operating cash flows are based on the performance of Enable. If any of the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur operating cash flow is derived partially from cash distributions we receive from Enable.\nOur operating cash flow is derived partially from cash distributions we receive from Enable. The amount of cash Enable can distribute on its units principally depends upon the amount of cash generated from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe fees and gross margins it realizes with respect to the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil that it handles;\n\u2022\nthe prices of, levels of production of, and demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;\n\u2022\nthe volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil it gathers, compresses, treats, dehydrates, processes, fractionates, transports and stores;\n\u2022\nthe relationship among prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;\n\u2022\ncash calls and settlements of hedging positions;\n\u2022\nmargin requirements on open price risk management assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe level of competition from other companies offering midstream services;\n\u2022\nadverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation;\n\u2022\nthe level of its operation and maintenance expenses and general and administrative costs; and\n\u2022\nprevailing economic conditions.\nIn addition, the actual amount of cash Enable will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe level and timing of capital expenditures it makes;\n\u2022\nthe cost of acquisitions;\n\u2022\nits debt service requirements and other liabilities;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in working capital needs;\n\u2022\nits ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;\n\u2022\nrestrictions contained in its debt agreements;\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash reserves established by its general partner;\n\u2022\ndistributions paid on its Series A Preferred Units; and\n\u2022\nother business risks affecting its cash levels.\nEnable's contracts are subject to renewal risk.\nAs contracts with Enable's existing suppliers and customers expire, Enable negotiates extensions or renewals of those contracts or enters into new contracts with other suppliers and customers. Enable may be unable to extend or renew existing contracts or enter into new contracts on favorable commercial terms, if at all. Depending on prevailing market conditions at the time of an extension or renewal, gathering and processing customers with fee-based contracts may desire to enter into contracts under different fee arrangements, and gathering and processing customers with contracts that contain minimum volume\ncommitments may desire to enter into contracts without minimum volume commitments. Likewise, Enable's transportation and storage customers may choose not to extend or renew expiring contracts based on the economics of the related areas of production. To the extent Enable is unable to renew or replace its expiring contracts on terms that are favorable to Enable, if at all, or successfully manage its overall contract mix over time, its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us, could be adversely affected.\nAs further discussed in \"Natural Gas Midstream Operations - Enable Midstream Partners\" in \"Item 1. Business,\" in 2018, the FERC approved Spire Inc.'s STL Pipeline, an interstate pipeline that is currently under construction and will serve the St. Louis, Missouri market. When this pipeline is placed into service, Enable anticipates that Spire Inc.'s need for firm transportation and storage capacity on Enable's pipelines will decrease.\nEnable depends on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its gathering and processing revenues and its transportation and storage revenues. The loss of, or reduction in volumes from, these customers could result in a decline in sales of its gathering and processing or transportation and storage services and adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, 61 percent of Enable's natural gas gathered volumes were attributable to the affiliates of Continental Resources, Inc., Vine Oil and Gas, GeoSouthern Energy Corporation, XTO Energy Inc. and Tapstone Corporation and 51 percent of its transportation and storage service revenues were attributable to affiliates of CenterPoint, Spire Inc., Continental Resources, Inc., American Electric Power Co. and the Company. The loss of all or even a portion of the gathering and processing or transportation and storage services for any of these customers (as discussed above and in \"Item 1. Business\" regarding Spire Inc.), the failure to extend or replace these contracts or the extension or replacement of these contracts on less favorable terms, as a result of competition or otherwise, could adversely affect Enable's financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us.\nThe businesses of Enable are dependent, in part, on the drilling and production decisions of others.\nThe businesses of Enable are dependent on the drilling and production of natural gas and crude oil. Enable has no control over the level of drilling activity in its areas of operation, or the amount of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves associated with wells connected to its systems. In addition, as the rate at which production from wells currently connected to its system naturally declines over time, its gross margin associated with those wells will also decline. To maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation systems and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants, its customers must continually obtain new natural gas, NGLs and crude oil supplies. The primary factors affecting its ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil and attract new customers to its assets are the level of successful drilling activity near its systems, its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells and its ability to expand its capacity as needed. If Enable is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas and crude oil to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells, throughput on its gathering, processing, transportation and storage facilities would decline, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us. Enable has no control over producers or their drilling and production decisions, which are affected by, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of capital;\n\u2022\nprevailing and projected commodity prices, including the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;\n\u2022\ndemand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;\n\u2022\nlevels of reserves;\n\u2022\ngeological considerations;\n\u2022\nenvironmental or other governmental regulations, including the availability of drilling permits, the regulation of hydraulic fracturing and the regulation of air emissions; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of drilling rigs and other costs of production and equipment.\nFluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of new natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves. Drilling and production activity generally decreases as commodity prices decrease. In general terms, the prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond its control. Because of these and other factors, even if new reserves are known to exist in areas served by Enable's assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. Declines in natural gas, NGLs or crude oil prices can have a negative impact on exploration, development and production activity and, if sustained, could lead to decreases in such activity. Sustained low natural gas, NGLs or crude oil prices could also lead producers to shut in production from their existing wells. Sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in its areas of operation could lead to further\nreductions in the utilization of its systems, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nIn addition, it may be more difficult to maintain or increase the current volumes on its gathering systems and in its processing plants, as several of the formations in the unconventional resource plays in which Enable operates generally have higher initial production rates and steeper production decline curves than wells in more conventional basins. Should Enable determine that the economics of its gathering assets do not justify the capital expenditures needed to grow or maintain volumes associated therewith, it may reduce such capital expenditures, which could cause revenues associated with these assets to decline over time.\nEnable's industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us.\nEnable competes with similar enterprises in its respective areas of operation. The principal elements of competition are rates, terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service. Competitors include large energy companies that have greater financial resources and access to supplies of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil other than Enable. Some of these competitors may expand or construct gathering, processing, transportation and storage systems that would create additional competition for the services Enable provides to its customers. Excess pipeline capacity in the regions served by Enable's interstate pipelines could also increase competition and adversely impact the ability to renew or enter into new contracts with respect to available capacity when existing contracts expire. In addition, customers that are significant producers of natural gas or crude oil may develop their own gathering, processing, transportation and storage systems in lieu of using Enable. Enable's ability to renew or replace existing contracts with customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of its competitors and customers. Further, natural gas utilized as a fuel competes with other forms of energy available to end-users, including electricity, coal and liquid fuels. Increased demand for such forms of energy at the expense of natural gas could lead to a reduction in demand for natural gas gathering, processing, transportation and storage services. All of these competitive pressures could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us.\nEnable derives a substantial portion of its gross margin from subsidiaries through which it holds a substantial portion of its assets.\nEnable derives a substantial portion of its gross margin from, and holds a substantial portion of its assets through, its subsidiaries. As a result, it depends on distributions from its subsidiaries in order to meet its payment obligations. In general, these subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide Enable with funds for its payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends, limit its subsidiaries' ability to make payments or other distributions, and its subsidiaries could agree to contractual restrictions on its ability to make distributions.\nThe right by Enable to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of its creditors to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary's creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if Enable were a creditor of any subsidiary, its rights as a creditor would be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by them.\nThe amount of cash Enable has available for distribution to its limited partners depends primarily on its cash flow rather than on its profitability, which may prevent Enable from making distributions, even during periods in which it records net income.\nThe amount of cash Enable has available for distribution depends primarily upon its cash flow rather than on profitability. Profitability is affected by non-cash items but cash flow is not. As a result, Enable may make cash distributions during periods when it records losses for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records net earnings for financial accounting purposes.\nEnable may not be able to recover the costs of its substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions, and the actual cost of such improvements and additions may be significantly higher than it anticipates.\nEnable's business plan calls for investments in capital improvements and additions. Capital expenditures could range from approximately $325 million to $425 million for the year ending December 31, 2019.\nThe construction of additions or modifications to Enable's existing systems, and the construction of new midstream assets, involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed estimates. These projects may not be completed at\nthe planned cost, on schedule or at all. The construction of new pipeline, gathering, treating, processing, compression or other facilities is subject to construction cost overruns due to labor costs, costs and availability of equipment and materials such as steel, labor shortages or weather or other delays, inflation or other factors, which could be material. In addition, the construction of these facilities is typically subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies. Those agencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner, if at all, or may impose restrictions or conditions on the projects that could potentially prevent a project from proceeding, lengthen its expected completion schedule and/or increase its anticipated cost. Moreover, revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if an existing pipeline is expanded or a new pipeline is constructed, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, and Enable may not receive any material increases in revenues or cash flows until the project is completed. In addition, Enable may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, the new facilities may not be able to achieve an expected investment return, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nIn connection with its capital investments, Enable may estimate, or engage a third party to estimate, potential reserves in areas to be developed prior to constructing facilities in those areas. To the extent Enable relies on estimates of future production in deciding to construct additions to its systems, those estimates may prove to be inaccurate either in volume or timing due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating future production. To the extent estimates of the volume of new production are inaccurate, new facilities may not be able to attract sufficient throughput to achieve expected investment return, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us. To the extent estimates in the timing of new production are inaccurate, new facilities may be constructed in advance of the actual need for capacity or may not be constructed in time to accommodate volume flows, which could adversely affect Enable's financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us. In addition, the construction of additions to existing gathering and transportation assets may require new rights-of-way prior to construction. Those rights-of-way to connect new natural gas supplies to existing gathering lines may be unavailable, and it may not be able to capitalize on attractive expansion opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive to obtain new rights-of-way or to renew existing rights-of-way. If the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights-of-way increases, its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us, could be adversely affected.\nNatural gas, NGLs and crude oil prices are volatile, and changes in these prices could adversely affect Enable's financial position, results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us.\nEnable's financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to us could be negatively affected by adverse changes in the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil depending on factors that are beyond its control. These factors include demand for these commodities, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including the impact of seasonality and weather, general economic conditions, the level of domestic and offshore natural gas production and consumption, the availability of imported natural gas, liquefied natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, actions taken by foreign natural gas and oil producing nations, the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems, the availability and marketing of competitive fuels, the impact of energy conservation efforts, technological advances affecting energy consumption and the extent of governmental regulation and taxation.\nEnable's natural gas processing arrangements expose Enable to commodity price fluctuations. In 2018, six percent, 27 percent and 67 percent of Enable's processing plant inlet volumes consisted of keep-whole arrangements, percent-of-proceeds or percent-of-liquids and fee-based, respectively. If the price at which Enable sells natural gas or NGLs is less than the cost at which it purchases natural gas or NGLs under these arrangements, then its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us, could be adversely affected.\nAt any given time, Enable's overall portfolio of processing contracts may reflect a net short position in natural gas (meaning that it is a net buyer of natural gas) and a net long position in NGLs (meaning that it is a net seller of NGLs). As a result, Enable's financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us, could be adversely affected to the extent the price of NGLs decreases in relation to the price of natural gas.\nEnable's exposure to credit risks of its customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by its customers could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us.\nSome of Enable's customers may experience financial problems that could have a significant effect on its customers' creditworthiness. Severe financial problems encountered by its customers could limit Enable's ability to collect amounts owed to it, or to enforce performance of obligations under contractual arrangements. In addition, many of Enable's customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. The combination of reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities and\nthe lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction of its customers' liquidity and limit its customers' ability to make payments or perform on obligations to Enable. Furthermore, some of Enable's customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to Enable. Financial problems experienced by its customers could result in the impairment of its assets, reduction of its operating cash flows and may also reduce or curtail its customers' future use of its products and services, which could reduce revenues.\nEnable provides certain transportation and storage services under fixed-price \"negotiated rate\" contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if the cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts, and, as a result, costs could exceed revenues received under such contracts.\nEnable has been authorized by the FERC to provide transportation and storage services at its facilities at negotiated rates. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 44 percent of Enable's aggregate contracted firm transportation capacity on EGT and MRT and 45 percent of its aggregate contracted firm storage capacity on EGT and MRT was subscribed under such \"negotiated rate\" contracts. These contracts generally do not include provisions allowing for adjustment for increased costs due to inflation, pipeline safety activities or other factors that are not tied to an applicable tracking mechanism authorized by the FERC. Successful recovery of any shortfall of revenue, representing the difference between \"recourse rates\" (if higher) and negotiated rates, is not assured under current FERC policies. If Enable's costs increase and it is not able to recover any shortfall of revenue associated with its negotiated rate contracts, the cash flow realized by its systems could decrease and, therefore, the cash Enable has available for distribution to its unitholders, including us, could also decrease.\nIf third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to Enable's gathering, processing or transportation facilities become partially or fully unavailable to Enable for any reason, Enable's financial position, results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions to us could be adversely affected.\nEnable depends upon (i) third-party pipelines to deliver natural gas to, and take natural gas from, its natural gas transportation systems, (ii) third-party pipelines and other facilities to take crude oil from its crude oil gathering systems, and, in some cases, (iii) third-party facilities to process natural gas from its gathering systems. It also depends on third-party facilities to transport and fractionate NGLs that are delivered to the third party at the tailgates of its processing plants. Fractionation is the separation of the heterogeneous mixture of extracted NGLs into individual components for end-use sale. For example, an outage or disruption on certain pipelines or fractionators operated by a third party could result in the shutdown of certain of Enable's processing plants and gathering systems, and a prolonged outage or disruption could ultimately result in a reduction in the volume of natural gas Enable gathers and NGLs it is able to produce. Additionally, Enable depends on third parties to provide electricity for compression at many of its facilities. Since it does not own or operate any of these third-party pipelines or other facilities, continuing operation of those facilities is not within its control. If any of these third-party pipelines or other facilities become partially or fully unavailable to Enable for any reason, its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us, could be adversely affected.\nEnable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt its operations.\nEnable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities have been constructed, and it is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid rights-of-way or if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate. Enable may obtain the rights to construct and operate its pipelines for a specific period of time on lands owned by governmental agencies, American Indian tribes or other third parties, including on American Indian allotments, title to which is held in trust by the U.S. A loss of these rights, through its inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could cause a cease in operations temporarily or permanently on the affected land, increase costs related to the construction and continuing operations elsewhere, and adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us.\nEnable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures, which subjects them to additional risks that could adversely affect the success of its operations and financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us.\nEnable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures with third parties, including Enbridge Inc., DCP Midstream Partners, LP, CVR Refining, LP, Trans Louisiana Gas Pipeline, Inc. and Pablo Gathering, LLC. It may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future. These third parties may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as the obligation to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture. The performance of these third-party obligations, including the ability of the third parties to satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, is outside the control of Enable. If these parties do not satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, Enable's business may be adversely affected.\nThe joint venture arrangements of Enable may involve risks not otherwise present when operating assets directly, including, for example:\n\u2022\njoint venture partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions;\n\u2022\njoint venture partners may not pay their share of the obligations, leaving Enable liable for the liabilities created as a result of those unpaid obligations;\n\u2022\npossible inability to control the amount of cash it will receive from the joint venture;\n\u2022\nit may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by its joint venture partners;\n\u2022\nit may be required to devote significant management time to the requirements of and matters relating to the joint ventures;\n\u2022\nits insurance policies may not fully cover loss or damage incurred by both them and its joint venture partners in certain circumstances;\n\u2022\nits joint venture partners may be in a position to take actions contrary to its instructions or requests or contrary to its policies or objectives; and\n\u2022\ndisputes between them and its joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses.\nThe risks described above or the failure to continue joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with joint venture partners could adversely affect Enable's ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture, which would in turn adversely affect its financial position and results of operations ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us. The agreements under which certain joint ventures were formed may subject them to various risks, limit the actions it may take with respect to the assets subject to the joint venture and require them to grant rights to its joint venture partners that could limit its ability to benefit fully from future positive developments. Some joint ventures require Enable to make significant capital expenditures. If it does not timely meet its financial commitments or otherwise do not comply with its joint venture agreements, its rights to participate, exercise operator rights or otherwise influence or benefit from the joint venture may be adversely affected. Certain of its joint venture partners may have substantially greater financial resources than Enable has and it may not be able to secure the funding necessary to participate in operations its joint venture partners propose, thereby reducing its ability to benefit from the joint venture.\nUnder certain circumstances, Enbridge Inc. could have the right to purchase an ownership interest in SESH at fair market value.\nEnable owns a 50 percent ownership interest in SESH. The remaining 50 percent ownership interests are held by Enbridge Inc. As of December 31, 2018, CenterPoint owns a 54.0 percent of Enable's common units, 100.0 percent of its Series A Preferred Units and a 40 percent economic interest in Enable GP, LLC. Pursuant to the terms of the limited liability company agreement of SESH, as amended (the SESH LLC Agreement), if, at any time, CenterPoint has a right to receive less than 50 percent of Enable's distributions through its interests in Enable and in the general partner, or does not have the ability to exercise certain control rights, Enbridge Inc. could have the right to purchase Enable's interest in SESH at fair market value, subject to certain exceptions.\nAn impairment of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, equity method investments or goodwill could reduce Enable's earnings.\nLong-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment of long-lived assets is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.\nEquity method investments are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment might not be recoverable. An impairment of an equity method investment is recognized if the fair value of the investment as a whole, and not the underlying assets, has declined and the decline is other than temporary. An example of an investment that Enable accounts for under the equity method is its investment in SESH. If Enable enters into additional joint ventures, it could have additional equity method investments.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis as well as when events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit to below its carrying amount. An impairment of goodwill is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value and the carrying amount of that reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied value of that goodwill. As of December 31, 2018, Enable has goodwill of $98 million as a result of the acquisitions of Velocity Holdings, LLC in the fourth quarter of 2018 and Align Midstream, LLC in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nEnable could experience future events or circumstances that result in an impairment of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, equity method investments, or goodwill. If Enable recognizes an impairment, it would take an immediate non-\ncash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization. As a result, an impairment could have an adverse effect on Enable's results of operations and its ability to satisfy the financial ratios or other covenants under its existing or future debt agreements.\nEnable's business involves many hazards and operational risks, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations or ability to make cash distributions to us.\nEnable's operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in the gathering, processing, transportation and storage of natural gas and crude oil, including:\n\u2022\ndamage to pipelines and plants, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, earthquakes and other natural disasters, acts of terrorism and actions by third parties;\n\u2022\ninadvertent damage from construction, vehicles and farm and utility equipment;\n\u2022\nleaks of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and other hydrocarbons or losses of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities;\n\u2022\nruptures, fires and explosions; and\n\u2022\nother hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations.\nThese risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage. These risks may also result in curtailment or suspension of its operations. A natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which it operates could adversely affect Enable's results of operations. Enable is not fully insured against all risks inherent in its business. Enable currently has general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of its facilities in amounts that it considers appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles. Enable has business interruption insurance coverage for some but not all of its operations. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of Enable's facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without adversely affecting its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nThe use of derivative contracts by Enable and its subsidiaries in the normal course of business could result in financial losses that could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us.\nEnable and its subsidiaries periodically use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage its commodity and financial market risks. Enable and its subsidiaries could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts, or should a counterparty fail to perform. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact Enable's results of operations.\nEnable's business is dependent on its ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skill sets to future needs, competition for skilled labor or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Enable's costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect Enable's ability to manage and operate its business. If Enable is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, its results of operations could be negatively affected.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Enable has 90 employees who are participants under OGE Energy Corp.'s defined benefit and retiree medical plans, who are seconded to the Partnership, subject to certain termination rights of the Partnership and OGE Energy Corp. If seconding is terminated, employees of OGE Energy Corp. that Enable determines to hire are under no obligation to accept Enable's offer of employment on the terms Enable provides, or at all.\nEnable's ability to grow is dependent in part on its ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms.\nEnable expects its operating subsidiaries will distribute all of their available cash to Enable and that it will distribute all of its available cash to its unitholders. As a result, Enable expects that it and its operating subsidiaries will rely significantly upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. To the extent Enable or its operating subsidiaries are unable to finance growth externally or through internally generated cash flows, Enable's and its operating subsidiaries' cash distribution policy may significantly impair Enable's and its operating subsidiaries' ability to grow. In addition, because Enable and its operating subsidiaries distribute all available cash, Enable's and its operating subsidiaries' growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations.\nTo the extent Enable issues additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk it will be unable to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level, which in turn may impact the available cash that Enable has to distribute on each unit. There are no limitations in the partnership agreement on its ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt by Enable or its operating subsidiaries to finance its growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which in turn may negatively impact the available cash that its operating subsidiaries have to distribute to it, and thus that it has to distribute to its unitholders, including us.\nEnable depends in part on access to the capital markets and other external financing sources to fund its expansion capital expenditures, although Enable has also increasingly relied on cash flow generated from its operations to fund its expansion capital expenditures. Historically, unit prices of midstream master limited partnerships have experienced periods of volatility. In addition, because Enable's common units are yield-based securities, rising market interest rates could impact the relative attractiveness of its common units to investors. As a result of capital market volatility, Enable may be unable to issue equity or debt on satisfactory terms, or at all, which may limit its ability to expand its operations or make future acquisitions.\nIn the first quarter of 2016, CenterPoint announced that it was evaluating strategic alternatives for its investment in Enable. In the first quarter of 2018, CenterPoint disclosed that it had decided not to pursue a sale or spin-off qualifying under Section 355 of the Code at that time and that, while a transaction for all of its interests in Enable was not viable at that time, it may pursue such a transaction if it becomes viable in the future. CenterPoint also disclosed that it may reduce its investment in Enable through a sale of all or a portion of Enable's common units it owns in the public equity markets or otherwise, subject to certain limitations. CenterPoint's disclosure, as well as any sales by CenterPoint of the common units it holds in the public equity markets, could have an adverse impact on the market for Enable common units, including Enable's ability to issue equity on favorable terms to fund Enable's capital needs or at all.\nEnable's merger and acquisition activities may not be successful or may result in completed acquisitions that do not perform as anticipated, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations or future growth.\nFrom time to time, Enable has made, and it intends to continue to make, acquisitions of businesses and assets. Such acquisitions involve substantial risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nacquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;\n\u2022\nacquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate;\n\u2022\nit may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to it, that exceed its estimates, or for which its rights to indemnification from the seller are limited;\n\u2022\nit may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; and\n\u2022\nacquisitions, or the pursuit of acquisitions, could disrupt its ongoing businesses, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain its current business standards, controls and procedures.\nIn addition, Enable's growth strategy includes, in part, the ability to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms. If Enable is unable to make acquisitions or if its acquisitions do not perform as anticipated, Enable's future growth may be adversely affected.\nEnable and its operating subsidiaries' debt levels may limit their flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Enable had approximately $2.9 billion of long-term debt outstanding, excluding the premiums, discounts and unamortized debt expense on senior notes. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, Enable had $649.0 million outstanding under its commercial paper program and $500.0 million outstanding under its 2019 notes, excluding unamortized debt expense. Enable also has a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other partnership purposes, including acquisitions, with approximately $250.0 million in borrowings outstanding and $848.0 million remaining available as of February 1, 2019. Enable has the ability to incur additional debt, subject to limitations in its credit facilities. The levels of debt could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\na portion of cash flows will be required to make interest payments on the debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions;\n\u2022\nthe debt level will make Enable more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in the business or the economy generally; and\n\u2022\nthe debt level may limit flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.\nEnable's and its operating subsidiaries' ability to service their debt will depend upon, among other things, its future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, commodity prices and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond its control. If operating results are not sufficient to service Enable's and its operating subsidiaries' current or future indebtedness, Enable and its subsidiaries may be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. These actions may not be effected on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nEnable's credit facilities contain operating and financial restrictions, including covenants and restrictions that may be affected by events beyond its control, which could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEnable's credit facilities contain customary covenants that, among other things, limit the ability to:\n\u2022\npermit its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022\nincur or permit to exist certain liens on assets;\n\u2022\ndispose of assets;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with another company or engage in a change of control;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates on non-arm's length terms; and\n\u2022\nchange the nature of its business.\nEnable's credit facilities also require it to maintain certain financial ratios. Its ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond its control, and assurance it will meet those ratios cannot be guaranteed. In addition, its credit facilities contain events of default customary for agreements of this nature.\nEnable's ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its credit facilities may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, its ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in its credit facilities is violated, a significant portion of its indebtedness may become immediately due and payable. In addition, its lenders' commitments to make further loans to Enable under the revolving credit facility may be suspended or terminated. Enable might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.\nAffiliates of Enable's general partner, including CenterPoint and the Company, may compete with Enable, and neither the general partner nor its affiliates have any obligation to present business opportunities to Enable.\nUnder Enable's omnibus agreement, both CenterPoint and the Company are prohibited from, directly or indirectly, owning, operating, acquiring or investing in any business engaged in midstream operations located within the U.S., other than through Enable. This requirement applies to both CenterPoint and the Company for so long as either CenterPoint or the Company holds any interest in Enable's general partner or at least 20 percent of its common units. However, if CenterPoint or the Company acquires any business with midstream operations assets that have a value in excess of $50.0 million (or $100.0 million in the aggregate\nwith such party's other acquired midstream operations assets that have not been offered to Enable), the acquiring party will be required to offer to Enable such assets for such value. If Enable does not purchase such assets, the acquiring party will be free to retain and operate such midstream assets, so long as the value of the assets does not reach certain thresholds.\nAs a result, under the circumstances described above, CenterPoint and the Company have the ability to construct or acquire assets that directly compete with Enable's assets. Pursuant to the terms of Enable's partnership agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, does not apply to Enable's general partner or any of its affiliates, including its executive officers and directors and CenterPoint and the Company. Any such person or entity that becomes aware of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for Enable will not have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to Enable. Any such person or entity will not be liable to Enable or to any limited partner for breach of any fiduciary duty or other duty by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another person or entity or does not communicate such opportunity or information to Enable. This may create actual and potential conflicts of interest between Enable and affiliates of its general partner and result in less than favorable treatment of Enable and its common unitholders.\nIf Enable fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, then it may not be able to accurately report financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential unitholders could lose confidence in its financial reporting, which would harm Enable's business and the trading price of its common units.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for Enable to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If its efforts to maintain an effective system of internal controls are not successful, it is unable to maintain adequate controls over its financial processes and reporting in the future or it is unable to comply with its obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, its operating results could be harmed or fail to meet its reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in its reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of Enable's common units.\nCybersecurity attacks or other disruptions of Enable's systems, networks and technology could adversely impact Enable's financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us.\nEnable has become increasingly dependent on the systems, networks and technology that it uses to conduct almost all aspects of its business, including the operation of its gathering, processing, transportation and storage assets, the recording of commercial transactions and the reporting of financial information. Enable depends on both its own systems, networks and technology as well as the systems, networks and technology of its vendors, customers and other business partners. Any disruption of these systems, networks and technology could disrupt the operation of Enable's business. Disruptions can result from a variety of causes, including natural disasters, the failure of software or equipment and manmade events, such as cybersecurity attacks or information security breaches. Cybersecurity attacks and information security breaches could result in the unauthorized use of confidential, proprietary or other information and in the disruption of Enable's critical business functions and operations, adversely affecting its reputation and subjecting it to possible legal claims and liability. In addition, Enable is not fully insured against all cybersecurity risks.\nAs cybersecurity attacks continue to evolve, Enable may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cybersecurity attacks. In particular, Enable's implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for its personnel, information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. To date Enable has not experienced any material losses relating to cybersecurity attacks; however, there can be no assurance that it will not suffer such losses in the future. Consequently, it is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could adversely affect Enable's financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us.\nTerrorist attacks or other physical security threats could adversely affect Enable's business.\nEnable's gathering, processing, transportation and storage assets may be targets of terrorist activities or other physical security threats that could disrupt its ability to conduct its business. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could adversely affect Enable's financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us. In addition, any physical damage to Enable's assets resulting from acts of terrorism may not be fully covered by Enable's insurance.\nEnable may be unable to obtain or renew permits necessary for its operations, which could inhibit its ability to do business.\nPerformance of its operations require it obtain and maintain a number of federal and state permits, licenses and approvals with terms and conditions containing a significant number of prescriptive limits and performance standards in order to operate. All of these permits, licenses, approval limits and standards require a significant amount of monitoring, record keeping and reporting in order to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit, license, approval limit or standard. Noncompliance or incomplete documentation of Enable's compliance status may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive relief. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay the issuance of a new or existing material permit or other approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or other approval, could adversely affect its ability to initiate or continue operations at the affected location or facility and on its financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us.\nAdditionally, in order to obtain permits and renewals of permits and other approvals in the future, Enable may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the potential adverse impact that any proposed pipeline or processing-related activities may have on the environment, individually or in the aggregate, including on public and American Indian tribal lands. Certain approval procedures may require preparation of archaeological surveys, wetland delineations, endangered species surveys and other studies to assess the environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites. Compliance with these regulatory requirements may be expensive and may significantly lengthen the time required to prepare applications and to receive authorizations and consequently could disrupt Enable's project construction schedules.\nCosts of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations are significant, and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect Enable's financial position, results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us.\nEnable is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, wildlife conservation, natural resources and health and safety that could, among other things, delay or increase costs of construction, restrict or limit the output of certain facilities and/or require additional pollution control equipment and otherwise increase costs. For instance, in May 2016, the EPA issued final standards governing methane emissions imposing more stringent controls on methane and volatile organic compounds emissions at new and modified oil and natural gas production, processing, storage and transmission facilities. These rules have required changes to Enable's operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions. Following the change in presidential administrations, there have been attempts to modify these regulations, and litigation concerning the regulations is ongoing. As a result, Enable cannot predict the scope of any final methane regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements. However, several states are pursuing similar measures to regulate emissions of methane from new and existing sources. There are significant capital, operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules and regulations. Future federal and state regulations relating to Enable's gathering and processing, transmission and storage operations remain a possibility and could result in increased compliance costs on Enable's operations. Furthermore, if new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions are adopted in areas where Enable's oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, they could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells, some or all of which could adversely affect demand for Enable's services to those customers.\nThere is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in Enable's operations due to the handling of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and produced water as well as air emissions related to its operations and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. These matters are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, including the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of plants, wildlife, and natural and cultural resources. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact business activities in many ways, such as restricting the handling or disposing of wastes or requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions that may be caused by its operations or that are attributable to former operators. Joint and several strict liability may be incurred, without regard to fault, under certain of these environmental laws and regulations in connection with discharges or releases of wastes on, under or from its properties and facilities, many of which have been used for midstream activities for a number of years, oftentimes by third parties not under its control. Private parties, including the owners of the properties through which its gathering and transportation systems pass and facilities where its wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance, as well as to seek damages for non- compliance, with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. For example, an accidental release from one of its pipelines could subject them to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. Enable may be unable to recover these costs from insurance. Moreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. Further, stricter\nrequirements could negatively impact its customers' production and operations, resulting in less demand for its services.\nIncreased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and waste water injection wells could result in reductions or delays in natural gas production by Enable's customers, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nHydraulic fracturing is a common practice that is used by many of Enable's customers to stimulate production of natural gas and crude oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. In addition, certain federal agencies have proposed additional laws and regulations to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. In past sessions, Congress has considered, but not passed, legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. The EPA has issued regulations and guidance for hydraulic fracturing operations under several statutes.\nSome states have adopted, and other states have considered adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular, in some cases banning hydraulic fracturing entirely. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where Enable's oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, they could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells, some or all of which activities could adversely affect demand for Enable's services to those customers.\nState and federal regulatory agencies have also focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity. Similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In March 2016, the U.S. Geological Survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico and Arkansas. In March 2017, the U.S. Geological Survey produced an updated seismic hazard survey that forecasted lower earthquake rates in regions of induced activity but still showed significantly elevated hazards in the central and eastern U.S. In light of these concerns, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity. For example, the OCC has implemented volume reduction plans, and at times required shut-ins, for disposal wells injecting wastewater from oil and gas operations into the Arbuckle formation. In February 2018, the OCC revised well completion seismicity guidelines for operators in the South Central Oklahoma Oil Province and the Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties to reduce the threshold of seismic readings required to suspend hydraulic fracturing operations in some circumstances. Certain environmental and other groups have also suggested that additional federal, state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. Enable cannot predict whether additional federal, state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs for Enable's customers, which in turn could reduce the demand for Enable's services.\nOther governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act or other regulatory mechanisms.\nEnable may incur substantial liabilities to comply with climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives.\nBecause Enable's operations emit various types of greenhouse gases, legislation and regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions could increase its costs related to operating and maintaining its facilities, and could delay future permitting. At the federal level, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, require the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production sources in the U.S. on an annual basis, which include certain of Enable's operations. Additional rules, such as the updates to the oil and gas new source performance standard requirements finalized by the EPA in May 2016, could affect Enable's ability to obtain air permits for new or modified facilities or require its operations to incur additional expenses to control air emissions by installing emissions control technologies and adhering to a variety of work practice and other requirements. Following the change in presidential administrations, there have been attempts to modify these regulations, and litigation concerning the regulations is\nongoing. As a result, Enable cannot predict the scope of any final methane regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements. If upheld, these requirements could increase the costs of development and production, reducing the profits available to Enable and potentially impair its operator's ability to economically develop its properties.\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress has in the past and may in the future consider legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. Efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues. From time to time, the U.S. Congress has considered adopting legislation to limit greenhouse gases emissions. A number of state and regional efforts have also emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing greenhouse gas emissions by means of cap and trade programs. These programs typically require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those greenhouse gas emissions. Any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases could require Enable to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Substantial limitations on greenhouse gas emissions could also adversely affect demand for oil and natural gas. Depending on the particular program, Enable could in the future be required to purchase and surrender emission allowances or otherwise undertake measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Any additional costs or operating restrictions associated with new legislation or regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect the demand for Enable's services and its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us.\nIncreased regulatory-imposed costs may also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the products that Enable gathers, treats and transports. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that oil and gas will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040, and other private sector studies project continued growth in demand for the next two decades.\nFinally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could adversely affect Enable's results of operations.\nEnable's operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal regulatory authorities. Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nThe rates charged by several of Enable's pipeline systems, including interstate gas transportation service provided by its intrastate pipelines, are regulated by the FERC. The FERC and state regulatory agencies also regulate other terms and conditions of the services it may offer. If one of these regulatory agencies, on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties, were to lower its tariff rates or deny any rate increase or other material changes to the types or terms and conditions of service it might propose or offer, the profitability of its pipeline businesses could suffer. If it were permitted to raise its tariff rates for a particular pipeline, there might be significant delay between the time the tariff rate increase is approved and the time that the rate increase actually goes into effect, which could also limit profitability. Furthermore, competition from other pipeline systems may prevent them from raising its tariff rates even if permitted by regulatory agencies. The regulatory agencies that regulate its systems periodically implement new rules, regulations and terms and conditions of services subject to its jurisdiction. New initiatives or orders may adversely affect the rates charged for services or otherwise adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEnable's natural gas interstate pipelines are regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Generally, the FERC's authority over interstate natural gas transportation extends to:\n\u2022\nrates, operating terms, conditions of service and service contracts;\n\u2022\ncertification and construction of new facilities;\n\u2022\nextension or abandonment of services and facilities or expansion of existing facilities;\n\u2022\nmaintenance of accounts and records;\n\u2022\nacquisition and disposition of facilities;\n\u2022\ninitiation and discontinuation of services;\n\u2022\ndepreciation and amortization policies;\n\u2022\nconduct and relationship with certain affiliates;\n\u2022\nmarket manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases or natural gas transportation; and\n\u2022\nvarious other matters.\nShould Enable fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, it could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC has civil penalty authority under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 to impose penalties for current violations of up to approximately $1.3 million per day for each violation and possible criminal penalties of up to approximately $1.3 million per violation.\nThe FERC's jurisdiction extends to the certification and construction of interstate transportation and storage facilities, including, but not limited to expansions, lateral and other facilities and abandonment of facilities and services. Prior to commencing construction of significant new interstate transportation and storage facilities, an interstate pipeline must obtain a certificate authorizing the construction, or an order amending its existing certificate, from the FERC. Certain minor expansions are authorized by blanket certificates that the FERC has issued by rule. Typically, a significant expansion project requires review by a number of governmental agencies, including state and local agencies, whose cooperation is important in completing the regulatory process on schedule. Any failure by an agency to issue sufficient authorizations or permits in a timely manner for one or more of these projects may mean that Enable will not be able to pursue these projects or that they will be constructed in a manner or with capital requirements that Enable did not anticipate. Enable's inability to obtain sufficient permits and authorizations in a timely manner could materially and negatively impact the additional revenues expected from these projects.\nThe FERC conducts audits to verify compliance with the FERC's regulations and the terms of its orders, including whether the websites of interstate pipelines accurately provide information on the operations and availability of services. The FERC's regulations require uniform terms and conditions for service, as set forth in agreements for transportation and storage services executed between interstate pipelines and their customers. These service agreements are required to conform, in all material respects, with the standard form of service agreements set forth in the pipeline's FERC-approved tariff. Non-conforming agreements must be filed with, and accepted by, the FERC. In the event that the FERC finds that an agreement, in whole or part, is materially non-conforming, it could reject the agreement or require Enable to seek modification, or alternatively require Enable to modify its tariff so that the non-conforming provisions are generally available to all customers.\nThe rates, terms and conditions for transporting natural gas in interstate commerce on certain of Enable's intrastate pipelines and for services offered at certain of Enable's storage facilities are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act. Rates to provide such interstate transportation service must be \"fair and equitable\" under the Natural Gas Policy Act and are subject to review, refund with interest if found not to be fair and equitable, and approval by the FERC at least once every five years.\nEnable's crude oil gathering systems in the Williston Basin are subject to common carrier regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act. The Interstate Commerce Act requires that Enable maintain tariffs on file with the FERC setting forth the rates Enable charges for providing transportation services, as well as the rules and regulations governing such services. The Interstate Commerce Act also requires, among other things, that Enable's rates must be \"just and reasonable\" and that Enable provide service in a manner that is nondiscriminatory. Shippers on Enable's FERC-regulated crude oil gathering systems may protest its tariff filings, file complaints against its existing rates, or the FERC can investigate Enable's rates on its own initiative. If FERC finds that Enable's existing or proposed rates are unjust and unreasonable, it could deny requested rate increases or could order Enable to reduce its rates and could require the payment of reparations to complaining shippers for up to two years prior to the complaint.\nOn December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was enacted, which reduced the highest marginal U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. In a series of related issuances in 2018, the FERC revised its policy so that it will no longer permit pipelines organized as master limited partnerships to recover an income tax allowance in their cost-of-service rates and proposed rules for implementing this revised policy and the corporate income tax rate reduction pursuant to the 2017 Tax Act with respect to natural gas pipeline rates. In July 2018, the FERC denied requests for rehearing of the policy statement relating to recovery of an income tax allowance (although it indicated that a master limited partnership will not be precluded in a future proceeding from arguing and providing evidentiary support that it is entitled to an income tax allowance and demonstrating that its recovery of an income tax allowance does not result in a double-recovery of investors' income tax costs). Also in July 2018, the FERC adopted proposed rules that require all FERC-regulated natural gas pipelines that have cost-based rates for service to make a one-time Form No. 501-G filing providing certain financial information that will allow the FERC and other stakeholders to evaluate the impacts of the revised policy and the corporate income tax rate reduction on each individual pipeline's rates, and to select one of four options: file a limited Natural Gas Act of 1938 Section 4 filing reducing its rates only as required related to the revised policy and the 2017 Tax Act, commit to filing a general Natural Gas Act of 1938 Section 4 rate case in the near future, file a statement explaining why an adjustment to rates is not needed, or take no other action. EGT filed its Form No. 501-G on October 11, 2018 and explained why a reduction to rates is not warranted. On November 8, 2018, SESH filed its Form No. 501-G and indicated it contemporaneously filed a limited Section 4 rate reduction filing as required by the rules described above. As MRT had already filed a rate proceeding under Natural Gas Act of 1938 Section\n4 pursuant to a schedule agreed upon in the settlement of MRT's last rate case, MRT was not required to make any filing on the FERC's Form No. 501-G.\nThe FERC's revised policy statement requires the reduced maximum corporate tax rate to be reflected in initial oil cost-of-service rates and cost-of-service rate changes going forward and in future filings of Page 700 of FERC Form No. 6. The FERC will consider the information provided by pipelines in Page 700 of FERC Form No. 6 in its 2020 five-year review of the oil pipeline index level.\nAlthough Enable cannot predict the ultimate impact of the policy statement and final rules, the cost-of-service rates Enable is permitted to charge their customers for transportation and storage services could be impacted when MRT or if EGT files a limited or general Natural Gas Act of 1938 Section 4 rate filing or if the FERC or customers challenge the cost-of-service rates that EGT is authorized to charge. Enable also cannot predict the outcome of the 2020 oil pipeline index five-year review, but the rates Enable is permitted to charge its customers for cost-of-service based crude oil transportation services could be impacted. If the FERC requires Enable to establish new tariff rates for either Enable's natural gas or crude oil pipelines that reflect a lower federal corporate income tax rate and the revised policy statement, it is possible the rates would be reduced, which could adversely affect Enable's financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to Enable's unitholders, including us.\nEnable's operations may also be subject to regulation by state and local regulatory authorities. Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us.\nThe pipeline operations of Enable that are not regulated by the FERC may be subject to state and local regulation applicable to intrastate natural gas and transportation services. State and local regulations generally focus on safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, prohibition of undue discrimination among shippers. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered and, in some instances, adopted from time to time. The effect, if any, such changes might have on operations cannot be predicted, but Enable could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes. Other state and local regulations also may affect the business. Any such state or local regulation could have an adverse effect on the business and the financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us.\nA change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of Enable's assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of its assets, which may cause its revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase.\nEnable's natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation systems are generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the FERC under the Natural Gas Act, and its crude oil gathering system in the Anadarko Basin is generally exempt from the jurisdiction of FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act. Nevertheless, FERC regulation may indirectly impact these businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses. The FERC's policies and practices across the range of its oil and natural gas regulatory activities, including, for example, its policies on interstate open access transportation, ratemaking, capacity release, and market center promotion may indirectly affect intrastate markets. In recent years, the FERC has pursued pro-competitive policies in its regulation of interstate oil and natural gas pipelines. However, it cannot be assured that the FERC will continue to pursue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may indirectly affect the intrastate natural gas transportation business. Although the FERC has not made a formal determination with respect to all of Enable's facilities it considers to be engaged in natural gas gathering or a formal determination with respect to its facilities that it considers to be engaged in intrastate crude oil gathering, Enable believes that its natural gas gathering facilities meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a natural gas gathering pipeline and Enable's intrastate crude oil gathering facilities meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is not engaged in interstate crude oil transportation. The distinction between FERC-regulated facilities, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and the FERC determines whether facilities are subject to regulation under the Natural Gas Act or the Interstate Commerce Act on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of its facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts or Congress. If the FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility and/or services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the FERC. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect Enable's financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders, including us. In addition, if any of Enable's facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the Natural Gas Act, Natural Gas Policy Act or Interstate Commerce Act regulations, this could result in the imposition of substantial civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge revenues collected for such services in excess of the maximum rates established by the FERC.\nNatural gas gathering and intrastate crude oil gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level; therefore, these operations could be adversely affected should it become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services. Enable's gathering operations could also be subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design, construction, testing, operation, replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities. The effect, if any, such changes might have on its operations cannot be predicted, but additional capital expenditures could be required and increased costs could be incurred depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.\nEnable may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from compliance with pipeline safety laws and regulations, pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs.\nCertain of Enable's pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations. The U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration regulates safety requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of its jurisdictional natural gas and hazardous liquids pipeline facilities. All of Enable's interstate and intrastate natural gas transportation pipeline facilities are Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration jurisdictional and certain of Enable's natural gas gathering, NGLs and crude oil pipeline facilities are Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration jurisdictional. Among other things, these laws and regulations require pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures, for pipelines located in \u201chigh consequence areas.\u201d The regulations require operators, including Enable, to, among other things:\n\u2022\nperform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;\n\u2022\ndevelop a baseline plan to prioritize the assessment of a covered pipeline segment;\n\u2022\nidentify and characterize applicable threats that could impact a high consequence area;\n\u2022\nimprove data collection, integration, and analysis;\n\u2022\nrepair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and\n\u2022\nimplement preventive and mitigating action.\nFailure to comply with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration or comparable state pipeline safety regulations could result in a number of consequences which may have an adverse effect on Enable's operations. Enable incurs significant costs associated with its compliance with existing Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and comparable state pipeline regulations. Enable incurred maintenance capital expenditures and operation and maintenance expenses of $54.0 million in 2018 and currently estimates that it will incur maintenance capital expenditures and operation and maintenance expenses of up to $65.0 million in 2019 under its pipeline safety program, including costs related to integrity assessments and repairs, threat and risk analyses, implementing preventative and mitigative measures, and conducting activities to support the maximum allowable operating pressure for gas pipelines or the maximum operating pressure for hazardous liquid pipelines. Enable may incur significant cost associated with repair, remediation, preventive and mitigation measures associated with its integrity management programs for pipelines that are not currently subject to regulation by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.\nChanges to pipeline safety regulations occur frequently. For example, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration is expected to publish finalized regulations in 2019, for both gas and hazardous liquids pipelines, that will significantly extend and expand the reach of certain Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration integrity management requirements (i.e., period assessments, leak detection and repairs) regardless of proximity to a high consequence area. The final rules will also impose new requirements for certain unregulated pipelines, including gathering lines. The adoption of new regulations requiring more comprehensive or stringent safety standards could require Enable to install new or modified safety controls, pursue new capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, all of which could require Enable to incur increased and potentially significant operational costs.\nFinancial reform regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act could adversely affect Enable's ability to use derivative instruments to hedge risks associated with its business.\nAt times, Enable may hedge all or a portion of its commodity risk and its interest rate risk. The federal government regulates the derivatives markets and entities, including businesses like Enable, that participate in those market through the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the legislation. Under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's regulations, Enable is subject to reporting and recordkeeping obligations for transactions involving non-financial swap transactions the Commodity Futures Trading Commissions initially adopted regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents, but these rules were successfully challenged in federal district court by the Securities Industry Financial Markets Association and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and largely vacated by the court. In December 2013, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission published a notice of proposed rulemaking designed to implement new position limits regulation and in December 2016, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's re-proposed regulations for position limits. The ultimate form and timing of the implementation of the regulatory regime affecting commodity derivatives remains uncertain.\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission has imposed mandatory clearing requirements on certain categories of swaps, including certain interest rate swaps, but has exempted derivatives intended to hedge or mitigate commercial risk from the mandatory swap clearing requirement, where a counterparty such as Enable has required identification number, is not a financial entity as defined by the regulations, and meets a minimum asset test. Enable's management believes its hedging transactions qualify for this \"commercial end-user\" exception. The Dodd-Frank Act may also require Enable to comply with margin requirements in connection with its hedging activities, although the application of those provisions to Enable is uncertain at this time. The Dodd-Frank Act may also require the counterparties to its derivative instruments to spin off some of their hedging activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivatives contracts for Enable's industry (including requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect Enable's available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivatives contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks Enable encounters, reduce its ability to monetize or restructure its existing derivatives contracts, and increase its exposure to less creditworthy counterparties, particularly if Enable is unable to utilize the commercial end user exception with respect to certain of its hedging transactions. If Enable reduces its use of hedging as a result of the legislation and regulations, its results of operations may become more volatile and its cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect its ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures and fund unitholder distributions. Finally, the legislation was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to crude oil and natural gas. Enable's revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us.\nAny reductions in Enable's credit ratings could increase its financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships.\nEnable cannot provide assurance that its credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. If any of Enable's credit ratings are below investment grade, it may have higher future borrowing costs and it or its subsidiaries may be required to post cash collateral or letters of credit under certain contractual agreements. If cash collateral requirements were to occur at a time when Enable was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including us, could be adversely affected.\nEnable's Series A Preferred Units have rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to the rights of, holders of its common units.\nEnable's 10 percent Series A Fixed-to-Floating Non-Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units representing limited partner interests in Enable, issued in February 2016, rank senior to all of its other classes or series of equity securities with respect to distribution rights and rights upon liquidation. Enable cannot declare or pay a distribution to its common unitholders for any quarter unless full distributions have been or contemporaneously are being paid on all outstanding Series A Preferred Units for such quarter. These preferences could adversely affect the cash distributions we receive from Enable or could make it more difficult for Enable to sell its common units in the future.\nHolders of the Series A Preferred Units will receive, on a non-cumulative basis and if and when declared by Enable's general partner, a quarterly cash distribution, subject to certain adjustments, equal to an annual rate of 10 percent on the stated liquidation preference from the date of original issue to, but not including, the five year anniversary of the original issue date, and an annual rate of the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread of 850 basis points on the stated liquidation preference thereafter. In connection with certain transfers of the Series A Preferred Units, the Series A Preferred Units will automatically convert into one or more new series of preferred units (the \"other preferred units\") on the later of the date of transfer or the second anniversary of the date of issue. The other preferred units will have the same terms as Enable's Series A Preferred Units except that unpaid distributions on the other preferred units will accrue from the date of their issuance on a cumulative basis until paid. Enable's Series A Preferred Units are convertible into common units by the holders of such units in certain circumstances. Payment of distributions on Enable's Series A Preferred Units, or on the common units issued following the conversion of such Series A Preferred Units, could impact its liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions, and other general partnership purposes. Enable's obligations to the holders of Series A Preferred Units could also limit its ability to obtain additional financing or increase its borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on its financial condition.\nEnable's Series A Preferred Units contain covenants that may limit its business flexibility.\nEnable's Series A Preferred Units contain covenants preventing it from taking certain actions without the approval of the holders of 66 2/3 percent of the Series A Preferred Units. The need to obtain the approval of holders of the Series A Preferred Units before taking these actions could impede Enable's ability to take certain actions that its management or its board of directors may consider to be in the best interests of its unitholders. The affirmative vote of 66 2/3 percent of the outstanding Series A Preferred Units, voting as a single class, is necessary to amend Enable's Partnership Agreement in any manner that would or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the rights, preferences, obligations or privileges of the Series A Preferred Units. The affirmative vote of 66 2/3 percent of the outstanding Series A Preferred Units and any outstanding series of other preferred units, voting as a single class, is necessary to (A) create or issue certain party securities with proceeds in an aggregate amount in excess of $700.0 million or create or issue any senior securities or (B) subject to Enable's right to redeem the Series A Preferred Units, approve certain fundamental transactions.\nEnable's Series A Preferred Units are required to be redeemed in certain circumstances if they are not eligible for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and Enable may not have sufficient funds to redeem its Series A Preferred Units if it is required to do so.\nThe holders of Enable's Series A Preferred Units may request that Enable list those units for trading on the New York Stock Exchange. If Enable is unable to list the Series A Preferred Units in certain circumstances, it will be required to redeem the Series A Preferred Units. There can be no assurance that Enable would have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy its obligation to redeem the Series A Preferred Units. In addition, mandatory redemption of Enable's Series A Preferred Units could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEnable may issue additional units without the approval of its unitholders, which would dilute unitholders' existing ownership interests.\nEnable's partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests, including limited partner interests that rank senior to the common units, that it may issue at any time without the approval of its unitholders. The issuance by Enable of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:\n\u2022\nEnable's existing unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in Enable will decrease;\n\u2022\nthe amount of distributable cash flow on each unit may decrease;\n\u2022\nbecause the amount payable to holders of incentive distribution rights is based on a percentage of the total distributable cash flow, the distributions to holders of incentive distribution rights will increase even if the per unit distribution on common units remains the same;\n\u2022\nthe ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase;\n\u2022\nthe relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of the common units may decline.\nIn addition, upon a change of control or certain fundamental transactions, Enable's Series A Preferred Units are convertible into common units at the option of the holders of such units. If a substantial portion of the Series A Preferred Units were converted into common units, common unitholders could experience significant dilution. In addition, if holders of such converted Series A Preferred Units were to dispose of a substantial portion of these common units in the public market, whether in a single transaction\nor series of transactions, it could adversely affect the market price for Enable's common units. In addition, these sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, could make it more difficult for Enable to sell its common units in the future.\nAffiliates of Enable's general partner may sell common units in the public or private markets, which could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the common units and may sell their interest in its general partner, which may impact its strategic direction.\nAs of February 1, 2019, CenterPoint held 233,856,623 of Enable's common units and 14,520,000 Series A Preferred Units, and the Company held 110,982,805 of Enable's common units. Enable's Series A Preferred Units are convertible into common units upon a change of control or certain fundamental transactions at the option of the holders of such units. Both Enable's common units held by CenterPoint and the Company, as well as Enable's Series A Preferred Units held by CenterPoint, are subject to certain registration rights. In addition, in the first quarter of 2016, CenterPoint announced that it was evaluating strategic alternatives for its investment in Enable. In the first quarter of 2018, CenterPoint disclosed that it had decided not to pursue a sale or spin-off qualifying under Section 355 of the Code at that time and that, while a transaction for all of its interests in Enable was not viable at that time, it may pursue such a transaction if it becomes viable in the future. CenterPoint also disclosed that it may reduce its investment in Enable through a sale of all or a portion of Enable's common units it owns in the public equity markets or otherwise, subject to certain limitations. While there can be no assurances that these evaluations will result in any specific action, CenterPoint's disclosure, as well as any sales by CenterPoint of the common units it holds in the public or equity markets, could have an adverse impact on the market for Enable's common units, including its ability to issue equity on favorable terms to fund its capital needs or at all. Any sale of Enable's general partner by CenterPoint or the Company may impact Enable's strategic direction, business or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 24440, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "OGE"}
