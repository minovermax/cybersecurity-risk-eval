In addition, this Annual Report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should carefully read the section \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d.\nIf any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could materially decline.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur focus on our online advertising-supported business model involves significant risks.\nGrowth in our advertising revenues depends on our ability to maintain and expand our existing relationships with advertisers and publishers and our ability to develop new relationships with other advertisers and publishers. Growth in our advertising revenues also depends on our ability to continue offering effective products and services for advertisers and publishers. As the advertising market generates and develops new concepts and technology, we may incur additional costs to implement more effective products and services. As programmatic advertising gains traction with more advertisers and publishers, we continue to invest in and focus on our end-to-end open technology and programmatic platforms. Continuing to develop and improve these products and services may require significant time and additional investment. If we cannot continue to develop and improve our advertising products, services and technologies in a timely and cost-effective fashion, our competitive position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe commercial attractiveness of the programmatic advertising solutions that we offer to publishers and advertisers depends on a variety of complex and evolving factors, among them the successful integration of various components of our tech stack including technology and platforms from our recent acquisitions, the continued effective functioning and improvement of our proprietary learning algorithms, the continued ability to access and utilize relevant data about consumers and their consumption habits across multiple devices and, with respect to programmatic advertising exchange-related activities, continued automated access to the advertising inventory and application programming interfaces of publishers as well as continued robust relationships with brand advertisers and agencies.\nOur programmatic advertising solutions may become less attractive, and our results of operations may suffer, as a result of changes in laws and regulations and changes in industry standards generally. In addition, the following factors may further diminish the appeal of our programmatic advertising solutions and thereby negatively affect our results of operations: with respect to the availability of consumer data, changes in consumer choices; with respect to the functioning of our algorithms, the failure or inability to access, collect or analyze relevant data (for technological reasons or otherwise); and with respect to programmatic exchange activities, access to publisher inventory and relationships with advertisers and agencies, technological limitations or restrictions imposed by advertisers and publishers themselves.\nIn order for us to increase advertising revenues in the future, we believe it will be important to increase our overall volume of advertising sold and to maintain or increase pricing for advertising. If we are not able to attract consumers to, and engage consumers with, those AOL Properties that typically generate higher-priced and higher-volume advertising, our advertising revenues may not increase even if the aggregate number of consumers on AOL Properties increases and their aggregate engagement increases.\nAdditionally, there are different cost structures within our advertising business. In order to generate display advertising revenues on Third Party Properties, we incur TAC. While a majority of the costs associated with\ngenerating display advertising on Third Party Properties are variable, a majority of costs associated with generating display advertising revenue on AOL Properties are fixed. Therefore, even if we generate higher display advertising revenues on Third Party Properties, because there are lower incremental margins associated with these sales, the increase in our operating income will be less than it would with an equivalent increase in display revenues on AOL Properties.\nAdditionally, advertising revenues are more unpredictable and variable than our subscription revenues, and are more likely to be adversely affected during economic downturns, as spending by advertisers tends to be cyclical in line with general economic conditions.\nWe face intense competition in all aspects of our business.\nThe internet industry, with its low barriers to entry and rapidly shifting consumer tastes, is dynamic and rapidly evolving. Competition among internet companies offering online content, products and services, as well as with traditional offline content and advertising companies which are increasingly offering their own online content, products and services, is intense both domestically and globally and new competitors can quickly emerge. Additionally, as the use of programmatic advertising continues to increase, we compete with companies that have also invested in programmatic platform offerings. As companies integrate into larger, more comprehensive programmatic platforms, new competitors may arise and our business could be adversely affected if we do not continue to invest in, develop and improve our programmatic products and services.\nAs consumers increasingly use mobile devices and as the demand for video content and advertising increases, we compete with other companies in developing and offering mobile and video content and advertising products and services. If consumers, advertisers and publishers do not widely adopt our mobile and video offerings or if we do not generate sufficient revenue from our mobile or video offerings, our competitive position could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, companies offering services to advertisers are increasingly seeking to track individual consumer usage across devices through the use of tracking and data correlation technologies. To the extent companies with a larger audience reach than ours are able to track individual consumer usage in this way and gather data about consumers that is valuable to advertisers, those companies will have a competitive advantage. If we cannot develop and offer effective tracking and data correlation technologies or we do not have access to a sufficient consumer audience, our advertising products and services may not be as valuable to advertisers and publishers and our competitive position and results of operations may be harmed.\nAdditionally, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the long term if we are not able to capitalize on international opportunities, especially as compared to a number of our competitors who maintain an expansive global presence. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling content, products and services or in attracting and retaining consumers, advertisers, publishers and subscribers domestically and internationally, our business could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not continue to develop and offer compelling content, products and services and attract new consumers or maintain the engagement of our existing consumers, our advertising revenues could be adversely affected.\nIn order to attract consumers and maintain or increase engagement on AOL Properties, we believe we must offer compelling content, products and services across all devices, including mobile. Acquiring, developing and offering new content, products and services, as well as new functionality, features and enhanced performance of our existing content, products and services, may require significant investment and time to develop. In addition, consumer tastes are difficult to predict and subject to rapid change.\nIn general, our subscribers are among the most engaged consumers on AOL Properties. As our subscriber base declines, it is advantageous to maintain the engagement of former AOL subscribers and increase the number and\nengagement of other consumers on AOL Properties in order to successfully execute our business model. Additionally, consumer engagement on certain of the AOL Properties, such as AOL.com, has a significant impact on our operating results and we continue to focus on efforts to maintain or increase engagement on those properties. For example, we derive a significant portion of our search advertising revenue from search queries on AOL.com. If we are unable to develop online content, products and services that are attractive and relevant to AOL.com consumers, we may not be able to maintain or increase our existing consumers\u2019 engagement on or attract new consumers to AOL.com and as a result our search advertising revenues may be adversely affected.\nOur subscriber base could decline faster than we currently anticipate which could result in a decrease in our subscription and advertising revenues.\nOur subscriber base has declined and is expected to continue to decline. This decline has been the result of several factors, including the increased availability of high-speed internet broadband connections and attractive bundled offerings by such broadband providers, the fact that a significant amount of online content, products and services has been optimized for use with broadband internet connections and the effects of our strategic shift to focus on generating advertising revenues, which resulted in us essentially eliminating our marketing efforts for our subscription access services and the free availability of the vast majority of our content, products and services. Although we provide many additional products and services as part of our subscription plans, there can be no assurance that our subscribers will value the bundles of services we offer and they may cancel their subscriptions at any time. If any of these factors result in our subscriber base declining faster than we currently anticipate, our subscription and advertising revenues could be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on a third-party search provider.\nWe do not own or control a general web search service or search advertising system. Google is, except in certain limited circumstances, the exclusive provider of web search and search sponsored links on AOL Properties through December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2014, search advertising revenues comprised approximately 21% of our total advertising and other revenues. Changes that Google has made and may unilaterally make in the future to its search service or advertising network, including changes in its policies and guidelines, pricing, algorithms or advertising relationships, could adversely affect our advertising revenues. Additionally, a decline or an unfavorable change in our relationship with Google could materially affect our advertising revenues. In addition, if Google fails to perform its obligations under the search agreement or terminates the terms of the search agreement, it may have an adverse effect on our business.\nUpon expiration of our agreement with Google on December 31, 2015, there can be no assurance that the agreement will be renewed, or, if the agreement is renewed, that we would receive the same revenue share as we do under the current agreement. In addition, there can be no assurance that if we enter into an arrangement with an alternative search provider the terms would be as favorable as those under the current Google agreement. Even if we were to enter into an arrangement with an alternative search provider with terms as or more favorable than those under the current Google agreement, such an arrangement might generate significantly lower search advertising revenues.\nChanges to products, technology and services made by third parties and consumers could adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on many products, technologies and services provided by third parties, including browsers, data and search indexes, in order for consumers to use our content, products and services, as well as to deliver, measure, render and report advertising. Any changes made by these third parties or consumers to functionality, features or settings of these products, technologies and services could adversely affect our business. For example, third parties may develop, and consumers may install, software that is used to block display or search advertisements or delete cookies, or consumers may elect to manually delete cookies more frequently. The widespread adoption of\nproducts and technologies or changes to current products, technologies and services could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on legacy technology infrastructure and a failure to update, scale or replace this technology infrastructure could adversely affect our business.\nWhile we continue our efforts to update our technology infrastructure to minimize costs and maximize efficiencies, many of our products and services are dependent on technology infrastructure that was developed a number of years ago. The technology infrastructure utilized for our consumer offerings and advertising services is highly complex and may not provide satisfactory support as usage increases and products and services expand, change and become more complex in the future. In addition, we incur significant costs operating our business with multiple technology platforms and infrastructure. Updating and replacing our technology infrastructure may be challenging to implement and manage, may take time to test and deploy, may cause us to incur substantial costs and may cause us to suffer data loss or delays or interruptions in service which could adversely affect our business. Competitors with newer technology infrastructure may have greater flexibility and be in a position to respond more quickly than us to new opportunities, which could impact our competitive position in certain markets and adversely affect our business.\nIf we are unable to hire, engage and retain key management and other personnel, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key members of our management team and other personnel. If we do not succeed in retaining and engaging our key employees and in attracting new key personnel, we may be unable to meet our strategic objectives, including maintaining or building our most valuable brands and developing our end-to-end open programmatic platform, and, as a result, our business could be adversely affected. In particular, Tim Armstrong, our CEO, is critical to our overall management, as well as the development of our strategic direction and culture. We do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies.\nIf we cannot effectively distribute our content, products and services, our ability to attract new customers and maintain the engagement of existing consumers could be adversely affected.\nAs the behavior of internet consumers continues to change, distribution of our content, products and services via traditional methods may become less effective, and new distribution strategies may need to be developed. Consumers are increasingly using social networking sites to communicate and to acquire and disseminate information rather than through instant messaging, electronic mail and portals. As consumers migrate towards social networks, we continue to build social elements into our content, products and services in order to make them available on social networks and to attract and engage consumers on our properties, for example by allowing consumers to contribute comments or their own original content. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate our content with such social networking or other new consumer trends. Even if we are able to distribute our content, products and services effectively through social networking or other new or developing distribution channels, this does not assure that we will be able to attract new consumers.\nCurrently, an important distribution channel for AOL Properties is through our subscription services. However, our subscriber base has declined and is expected to continue to decline. This continued decline is likely to reduce the effectiveness of our subscription services as a distribution channel. In addition, certain of our websites, including the AOL home page portal and The Huffington Post, act as valuable distribution channels for other AOL Properties. If we are unable to grow organically by attracting new consumers directly to our content, products and services or if traffic to our portals declines or our portals are less successful as a distribution vehicle for other AOL Properties, we may need to rely on distribution channels that require us to pay significant fees to third parties such as operators of third-party websites, online networks, software companies, device manufacturers, and others to promote or supply our services to their users.\nPreviously, we entered into distribution agreements with computer manufacturers to install our products and services on their personal computers and laptops. We no longer regularly enter into such agreements and as consumers upgrade their hardware, our products and services may not be as easily accessible. Additionally, our products and services may not be compatible on or supported by new hardware. A decline in the traffic and engagement from these consumers could adversely affect our advertising and subscription revenue.\nTo the extent that we cannot generate consumer and advertiser awareness and adoption of our mobile applications, content, products and services, including new forms of internet advertising for mobile and other internet enabled devices, our business could be adversely impacted.\nGlobal consumers are increasingly accessing and using the internet through devices other than personal computers, such as smartphones, tablets and televisions. As consumer usage shifts away from personal computers and laptops, we expect that our ability to grow advertising revenue will become increasingly dependent on our ability to generate revenue from ads on mobile and other internet enabled devices such as set-top boxes (e.g., Roku, Amazon Fire TV). In order for consumers to access and use our content, products and services via these devices, we must continue to ensure that our content, products and services are compatible with such devices. We need to continue to secure arrangements with device manufacturers and carriers to promote prominent and effective distribution of our content, products and services. In addition to placement agreements with wireless carriers and device manufacturers, currently we offer applications directly to consumers for download from AOL Properties, the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, or through other distribution channels. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular mobile operating systems that we do not control, such as Android and iOS. To the extent a manufacturer or access provider makes any changes in these systems or terms of service that decreases our products' functionality, gives preferential treatment to competitive products, or prevents our ability to show ads, this could adversely affect our usage and revenue on mobile devices.\nThe amount of revenues earned in connection with mobile and other internet enabled devices is currently small relative to total advertising revenues. Also, business models in the marketplace seem to be undergoing experimentation and rapid change.\nA disruption or failure of our networks and information systems, the internet or other technology may disrupt our business.\nOur business is heavily dependent on the availability of network and information systems and services, other technologies, including those owned or licensed by third parties, and the internet. Shutdowns or service disruptions caused by events such as criminal activity, sabotage or espionage, computer viruses, hacking and other cyber-security attacks, router disruption, automated attacks such as denial of service attacks, power outages, natural disasters, accidents, terrorism, equipment failure or other events within or outside our control could adversely affect us and our consumers, including loss or compromise of data, service disruption, damage to equipment and data and excessive call volume to call centers. Furthermore, such attacks are not always able to be immediately detected, which means that we may not be in a position to promptly address the attacks or to implement adequate preventative measures. Such events could result in large expenditures necessary to recover data, or repair or replace such networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future. As not all of our systems are fully redundant, some data or systems might not be recoverable after such events. In addition, not all of our systems operate in the same data centers. Significant incidents could result in a disruption of parts of our business, consumer dissatisfaction, damage to our brands, legal costs or liability, and a loss of consumers or revenues.\nIf our network and data security measures are breached, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, consumers and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services and we may incur significant legal and financial costs.\nOur products and services involve the storage and transmission of our consumers\u2019 and customers\u2019 personal and proprietary information in our facilities and on our equipment, networks and corporate systems. Network and data security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information, government enforcement actions and private litigation, remediation costs, increased costs for security measures, loss of revenue, damage to our reputation and potential liability. Network and data security breaches or unauthorized access have resulted in, and may in the future result in, a combination of significant legal and financial costs, increased remediation and other costs, damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products, services and networks that could have an adverse effect on our business. We take steps to prevent unauthorized access to our network and consumer and customer data and corporate systems, however, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently or may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise network and data security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our team members and contractors. We can give no assurance that a future incident could not be caused by events such as criminal activity, sabotage or espionage, computer viruses, hacking and other cyber-security attacks, router disruption, automated attacks such as denial of service attacks, power outages, natural disasters, accidents, terrorism, equipment failure, malware in advertisements, or other events within or outside our control which could adversely affect us and our consumers.\nAs we previously disclosed, we have determined that there was a security incident in 2014 in which there was unauthorized access to information regarding a significant number of user accounts. This information included AOL users\u2019 email addresses, postal addresses, address book contact information, encrypted passwords and encrypted answers to security questions that we ask when a user resets his or her password, as well as certain employee information. We believe that the individuals or entities have used this contact information to send \u201cspoofed\u201d emails that appeared to come from roughly 2% of our email accounts. We have no indication that the encryption on the passwords or on the answers to security questions was broken or that the incident resulted in disclosure of users\u2019 financial information, including debit and credit cards, which is also fully encrypted. Our investigation of the security incident is complete and there is no indication that we have incurred or will incur a material loss associated with the security incident.\nIf we cannot continue to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on patent, copyright, trademark, domain name and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, as well as licenses and other agreements with our employees, consumers, content providers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in the technology, content, products and services used in our operations. These laws and agreements may not guarantee that our intellectual property rights will be protected and our intellectual property rights could be challenged or invalidated. Amendments to or interpretations of U.S. patent laws or new rulings around U.S. patent laws may adversely impact our ability to protect our new technologies, content, products and services and to defend against claims of patent infringement. In addition, such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current industry trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of offerings, decreased traffic and associated revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business. As we acquire and publish more original content, our intellectual property may be increasingly subject to misappropriation by others, and the costs to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may increase. Additionally, as new generic top-level domains launch, we will likely register a significant number of domain names\nand initiate more enforcement actions in order to protect and defend the trademark rights in our brands, and we may incur significant costs as a result.\nWe have been, and may in the future be, subject to claims of intellectual property infringement or tort law violations that could adversely affect our business.\nMany companies (including patent holding companies) and individuals own patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we develop and offer new products, services, and technologies through various distribution channels we may experience an increase in the number of intellectual property claims against us. These claims, whether meritorious or not, may result in litigation, may be time-consuming and costly to resolve, and may require expensive changes in our methods of doing business and/or our content, products and services. These intellectual property infringement claims may require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms or to incur substantial monetary liability. Additionally, these claims may result in our being enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of certain intellectual property and/or our content, products and services, or may require us to cease or significantly alter certain of our operations. The occurrence of any of these events as a result of these claims could result in substantially increased costs, could limit or reduce the number of our offerings to consumers, advertisers, publishers and AOL subscribers, could stifle innovation or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nSome of our commercial agreements may require us to indemnify third parties against intellectual property infringement claims, which may require us to use substantial resources to defend against or settle such claims or, potentially, to pay damages. These third parties may also discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business. Additionally, we may be exposed to liability or substantially increased costs if a commercial partner does not honor its contractual obligation to indemnify us for intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties or if any amounts received are not adequate to cover our liabilities or the costs associated with defense of such claims. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business.\nAs a publisher of original content and aggregator of third party content, we also face risks of periodic tort claims such as defamation or improper use of publicity rights, as well as infringement claims such as plagiarism. Whether or not they have merit, these claims may be time-consuming or costly to resolve.\nThe misappropriation, release, loss or misuse of AOL, consumer or other data could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations utilize significant amounts of data about our business, consumers, AOL subscribers and our advertising and publishing partners in order to deliver our content, products and services and our advertising solutions. Although we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into such data, the misappropriation, release, loss or misuse of this data, whether by accident, omission or as the result of criminal activity, sabotage or espionage, hacking, computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, equipment failure or other events, could lead to negative publicity, harm to our reputation, customer dissatisfaction, regulatory enforcement actions or individual or class-action lawsuits or significant expenditures to recover the data or protect data from similar releases in the future, and may otherwise adversely affect our business. With respect to our AOL subscribers, if we or other companies experience any unauthorized intrusion into subscribers\u2019 or customers\u2019 data, our subscribers may not be willing to provide the information necessary for them to continue their subscription, and our business could be adversely affected. Additionally, many of our subscribers pay by credit or debit card. Data breaches at other companies have resulted and could in the future result in card cancellations of some of our subscribers. To the extent we do not receive updated payment information for these subscribers, the rate of our subscriber base decline could increase. Furthermore, as not all of our systems are fully redundant, some data or systems might not be recoverable in a catastrophic event or other significant service disruption.\nNew or existing federal, state or international laws or regulations or industry self-regulatory principles applicable to our business or the lack of regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur business is subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations and industry self-regulatory principles, including those with respect to consumer privacy, advertising generally, consumer protection, content regulation, network neutrality, cyber security, data protection, intellectual property (including copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws), defamation, child protection, advertising to and collecting information from children, taxation, employment classification, billing, subpoena and warrant processes and others. These laws, regulations and principles and the interpretation or application of these laws, regulations and principles could change. In addition, new laws, regulations or principles affecting our business could be enacted. Furthermore, many laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies or have an unsettled application or scope with respect to the internet and related technologies and therefore their application on our business is often uncertain. Additionally, as our business evolves, we may be subject to new laws and the application of existing laws to us might change. These laws, regulations and principles are frequently costly to comply with and may divert a significant portion of management\u2019s attention. If we fail to comply with these applicable laws, regulations or principles, we could receive negative publicity and be subject to significant liabilities which could adversely affect our business.\nIn the United States, internet access services are generally classified as \u201cinformation services\u201d and, since open internet rules promulgated in 2010 have been struck down by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, are not subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d). The FCC has voted to reclassify internet access services as \"telecommunications services\" under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, which will subject internet service providers (\"ISPs\") to regulation that may restrict such providers from blocking or discriminating against content, but we do not know whether the rules implemented as a result of this vote will be adequate to prevent such conduct. Broadband providers have threatened litigation to challenge this action. In addition, Congress is considering legislation that would impose open internet protection, but it is unclear when Congress may take such action or whether that action will be successful. Currently the uncertainty of regulation or legislation preventing broadband ISPs from blocking or discriminating against our content could adversely affect our business.\nMany of our advertising partners are subject to industry specific laws and regulations or licensing requirements, including advertisers in the following industries: pharmaceuticals, online gaming, alcohol, adult content, tobacco, firearms, insurance, securities brokerage, real estate, sweepstakes, free trial offers, automatic renewal services and legal services. If any of our advertising partners fails to comply with any of these licensing requirements or other applicable laws or regulations, or if such laws and regulations or licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise expanded, we could receive negative publicity, incur significant penalties or our business could be otherwise adversely affected.\nFailure to comply with federal, state or international privacy laws or regulations, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new privacy laws or regulations, could adversely affect our business.\nA variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data. In addition to the potentially differing interpretations of existing law, the present landscape of public policy and privacy creates uncertainty for business planning. In such an uncertain environment, it is difficult to make informed long-term business planning decisions about data use, notice, storage, access, retention or choice. The existing privacy-related laws and regulations as well as industry self-regulatory principles are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. There is a possibility that these laws may be interpreted in a way that is inconsistent with our practices. In addition, various federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws regarding data protection and privacy matters. We have posted privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data on our websites. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any data-related consent\norders, Federal Trade Commission requirements or orders or other federal, state or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations or industry self-regulatory principles could result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities, or could result in us having to change our data collection practices, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, a failure or perceived failure to comply with industry standards or with our own privacy policies and procedures could result in a loss of consumers or advertisers and adversely affect our business.\nFederal, state and international governmental authorities continue to evaluate the privacy implications inherent in the use of cookies and a variety of other data correlation technologies for advertising and measurement. Our data management platform is designed to be a comprehensive suite of advertising technologies that will deploy tracking and data correlation technologies, the regulation of which could adversely affect our business.\nAny restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives that we undertake may not deliver the expected results and these actions may adversely affect our business operations.\nWe have undertaken and expect to continue to undertake various restructuring activities and cost reduction initiatives in an effort to better align our organizational structure and costs with our strategy. In connection with such activities, we may experience a disruption in our ability to perform functions important to our strategy. Such activities could result in significant disruptions to our operations, including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases, the successful implementation and completion of our strategic objectives and the results of our operations. If we do not fully realize or maintain the anticipated benefits of this or any restructuring plans and cost reduction initiatives, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility contain restrictive covenants which limit our business and financing activities.\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility include customary covenants which impose restrictions on our business and financing activities, subject to certain exceptions or the consent of our lenders including, among other things, limits on our ability to incur additional debt, create liens, enter into merger, acquisition and divestiture transactions, pay dividends and engage in transactions with affiliates. The credit facility contains certain customary affirmative covenants, including a requirement that we maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio, and customary events of default. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be adversely affected by events beyond our control, including economic, financial and industry conditions. A breach of any of the credit facility covenants, including a failure to maintain a required ratio or meet a required test, may result in an event of default. This may allow our lenders to terminate the commitments under the credit facility, declare all amounts outstanding under the credit facility (if any), together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable and exercise other rights and remedies. If this occurs, we may not be able to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, or otherwise repay the accelerated indebtedness.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes in cash, repay the Notes at maturity or repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change.\nHolders of our Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. Moreover, we will be required to repay the Notes in cash at their maturity, unless earlier converted or repurchased. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to Notes being converted or at their maturity.\nIn addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion or at maturity of the Notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the Indenture or to pay cash upon conversion or at maturity of the Notes as required by the Indenture would constitute a default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture for the Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under our credit facility or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Moreover, the occurrence of a fundamental change under the Indenture could constitute an event of default under any such agreements. If the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversion or at maturity of the Notes.\nThe conditional conversion feature of our outstanding Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of our Notes is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nOur outstanding Notes may be settled in cash, and the accounting method for such convertible debt securities could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn accordance with US GAAP accounting guidance for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion, we must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) in a manner that reflects our economic interest cost. The equity component of such instruments is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheets at the issuance date and the value of the equity component is treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we expect to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their face amount over the term of the Notes. We will report lower net income (or larger net losses) in our financial results because accounting guidance requires interest to include both the amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s non-convertible coupon interest rate, which could adversely affect our future financial results and the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that any shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected. In addition, our diluted earnings per share would also be adversely affected if the market price of our common stock increases such that the conversion rights of the Notes are triggered, or the market price of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants we issued in conjunction with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions and become \u201cin the money,\u201d then our diluted earnings per share would also be adversely affected.\nFuture sales of our common stock or other securities convertible into our common stock could lower the market price for our common stock.\nIn the future, we may issue or sell additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance in connection with our employee benefit plans, for purchase by employees under our employee stock purchase plan, upon conversion of our outstanding convertible notes and in relation to the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions we entered into in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nThe convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn August 2014, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain option counterparties. We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties pursuant to which we will sell warrants for the purchase of our common stock. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of our outstanding Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of any Notes. The warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the relevant warrants.\nThe option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of Notes or following any repurchase of notes by us in connection with any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.\nThe option counterparties for our convertible note hedge transactions are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that one or more of such option counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral. If any option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the convertible note hedge transaction. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our common stock market price and in volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by the option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of any option counterparty.\nThe terms of our outstanding Notes, Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and stockholder rights plan could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock.\nThe holders of our Notes have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes if a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date of the Notes. In addition, if a make-whole fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date of the Notes, we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. Furthermore, the indenture for the Notes prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions\nunless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Notes. These and other provisions in the indenture could discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law also may discourage, delay, or prevent a third party from acquiring us by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe prohibition of stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the board of directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that only stockholders holding not less than 40% of the voting power of our common stock may call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of the board of directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.\nWe also have a stockholder rights plan that could discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our board of directors. Our stockholder rights plan has been filed with and is publicly available at or from the SEC.\nThese provisions could also delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing or to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any of which could depress the market price of our common stock.\nWe may need to raise additional capital, and we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available.\nWe have funded our ongoing working capital, capital expenditure and financing requirements through cash flows from operations, asset dispositions, borrowings under the Credit Facility Agreement and proceeds from the issuance of the Notes; however, we may require additional financing in the future. Our ability to obtain future financing will depend on, among other things, our financial condition and results of operations as well as the condition of the capital markets or other credit markets at the time we seek financing. Our ability to fund our working capital, capital expenditure and financing requirements in the future may be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms. If we are unable to enter into the necessary financing arrangements or sufficient funds are not available on acceptable terms when required, we may not have sufficient liquidity and our business may be adversely affected.\nAcquisitions of other businesses could adversely affect our operations and result in unanticipated liabilities.\nSince January 1, 2014, we acquired companies such as Gravity, Convertro and Vidible and we may make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future. The completion of acquisitions and strategic investments as well as the integration of acquired companies or assets involve a substantial commitment of resources and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions and incur unanticipated liabilities that could harm our business. In addition, past or future transactions may be accompanied by a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe uncertainty of our returns on investment due to the new and developing industries in which some of the acquired companies operate;\n\u2022\nthe adverse effect of known potential liabilities or unknown liabilities, such as claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, associated with the companies acquired or in which we invest;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of integrating technology, administrative systems, personnel and operations of acquired companies into our services, systems and operations and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss or disengagement of key talent at acquired companies;\n\u2022\nthe potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management;\n\u2022\nadditional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquire or in which we invest and the failure of such businesses to perform as expected;\n\u2022\nthe failure to successfully further develop acquired technology, resulting in the impairment of amounts currently capitalized as intangible assets;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of reconciling potentially conflicting or overlapping contractual rights and duties; and\n\u2022\nthe potential impairment of relationships with consumers, partners and employees as a result of the combination of acquired operations and new management personnel.\nWe face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business.\nOur business operates and serves consumers globally. There are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022\neconomic volatility and global economic uncertainty;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nthe requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising;\n\u2022\nuncertain protection and enforcement of our investment or intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nimport or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in developing, staffing and simultaneously managing a large number of foreign operations as a result of distance as well as language and cultural differences;\n\u2022\nissues related to occupational safety and adherence to local labor laws and regulations;\n\u2022\npolitical or social unrest;\n\u2022\nrisks related to government regulation;\n\u2022\nthe existence in some countries of statutory stockholder minority rights and restrictions on foreign direct ownership;\n\u2022\nthe presence of corruption in certain countries; and\n\u2022\nhigher than anticipated costs of entry.\nOne or more of these factors could adversely affect our business.\nInternational expansion involves increased investment as well as risks associated with doing business abroad, as described above. In certain instances, we have expanded internationally through joint ventures, and our inability to control certain aspects of a joint venture partnership may impact the development and expansion of our offerings. Furthermore, investments in some regions can take a long period to generate an adequate return. In addition, as we expand into new international regions, we may have limited experience in operating and marketing our products and services in such regions and could be at a disadvantage compared to competitors with more experience.\nWe could be subject to additional tax liabilities which could adversely affect our business.\nInternational, federal, state and local tax laws and regulations affecting our business are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. These tax laws and regulations, or interpretations or application of these tax laws and regulations, could change; or new laws and regulations affecting our business could be enacted. Additionally, existing laws such as the Internet Tax Freedom Act (\u201cITFA\u201d), which exempts internet access from taxation by all but a few states and which has been extended until October 1, 2015, could expire, thereby imposing additional tax collection and remittance obligations that, in turn, may require significant resources to implement. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. Several taxing jurisdictions have sought to increase revenue by imposing new taxes on advertising generally, and internet advertising specifically, or by increasing general business taxes. Imposing new taxes on advertising or internet advertising would adversely affect us. Other states have sought to expand the definition of \u201cnexus\u201d for the purpose of taxing goods and services sold over the internet. If enacted, these new taxes would adversely affect our consumers and, as a result, could adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to utilize our tax attributes to offset future U.S. taxable income.\nWe believe that we have valuable tax attributes that are significant assets of the Company. Unless otherwise restricted, we can utilize these tax assets in certain circumstances to offset future U.S. taxable income, including in connection with capital gains that may be generated from a potential asset sale. Our ability to use the tax assets could be limited and the timing of the usage of the tax assets could be substantially delayed if we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. A company generally experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d for tax purposes if the percentage of stock owned by its 5% stockholders (as defined for tax purposes) increases by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. To help protect shareholder value and preserve our ability to use the tax assets, our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) adopted a Tax Asset Protection Plan (the \u201cTAPP\u201d) to act as a deterrent to any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of our outstanding common stock without the approval of the Board. Notwithstanding the adoption of the TAPP, we cannot eliminate the possibility that an \u201cownership change\u201d will occur. The amount by which our ownership may change in the future could, for example, be affected by purchases and sales of stock by stockholders and repurchases of stock by us, should we choose to do so. If the TAPP is not effective in preventing an ownership change our ability to use the tax assets to offset taxable income may be reduced or eliminated. Even if the TAPP is effective in preventing an ownership change, we will only be able to utilize these tax assets to the extent we generate taxable\nincome and the taxing authorities do not challenge the amount of our tax assets or otherwise make an adverse determination regarding our ability to use these assets, and therefore we are not able to guarantee that the tax assets will be valuable to us in the future.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nOur stock price has fluctuated significantly over the last two years and may fluctuate significantly in the future depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;\n\u2022\nsuccess or failure of our business strategy;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. When the market price of a company\u2019s stock fluctuates significantly, shareholders may institute securities class action litigation against that company. Any litigation against us could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert the time and attention of our management and other resources or otherwise harm our business.", "PERMNO": 93091, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "AOL"}
