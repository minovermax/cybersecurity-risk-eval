{"cik": "1319947", "company": "Designer Brands Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors when evaluating Designer Brands Inc. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business, operations, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease (\"COVID-19\") outbreak a pandemic. On March 18, 2020, to help control the spread of the virus and protect the health and safety of our customers, associates, and the communities we serve, we temporarily closed all of our stores in the U.S. and Canada. In addition, we took several actions in late March 2020 to reduce costs and operations to levels that were more commensurate with then-current sales, including furloughs and pay reductions. As this continues to be an unprecedented period of uncertainty, we have made and may continue to make adjustments to our operational plans, inventory controls, and liquidity management, as well as reductions to our expense and capital expenditure plans.\nDuring the second quarter and into the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we re-opened all of our stores, discontinued the furlough program, and restored pay for our associates that had taken pay reductions. Beginning in July 2020, we initiated an internal reorganization and reduction of our workforce with additional actions taken throughout fiscal 2020, resulting in the elimination of approximately 1,000 associate positions, including over 200 vacant positions that will not be filled.\nFollowing the re-opening of stores, we experienced and have continued to experience significantly reduced customer traffic and net sales, which included subsequent store closures and reduced hours in certain areas, primarily in Canada, where government-imposed restrictions were mandated. Our retail customers in the Brand Portfolio segment have had and are having similar experiences. Given the continuation of overall depressed consumer sentiment, customer behavior has been and may continue to be slow to return to pre-COVID-19 patterns and levels, if at all. We have continued to serve our customers through our e-commerce businesses during the period that our stores were closed and beyond, but store closures primarily during the first half of fiscal 2020 and continuing reduced customer traffic resulted in a sharp decline in our net sales and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic remains challenging and unpredictable. The ongoing and prolonged nature of the outbreak has continued to adversely impact our business and may lead to further adjustments to store operations, as well as continue to drive changes in customer behaviors and preferences, including reductions in consumer spending, which may necessitate further shifts in our business model. As such, the ultimate impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak to our businesses remain highly uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the widespread availability, use and effectiveness of vaccines, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. We may have additional write-downs or adjustments to inventories, receivables, long-lived assets, intangibles, goodwill, and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.\nLosses or disruptions associated with our distribution systems, including our distribution and fulfillment centers and our stores, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nFor our U.S. Retail segment operations, the majority of our inventory is shipped directly from suppliers to our distribution center in Columbus, Ohio and a West Coast facility operated by a third party, where the inventory is then processed, sorted and shipped to one of our pool locations located throughout the country and then on to the stores. Our inventory can also be shipped directly from our fulfillment center, also located in Columbus, Ohio, and supported by a third-party service provider, to our\ncustomers. For our Canada Retail segment, we engage a logistics service provider to receive purchases and distribute them to our stores. Through our ship-from-store capability, both in the U.S. and in Canada, inventory is shipped directly from our stores to customers. Through our drop ship program, inventory is shipped from the vendor's warehouse directly to the customer. For our Brand Portfolio segment, the majority of our inventory is shipped directly from factories in foreign countries to our distribution center in Westampton, New Jersey, where our wholesale inventory is then processed, sorted and provided to our customers' shipping carriers.\nOur operating results depend on the orderly operation of our receiving, distribution, and fulfillment processes, which in turn depends on vendors' adherence to shipping schedules and our effective management of our facilities. We may not anticipate all the changing demands that our operations will impose on our receiving, distribution, and fulfillment system, and events beyond our control, such as disruptions in operations due to public health threats, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, integration of new stores or customers, catastrophic events, labor disagreements, or shipping problems, any of which may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers. We rely on the flow of goods through ports worldwide on a consistent basis from factories and suppliers. Disruptions at ports could create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disruptions occur during peak importing times. For example, COVID-19 has resulted in delays at ports due to shipping backlog, availability of vessels, capacity constraints, and other disruptions. If we experience significant delays in receiving product, this could result in canceled orders by retailer customers, unanticipated inventory shortages or receipt of seasonal product after the peak selling season, and increased expense of air freight, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur distribution system is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties. Our third-party vendors may be the victim of cyber-related attacks that could lead to operational disruptions that could have an adverse effect on our ability to fulfill customer orders. The COVID-19 pandemic could also impact our ability to timely meet our customers\u2019 needs for fulfillment due to disruptions with third-party vendors, carriers, and other service providers, as well as increased freight and logistics costs. We are also subject to risk of damage or loss during delivery by our shipping vendors. If our merchandise is not delivered in a timely fashion or is damaged or lost during the delivery process, our customers could become dissatisfied and cease shopping on our sites, which would adversely affect our business and operating results. If we encounter problems with our ability to timely and satisfactorily fulfill customer orders, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies, we could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we maintain business interruption and property insurance, in the event any of our distribution and fulfillment centers shut down for any reason or if we were to incur higher costs and longer lead times in connection with a disruption at our distribution and fulfillment centers, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover the impact to the business.\nMeasures intended to prevent the spread of COVID-19 may negatively impact our operations.\nIn response to the COVID-19 outbreak and the government mandates implemented to control its spread, most of our corporate office associates are working remotely. If our associates are unable to work effectively as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, including because of illness, quarantines, office closures, ineffective remote work arrangements or technology failures or limitations, our operations would be adversely impacted. Further, remote work arrangements may increase the risk of cybersecurity incidents, data breaches or cyber-attacks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, due to, among other things, the loss of proprietary data, interruptions or delays in the operation of our business, damage to our reputation and any government-imposed penalty.\nCOVID-19 may negatively impact our international operations, including, but not limited to, our foreign sources of merchandise.\nWe have international operations in China, Canada, and Brazil, which may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, all of the products we manufacture in the Brand Portfolio segment come from third-party facilities outside of the U.S., with 73% sourced from China during fiscal 2020, whereas our U.S. Retail and Canada Retail merchandise is purchased from both domestic and foreign vendors. Many of our domestic vendors import a large portion of their merchandise from abroad, with the majority manufactured in China. The COVID-19 outbreak has led to work and travel restrictions within, to, and out of mainland China, which in turn may affect our manufacturers as well as our vendors\u2019 manufacturers. The COVID-19 outbreak also may make it difficult for our suppliers and our vendors\u2019 suppliers to source raw materials from, manufacture goods in, and export products from China and other countries. If the severity and reach of the COVID-19 outbreak continues or worsens, there may be significant and material disruptions to our supply chain and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe success of our Camuto Group business is dependent on the strength of our relationships with our retailer customers, and reductions in or loss of sales to such customers as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur major retailer customers have experienced and may continue to experience a significant downturn in their businesses as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and, in turn, these customers have and may continue to reduce their purchases from us, which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the Brand Portfolio segment.\nWe may be unable to anticipate and respond to fashion trends, consumer preferences and changing customer expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWith our customers staying home more as a result of COVID-19, we believe that there will continue to be a clear shift in consumer behavior and corresponding preferences to increased demand for athleisure and casual products and away from dress and seasonal categories. This requires us to anticipate and respond to numerous and fluctuating variables in fashion trends and other conditions in the markets in which our customers are situated. A variety of factors will affect our ability to maintain the proper mix of products, including: local economic conditions impacting customers' discretionary spending; unanticipated fashion trends; our ability to provide timely access to popular brands at attractive prices; our success in distributing merchandise to our stores and our wholesale retailer customers in an efficient manner; and changes in weather patterns, which, in turn, may affect consumer preferences. If we are unable to anticipate trends and fulfill the merchandise needs of our customers, we may experience decreases in our net sales and may be forced to increase markdowns in relation to slow-moving merchandise, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBeing an omni-channel retailer is a business necessity to meet customer experience expectations. In the event that our omni-channel strategy does not meet customer expectations or is not differentiated from our competitors, it may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on our strong relationships with vendors to purchase products. If these relationships were to be impaired, we may be unable to obtain a sufficient assortment of merchandise at attractive prices or respond promptly to changing fashion trends, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nOur success depends, to a significant extent, on the willingness and ability of our vendors to supply us with merchandise that meets our changing customer expectations, especially as we concentrate our receipts to fewer branded vendors. If we fail to maintain strong relationships with these vendors or if they fail to ensure the quality of merchandise they supply us, our ability to provide our customers with merchandise they want at favorable prices may be limited, which could have a negative impact on our business. Decisions by vendors not to sell to us or to limit the availability of their products to us could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, our inability to stock our sales channels with desired merchandise at attractive prices could result in lower net sales and decreased customer interest in our sales channels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, if our merchandise costs increase due to increases incurred by our vendors in raw materials, energy, labor, or duties and taxes on imports, or other reasons, our ability to respond or the effect of our response could adversely affect our net sales or gross profit. During fiscal 2020, three key third-party vendors together supplied approximately 22% of our retail merchandise. For fiscal 2021, we expect these and other high-volume vendors to become more concentrated for our total purchases. The loss of, or a reduction in, the amount and quality of merchandise supplied by any one of these vendors could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, any negative brand image, widespread product defects, or negative publicity related to these key vendors, or other vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and on our business.\nOur ABL Revolver and Term Loan have restrictions that could limit our ability to fund operations, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe ABL Revolver contains a minimum availability covenant where an event of default shall occur if availability is less than the greater of $30.0 million or 10.0% of the maximum credit amount. The Term Loan includes a springing covenant imposing a minimum earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") covenant, which arises when liquidity is less than $150.0 million. In addition, the ABL Revolver and the Term Loan each contain customary covenants restricting our activities, including limitations on the ability to sell assets, engage in acquisitions, enter into transactions involving related parties, incur additional debt, grant liens on assets, pay dividends or repurchase stock, and make certain other changes. There are specific exceptions to these covenants including, in some cases, upon satisfying specified payment conditions. We are restricted from paying dividends or repurchasing stock until the third quarter of fiscal 2021 at the earliest, after which certain limitations apply. Both the ABL Revolver and the Term Loan contain customary events of default with cross-default provisions. Upon an event of default that is not cured or waived within the cure periods, in addition to other remedies that may be available to the lenders, the obligations may be accelerated, outstanding letters of credit may be required to be cash collateralized and remedies may be exercised against the collateral.\nWe use the ABL Revolver for borrowings and to secure letters of credit, both of which reduce the amount of available credit. The actual amount that is available under the ABL Revolver fluctuates, due to factors including, but not limited to, eligible inventory and credit card receivables, reserve amounts, outstanding letters of credit, and outstanding borrowings. Consequently, it is possible that, should we need to access any additional funds from our ABL Revolver, it may not be available in full.\nOur international operations expose us to political, economic, operational, compliance and other risks.\nWe have international operations in various locations, including China, Canada, and Brazil. The success of our international operations may be adversely affected by political, economic and social conditions beyond our control, local laws and customs, and legal and regulatory constraints, including compliance with applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, labor and currency laws and regulations. Risks inherent in our existing and future operations also include, among others, public health threats, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, the costs and difficulties of managing operations outside of the U.S., possible adverse tax consequences from changes in tax laws or the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits, and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. For example, we rely on manufacturers that operate outside the U.S., including China, Vietnam, and Brazil, who may disclose our intellectual property or other proprietary information to competitors or third parties, which could result in the distribution and sale of counterfeit versions of our products. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may negatively impact our financial results. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe success of our Camuto Group business is dependent on our third-party manufacturers and other business partners.\nThe success of our Camuto Group business depends on our ability to obtain products from our third-party manufacturers on a timely basis, on acceptable terms and to our specifications. We do not exert direct control over the manufacturers' operations and cannot guarantee that any third-party manufacturer will have sufficient production capacity, meet our production deadlines or meet our product safety, social compliance, or quality standards. We typically do not have long-term supply contracts with our manufacturers, and the loss of any of our major manufacturers could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business. In addition, we cannot predict the impact of global events such as inclement weather, natural disasters, public health threats, or acts of terrorism. Our manufacturers operate outside the U.S. and are also subject to additional risks associated with international trade, as discussed in more detail in other risk factors herein. If these third-party manufacturers do not perform their obligations, cease working with us, fail to meet our product safety, social compliance or quality standards, or are unable to provide us with the materials and services we need at prices and terms that are acceptable to us, such disruptions may cause product delays and shortages, failure to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis, and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on our customer loyalty programs and marketing to drive traffic, sales and loyalty, and any decrease in membership or purchases from members could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCustomer traffic is influenced by our marketing and our loyalty programs. We rely on our loyalty programs to drive customer traffic, sales and purchase frequency. Loyalty members earn points toward discounts on future purchases through our VIP rewards programs in the U.S. and Canada. We employ a variety of marketing methods, including email, direct mail and social media, to communicate exclusive offers to our rewards members. As of January 30, 2021, we have approximately 30 million members enrolled in our loyalty programs who have made at least one purchase over the last two years. In fiscal 2020, shoppers in the loyalty programs generated approximately 84% of the combined U.S. Retail and Canada Retail segments' net sales. In the event that our rewards members do not continue to shop, we fail to add new members, the number of members decreases, or our marketing is not effective in driving customer traffic, such event could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to retain our existing senior management team and to continue to attract qualified new personnel could have a material adverse effect our business.\nOur business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization, which requires an experienced and talented management team. If we were to lose the benefit of the experience, efforts and abilities of any of our key executives and sourcing and buying personnel, our business could be adversely affected. We have entered into employment agreements with several key executives and also offer compensation packages designed to attract and retain talent. Furthermore, our ability to manage our business will require us to continue to train, motivate and develop our associates to maintain a high level of talent for future challenges and succession planning. Competition for these types of personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business.\nThe loss or disruption of information technology services could affect our ability to implement our strategies and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur information technology systems are an integral part of our strategies in efficiently operating our business, in managing operations and protecting against security risks related to our electronic processing and transmitting of confidential customer and associate data. The requirements to keep our information technology systems operating at peak performance may be higher than anticipated and could strain our capital resources, management of any system upgrades, implementation of new systems and the related change management processes required with new systems and our ability to prevent any future information security breaches. In addition, any significant disruption of our data center could have a material adverse effect on those operations dependent on those systems, specifically, our store and e-commerce operations, our distribution and fulfillment centers and our merchandising team. While we maintain business interruption and property insurance, in the event of a data center shutdown, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover the impact to the business.\nOur e-commerce operations are important to our business and are subject to various risks of operating online and mobile selling capabilities such as the failure of our information technology infrastructure, including any third-party hardware or software, resulting in downtime or other technical issues; reliance on third-party logistics providers to deliver our products to customers; inability to respond to technological changes; violations of state or federal laws; credit card fraud; or other information security breaches. Failure to mitigate these risks could reduce e-commerce sales, damage our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe face security risks related to our electronic processing of sensitive and confidential personal and business data. If we are unable to protect our data, a security breach could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGiven the nature of our business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential customer and associate data, in addition to proprietary business information. Some of our third-party service providers, such as identity verification and payment processing providers, also regularly have access to customer data. Additionally, we maintain other confidential, proprietary, or otherwise sensitive information relating to our business and from third parties. We may be vulnerable to a data compromise, computer viruses, physical and electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions, which may not be prevented by our efforts to secure our computer systems. Security measures in place include, but are not limited to, vulnerability scanning and patching, web-application firewalls, reverse-proxies, network firewalls, two-factor authentication, identity and access management, data encryption, point-to-point encryption and tokenization, intrusion detection and prevention devices, endpoint detection and response software, and data loss prevention software. Regular penetration tests of our networks are conducted by a third-party service provider and we leverage any findings to further enhance our security. We also employ secure file transfer options to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential information. Our critical data is replicated and backed up to a separate secured data center. However, our efforts may not be able to prevent rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks and a successful breach of our computer systems could result in misappropriation of personal, payment or sensitive business information. In addition, we rely on associates, contractors and other third parties who may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train associates, pay higher insurance premiums, and engage third-party specialists for additional services. An information security breach involving confidential and personal data could damage our reputation and our customers' willingness to purchase from us. In addition, we may incur material liabilities and remediation costs as a result of an information security breach, including potential liability for stolen customer or associate data, repairing system damage or providing credit monitoring or other benefits to customers or associates affected by the breach. In the event we experience an information security breach, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover the impact to the business. Although we have developed mitigating security controls to reduce our cyber risk and protect our data from loss or disclosure due to a security breach, including processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security.\nWe and our third-party service providers regularly experience cyberattacks aimed at disrupting services. If we or our third-party service providers experience security breaches that result in marketplace performance, availability problems, or the loss, corruption of, unauthorized access to, or disclosure of personal data or confidential information, people may become unwilling to provide us the information necessary to make purchases on our sites and our reputation and market position could be harmed. Existing customers may also decrease their purchases or close their accounts altogether. We could also face potential claims, investigations, regulatory proceedings, liability and litigation, and bear other substantial costs in connection with remediating and otherwise responding to any data security breach, all of which may not be adequately covered by insurance, and which may result in an increase in our costs for insurance or insurance not being available to us on economically feasible terms, or at all.\nInsurers may also deny us coverage as to any future claim. Any of these results could harm our growth prospects, financial condition, business and reputation.\nOur failure to comply with privacy laws and regulations, as well as other legal obligations, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nState, federal and foreign governments are increasingly enacting laws and regulations governing the collection, use, retention, sharing, transfer and security of personally identifiable information and data. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which took effect on January 1, 2020, imposes certain restrictions and disclosure obligations on businesses that collect personal information about California residents and provides for a private right of action, as well as penalties for noncompliance. We are subject to other consumer protection laws, including the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Additionally, the regulatory environment is increasingly demanding with frequent new and changing requirements concerning cybersecurity, information security and privacy, which may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Any failure by us or any of our business partners to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations may result in investigations or actions against us by governmental entities, private claims and litigation, fines, penalties or other liabilities. Such events may increase our expenses, expose us to liabilities and impair our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brands.\nThe value of our brands is largely dependent on the success of our merchandise assortment and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality customer experience. Any negative publicity about us or the significant brands we offer may reduce demand for our merchandise. Failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor, health and safety, accounting or environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions. In addition, negative claims or publicity, including social media, regarding celebrities we have license and endorsement arrangements with could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate. Consumer actions could include boycotts and negative publicity through social or digital media. Public perception about us or the products we carry, whether justified or not, could impair our reputation, involve us in litigation, damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe reputation and competitive position for our Camuto Group business are dependent on our ability to maintain the brands we license.\nIn partnership with Authentic Brands Group LLC, a global brand management and marketing company, we formed ABG-Camuto, a joint venture in which we have a 40% interest. This joint venture acquired several intellectual property rights, including Vince Camuto, Louise et Cie, and others, and focuses on licensing and developing new category extensions to support the global growth of these brands. ABG-Camuto has entered into a licensing agreement with us, which will earn royalties from the net sales of Camuto Group under the brands acquired. In addition, we own footwear, and in some cases handbag, licensing rights of Jessica Simpson, Lucky Brand, and, through a joint venture, Jennifer Lopez.\nWe rely on our ability to retain and maintain good relationships with the licensors and their ability to maintain strong, well-recognized brands and trademarks. The terms of our license agreements vary and are subject to renewal with various termination provisions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these licenses. Even our longer-term or renewable licenses are typically dependent upon our ability to market and sell the licensed products at specified levels, and the failure to meet such levels may result in the termination or non-renewal of such licenses. Furthermore, many of our license agreements require minimum royalty payments, and if we are unable to generate sufficient sales and profitability to cover these minimum royalty requirements, we may be required to make additional payments to the licensors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to the External Environment\nWe rely on consumer discretionary spending, which may be adversely affected by economic downturns and other macroeconomic conditions or trends and/or exacerbated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur business and operating results are subject to global economic conditions and their impact on consumer discretionary spending. Many factors that may negatively influence consumer spending are becoming increasingly present as a result of COVID-19 and political instability, including high levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth, declines in asset values and related market uncertainty, fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, general uncertainty regarding the overall future political and economic environment, and recent large-\nscale social unrest across much of the U.S. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our products, generally decline during periods of economic uncertainty, when disposable income is reduced or when there is a reduction in consumer confidence. Additionally, any of these adverse economic, political or social conditions may have the effect of directly or indirectly impacting our operating results in a negative manner. Moreover, we are unable to predict the severity of macroeconomic uncertainty, whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or the full impact such circumstances could have on our business.\nWe may be unable to compete in our highly competitive market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe footwear market is highly competitive with few barriers to entry. We compete against a diverse group of manufacturers and retailers, including department stores, mall-based shoe stores, national chains, independent shoe retailers, single-brand specialty retailers, online shoe retailers, brand-oriented discounters, multi-channel specialty retailers and brand suppliers. In addition, our wholesale retailer customers sell shoes purchased from competing footwear suppliers with owned and licensed brands that are well known. Our success depends on our ability to remain competitive with respect to assortment, quality, convenience and value. The performance of our competitors, as well as a change in their pricing policies as a result of the current economic environment, marketing activities and other business strategies, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nE-commerce networks have rapidly evolved while consumer receptiveness to shopping online has substantially increased. Competition from e-commerce players has significantly increased due to their ability to provide improved user experience, greater ease of buying goods, low or no shipping fees, faster shipping times and more favorable return policies. Businesses, including our suppliers, can easily launch online sites and mobile platforms at nominal costs by using commercially available software or partnering with any of a number of successful digital marketplace providers. Some of our suppliers use such platforms to compete with us by allowing consumers to purchase products directly through the supplier. Competitors with other revenue sources may also be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote more resources to websites, mobile platforms and applications and systems development.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we are unable to provide our customers cost-effective shopping platforms that are able to respond and adapt to rapid changes in technology.\nThe number of people who access the Internet through devices other than personal computers, including mobile phones, smartphones, handheld computers such as notebooks and tablets, video game consoles, and television set-top devices, has increased dramatically in the past few years. The smaller screen size, functionality, and memory associated with some alternative devices may make the use of our sites and purchasing our products more difficult. The versions of our sites developed for these devices may not be compelling to consumers. In addition, it is time consuming and costly to keep pace with rapidly changing and continuously evolving technology. We cannot be certain that our mobile applications or our mobile-optimized sites will be successful in the future.\nAs existing mobile devices and platforms evolve and new mobile devices and platforms are released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in adjusting and developing applications for changes and alternative devices and platforms, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support and maintenance of such applications. If we are unable to attract customers to our websites through these devices or are slow to develop versions of our websites that are more compatible with alternative devices or a mobile application, we may fail to capture a significant share of customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurther, we continually upgrade existing technologies and business applications, and we may be required to implement new technologies or business applications in the future. The implementation of upgrades and changes requires significant investments. Our results of operations may be affected by the timing, effectiveness and costs associated with the successful implementation of any upgrades or changes to our systems and infrastructure. In the event that it is more difficult for our customers to buy products from us on their mobile devices, or if our customers choose not to buy products from us on their mobile devices or to use mobile products that do not offer access to our websites, our customer growth could be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe rely on foreign sources for our merchandise, and our business is therefore subject to risks associated with international trade.\nWe face risks inherent in purchasing from foreign suppliers, such as: public health threats, including the COVID-19 outbreak; economic and political instability in countries where these suppliers are located; international hostilities or acts of war or terrorism affecting the U.S. or foreign countries from which our merchandise is sourced; increases in shipping costs; transportation delays and interruptions, including increased inspections of import shipments by domestic authorities; work stoppages; expropriation or nationalization; changes in foreign government administration and governmental policies; changes in import duties or quotas; compliance with trade and foreign tax laws; and local business practices, including compliance with foreign laws and with domestic and international labor standards. Such events may increase our costs and disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe require our business partners to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our internal requirements. However, we do not control such third parties or their labor and business practices. The violation of labor or other laws by one of our vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nLegislative or regulatory initiatives related to climate change could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGreenhouse gases may have an adverse effect on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Such events could have a negative effect on our business. Concern over climate change may result in new or additional legislative and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, which could result in future tax, transportation, and utility increases, which could have a material adverse effect our business. There is also increased focus, including by investors, customers, and other stakeholders, on these and other sustainability matters, including the use of plastic, energy, waste, and worker safety. Our reputation could be damaged if we do not, or are perceived to not, act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nUncertainty in future changes to legislation, regulatory reform or policies could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nTax laws, tariff, regulations, and policies in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic, political and other conditions. Such changes, including additional taxes and tariffs, may result in additional costs to our business and could require us to increase prices to our customers or, if unable to do so, result in a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nRisks Relating to our Common Shares\nOur amended articles of incorporation, amended and restated code of regulations and Ohio state law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Designer Brands Inc. This could adversely affect the value of our common shares.\nOur amended articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue up to 100,000,000 preferred shares and to determine the powers, preferences, privileges, rights, including voting rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions on those shares, without any further vote or action by the shareholders. The rights of the holders of our Class A common shares will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred shares that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred shares could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control and could adversely affect the voting power of our common shares.\nIn addition, provisions of our amended articles of incorporation, amended and restated code of regulations and Ohio law, together or separately, could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in control or limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common shares. Among other things, these provisions establish a staggered board, require a super-majority vote to remove directors, and establish certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders' meetings.\nWe do not expect a trading market for the Company's Class B common shares to develop and, therefore, any investment in the Class B common shares may be effectively illiquid, unless such shares are converted into the Company's Class A common shares.\nThere is currently no public market for the Company's Class B common shares. We do not intend to list the Class B common shares on any securities exchange or any automated quotation system. As a result, there can be no assurance that a secondary market will develop, and we do not expect any market makers to participate in a secondary market. Because the Class B common shares are not listed on a securities exchange or an automated quotation system, it may be difficult to obtain pricing information with respect to the shares. Accordingly, there may be a limited number of buyers if a holder decided to sell its Class B common shares. This may affect the price a holder would receive upon such sale. Alternatively, a holder of such shares could convert them into Class A common shares, on a share for share basis, prior to selling. However, such conversion could affect the timing of any such sale, which may in turn affect the price a holder may receive upon such sale.\nThe Schottenstein Affiliates, entities owned by or controlled by Jay L. Schottenstein, the Executive Chairman of the Designer Brands Inc. Board of Directors, and members of his family, directly control or substantially influence the outcome of matters submitted for Designer Brands Inc. shareholder votes, and their interests may differ from other shareholders.\nAs of January 30, 2021, the Schottenstein Affiliates have approximately 52% of the voting power of the Company's outstanding common shares. The Schottenstein Affiliates directly control or substantially influence the outcome of matters submitted to Designer Brands Inc.'s shareholders for approval, including the election of directors, approval of mergers or other business combinations, and acquisitions or dispositions of assets.

Opportunities may arise in the area of potential competitive business activities that may be attractive to the Schottenstein Affiliates and us.
