{"cik": "1138776", "company": "MEDGENICS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - Risk Factors.\nBusiness-Related Risks\nWe are a clinical stage medical technology company and have a history of significant and continued operating losses and a substantial accumulated earnings deficit and we may continue to incur significant losses.\nWe are a clinical stage medical technology company and since our inception have been focused on research and development and have not generated any substantial revenues. We have incurred net losses of approximately $18.43 million, $17.13 million and $15.07 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had stockholders\u2019 equity of approximately $29.66 million. We expect to incur additional operating losses, as well as negative cash flow from operations, for the foreseeable future, as we continue to expand our research and development and commence commercialization of our potential product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues from sales of our potential products will depend on:\n\u00b7 successful completion of necessary medical trials which have not advanced beyond Phase 1/2 stage;\n\u00b7 regulatory approval;\n\u00b7 commercialization (through partnership or licensing deals or through internal development) and market acceptance of new technologies and product candidates under development;\n\u00b7 medical community awareness; and\n\u00b7 changes in regulation or regulatory policy.\nWe believe that initial commercialization of any of our product candidates by us or any future strategic partners is not likely before 2018 and could easily take four years or more.\nWe will need substantial additional capital for the continued development of our product candidates and for our long-term operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $33.29 million. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements through the third quarter of 2016. However, changes in our business, whether or not initiated by us, may affect the rate at which we deplete our cash and cash equivalents. Our present and future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the level of patient recruitment in the human TARGTEPO trial in Israel and the United States using the second generation expression cassette of the HDAd viral vector, and the clinical result of the study\u2019s patients;\n\u00b7 the level of research and development investment required to develop our first orphan and rare disease product candidates, and to maintain and improve the TARGT platform;\n\u00b7 changes in product development plans needed to address any difficulties that may arise in manufacturing, preclinical activities, clinical studies or commercialization;\n\u00b7 our ability and willingness to enter into new agreements with strategic partners, and the terms of these agreements;\n\u00b7 our success rate in preclinical and clinical efforts;\n\u00b7 costs of recruiting and retaining qualified personnel;\n\u00b7 time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals; and\n\u00b7 costs of filing, prosecuting, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights.\nWe will require significant amounts of additional capital in the future, and such capital may not be available when we need it on terms that we find favorable, if at all. We may seek to raise these funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, credit facilities, or partnering or other corporate collaborations and licensing arrangements. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of opportunities, develop products and technologies, and otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly delayed or limited, and we may need to downsize or halt our operations.\nWe are still in the process of clinical trials and do not have a commercialized product and may never be able to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have completed a human clinical trial with respect to our TARGTEPO microorgans in pre-dialysis patients and are conducting a trial in dialysis patients in Israel with a second generation expression cassette of the HDAd viral vector. Only a small number of research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs and drug delivery systems. Potential products that appear to be promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons, including:\n\u00b7 failure to obtain approvals for clinical trials;\n\u00b7 lack of familiarity of health care providers and patients;\n\u00b7 low market acceptance as a result of lower demonstrated clinical safety or efficacy compared to other products or other potential disadvantages relative to alternative treatment methods;\n\u00b7 inability to obtain favorable coverage determinations from health plans and third-party payers;\n\u00b7 insufficient or unfavorable levels of reimbursement from government or third-party payers;\n\u00b7 infringement on proprietary rights of others for which we (or our licensees, if any) have not received licenses;\n\u00b7 incompatibility with other therapeutic products;\n\u00b7 potential advantages of alternative treatment methods;\n\u00b7 ineffective marketing and distribution support;\n\u00b7 lack of cost-effectiveness; or\n\u00b7 timing of market introduction of competitive products.\nIf any of these potential problems occurs, we may never successfully commercialize our TARGT platform. If we are unable to develop commercially viable products, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nOur TARGT platform technology is still being developed and has not been tested on a large patient population, and, therefore, we do not know all of the possible side effects and may not be able to commercialize our technology as planned.\nThe TARGT platform has not been tested on a large number of patients, and is still in an early stage of development. To date, although we have produced thousands of TARGT microorgans in the laboratory, we have administered TARGT microorgans to only a relatively small number of patients. We are in the early stages of developing the most efficient and effective methods to implant TARGT microorgans so as to attain sustained performance once in the patient and thereby produce the desired therapeutic effect for extended periods of time. While we have attained a number of positive results in our first clinical application, there is significant variability between patients. These and other aspects of the implementation and use of the TARGT platform are not yet fully developed or proven, and disappointing results and problems could delay or prevent their completion. Even if the TARGT platform works well in one indication, it could have disappointing results in others. If so, the development could be stalled or even blocked in one or more indications. Potential risks associated with the use of the TARGT platform are the development of an immune response to the vector or the encoded protein product, local inflammatory response to the implanted tissue or associated with the insertion of the TARGT microorgan in the surrounding tissue, autoimmunity to the endogenous protein product or potential overdose of protein due to difficulties in managing the continuous supply in the patient in accordance with patient need. Risk for immunogenic reaction to the vector is based on clinical studies using first general adenoviral vectors that contain a full complement of viral proteins. We currently use a gutless adenoviral vector in all our development activities and our current trial to reduce the risk of immune response of the TARGT microorgans prepared with viral vector particles. While these gutless adenoviral vectors do not include genes for viral proteins, the risk for somehow re-establishing expression of viral proteins cannot be entirely ruled out.\nThe basis for the risks described above is currently only theoretical since these effects have not been seen in the small number of patients that have received a TARGT microorgan in our TARGTEPO clinical trials or in preclinical safety studies performed in mice. However, the possible side effects and full efficacy and safety of the technology need to be tested in a substantial number of patients to verify this. Our previous safety tests may not be representative of either a larger multi-centric test or the commercial version of the technology in the general population. In addition, the full impact of the technology, and its many possible variations, on the body is, as yet, unknown. Although no side effects attributed to the TARGT platform were found to date in our TARGTEPO clinical trials, other than minor bruising at the implantation site, the possibility cannot be ruled out that serious side effects might be borne out by further trials, and if so, this could have serious implications on the viability of the technology and our business.\nAlthough the TARGT platform aims to minimize the residual number of viral vector particles and their proteins introduced into a body, there is a chance that the cumulative effect of TARGT reimplantation could result in an eventual buildup of viral proteins and an immunogenic reaction against the TARGT microorgans preventing further implantations, a scenario which could call the viability of the technology into question.\nSevere side effects or complications in trials, or post-approval, could also result in financial claims and losses against us, damage our reputation, and increase our expenses and reduce our assets. In addition, our product candidates may not gain commercial acceptance or ever be commercialized.\nWe are currently completely dependent upon the successful development of our TARGT platform. If we fail to successfully complete its development and commercialization or enter into licensing or partnership agreements, we will not generate operating revenues.\nAll of our efforts are currently focused on the development of our TARGT platform. There is no guarantee that we will succeed in developing products based on our TARGT platform. If we or any partner(s) or collaborator(s) that we may enter into a relationship with are unable to consummate the production of TARGT microorgans to provide the sustained protein or peptide therapy to treat various chronic diseases in a safe, stable, commercial end-product form, we will be unable to generate any revenues. There is no certainty as to our success, whether within a given time frame or at all. Any delays in our schedule for clinical trials, regulatory approvals or other stages in the development of our technology are likely to cause us additional expense, and may even prevent the successful finalization of any or all of our product candidates. Delays in the timing for development of our technology may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations due to the possible absence of financing sources for our operations during such additional periods of time. Although we may pursue other technologies (either developed in-house or acquired), there is no assurance that any other technology will be successfully identified or exploited.\nClinical trials involve lengthy and expensive processes with uncertain outcomes, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nWe cannot predict whether we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials, which would cause us or regulatory authorities to delay or suspend clinical trials, or delay the analysis of data from completed or ongoing clinical trials. We estimate that clinical trials involving various applications of our TARGT platform will continue for several years; however, such trials may also take significantly longer to complete and may cost more money than we expect. Failure can occur at any stage of testing, and we may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent commercialization of the current, or a future, more advanced, version of our TARGT platform, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7 delays in obtaining regulatory approvals to commence a clinical trial;\n\u00b7 failure or inability to recruit qualified investigators;\n\u00b7 slower than anticipated patient recruitment and enrollment;\n\u00b7 negative or inconclusive results from clinical trials;\n\u00b7 unforeseen safety issues;\n\u00b7 an inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment; and\n\u00b7 problems with investigator or patient compliance with the trial protocols.\nA number of companies in the medical device, biotechnology, and biopharmaceutical industries including those with greater resources and experience than us have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials. Despite the successful results reported in early clinical trials regarding our TARGTEPO microorgans, we do not know whether any clinical trials we or any future clinical partners may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market TARGTEPO microorgans or any other product based on our TARGT platform. If later-stage clinical trials involving our TARGT platform do not produce favorable results, our ability to obtain regulatory approval may be adversely impacted, which will have an adverse material effect on our business, financial condition and the results of our operations.\nPotential difficulty with, and delays in, recruiting additional patients for human clinical trials may adversely affect the timing of our clinical trials and our working capital requirements.\nOur research and development is highly dependent on timely recruitment of the requisite number and type of patients for our clinical trials. We have previously found it very difficult to recruit such patients and the increased volume and ethnic backgrounds required for future testing may render such testing even more difficult. Such larger studies will likely be based on the use of multicenter, multinational design, which can prove difficult to manage and could result in delays in patient recruitment. In addition, as we pursue development of the TARGT technology in orphan and rare disease applications, we may find it difficult to find sufficient treatment-na\u00efve patients needed for initial trials, especially within commercially-reasonable geographical regions. Delays in the recruitment of such patients could delay our trials and negatively impact our working capital requirements.\nPotential difficulty with, and delays in, obtaining vectors necessary for conducting human clinical trials and additional research and development of the TARGT platform may adversely affect the timing of our clinical trials, the further development of our technology and our working capital requirements.\nWe need specific vectors in order to conduct our research and development of our TARGT platform and to create TARGT microorgans to conduct our clinical trials. We currently use only one outside source for the production and delivery of research grade versions of new vectors for developing new products and have begun to develop the production of the necessary vectors internally. Such outside source is highly dependent on the work of a particular individual. Although we have a contract with such source, there is a possibility that the source could discontinue its business or the contract could be terminated, that the particular individual could become unable to work on the production of vectors or that other problems could occur with the timely production and delivery of vectors. We will continue our internal program to make viral vectors as a hedge against a loss of our current source. If we are unable to obtain or produce internally the necessary vectors, our research and development of rare and orphan disease targets will be severely delayed. Vectors intended for use in clinical trials must be produced by other vector suppliers who manufacture according to strict requirements of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). We have worked with one such GMP vector manufacturer who has supplied the GMP vectors used in our TARGTEPO human clinical studies and we intend to continue to order new GMP vectors when needed from such supplier as well as new supplier as appropriate. There is a possibility that the existing supplier would discontinue its business or that other problems could occur with the timely production and delivery of GMP vectors. If this were to occur, we would need to establish GMP vector production at one or more alternative GMP vector manufacturers. Delays in obtaining the vectors could delay any new trials. Without the necessary vectors, we would be unable to continue the research and development of our technology, which would negatively impact our working capital requirements.\nWe may not successfully establish and maintain relationships with third-party service providers and collaborators, which could adversely affect our ability to develop our TARGTEPO product candidate.\nOur ability to commercialize our TARGTEPO technology is dependent on our ability to reach strategic licensing and other development agreements with appropriate partners, including pharmaceutical companies and biotech firms. If we are unable to successfully negotiate such agreements, we may not be able to continue to develop the TARGTEPO product without raising significant additional capital for commercialization.\nThe successful adoption of TARGT platform also relies on our ability to bring about practical, reliable and cost-effective production of TARGT microorgans on a commercial scale and its use in patients in widespread locations. This requires the design, development and commercial scale-up of TARGT manufacturing capability, intended for implementation in regional TARGT processing centers, together with appropriate logistical capabilities to enable local treatment of patients in their communities, in a cost effective and reliable manner. TARGT microorgan processing is intended to be effected using semi-automated processing stations employing sealed cassettes and other single use items for each patient. Although we have experienced initial positive results in processing MOs in individual closed processing chambers that were shipped from Israel at our contract manufacturing organization (CMO) in a GMP-certified facility in California, we or our CMO may not necessarily be able to replicate those results or be able to accommodate greater amounts. Treatment of patients in various locations is dependent upon reliable acquisition of MOs and implantation or ablation of TARGT microorgans by trained local physicians, using appropriate proprietary and nonproprietary devices and products, and upon the transport of microorgans and TARGT microorgans between the TARGT processing centers and local treatment clinics via reliable and cost effective logistical arrangements. It may also be important that the processing center not require highly skilled operators, specialist laboratories or clean rooms. The inability to adequately scale and rollout such technology could damage the cost-effectiveness and therefore one of the anticipated competitive advantages of the TARGT platform.\nOur core business strategy is to develop the TARGT microorgan for use in rare and orphan disease markets that our company would internally develop and launch. However, we do plan to explore collaborative relationships or strategic partnerships and/or license the TARGTEPO program after receipt of POC results utilizing the second generation expression cassette of the HDAd viral vector. We may not be able to identify such collaborators and partners on a timely basis and we may not be able to enter into relationships with any future collaborator(s) or partner(s) on terms that are commercially beneficial to us or at all. In addition, such relationships and partnerships may not come to fruition or may not be successful. Our agreements with these third parties may also contain provisions that restrict our ability to develop and test our product candidates or that give third parties rights to control aspects of our product development and clinical programs.\nThe third-party contractors may not assign as great of a priority to our clinical development programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking such programs directly and, accordingly, may not complete activities on schedule, or may not conduct the studies or our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or with our trial design. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, or if their performance is substandard, we may be required to replace them.\nIn addition, conflicts may arise with our collaborators, e.g. those concerning the interpretation of clinical data, the achievement of milestones, the interpretation of financial provisions or the ownership of intellectual property developed during the collaboration. If any conflicts arise with our existing or future collaborators, they may act in their self-interest, which may be adverse to our best interests. The third-party contractors may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of whom may compete with us. If the third-party contractors work with our competitors, our competitive position may be harmed.\nIn addition, although we attempt to audit and control the quality of third-party data, we cannot guarantee the authenticity or accuracy of such data, nor can we be certain that such data has not been fraudulently generated. The failure of third parties to carry out their obligations towards us would materially adversely affect our ability to develop and market our TARGT platform. To date, we have only entered into one collaboration agreement which addressed the feasibility and laboratory development of HEMODURE. That agreement expired in September 2011, and we have since terminated the HEMODURE program.\nWhile our new strategic focus is on rare and orphan diseases, therapeutic proteins and peptides for these diseases have never been produced by the TARGT, and we may not be successful in creating a TARGT microorgan that produces proteins and peptides for the treatment of rare and orphan diseases.\nWhile the TARGT microorgan\u2019s attributes of producing low levels of autologous proteins for an extended period of time would appear to be highly amenable to treating rare and orphan diseases, we have not yet created a TARGT microorgan that addresses a rare or orphan disease and may never overcome the technical hurdles. In addition, we may target rare and orphan diseases that require peptides or proteins with post-translational modifications for efficacy, and we have not yet produced peptides or proteins with post-translational modifications in the TARGT. The production of peptides and/or proteins with post-translational modifications could require us to develop new techniques of protein production from the TARGT microorgan which may delay research and development timelines or may be simply too great to overcome.\nWe have no marketing experience, sales force or distribution capabilities. If our product candidates are approved, and we are unable to recruit key personnel to perform these functions, we may not be able to successfully commercialize the products.\nAlthough we do not currently have any marketable products, our ability to produce revenues ultimately depends on our ability to sell our product candidates if and when they are approved by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. We currently do not have a marketing and sales staff or distribution capabilities. Developing a marketing and sales force is also time-consuming and could delay the launch of new products or expansion of existing product sales. In addition, we will compete with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. If we fail to establish successful marketing and sales capabilities or fail to enter into successful marketing arrangements with third parties, our ability to generate revenues will suffer.\nFurthermore, even if we enter into marketing and distributing arrangements with third parties, these third parties may not be successful or effective in selling and marketing our TARGT platform. If we fail to create successful and effective marketing and distribution channels, our ability to generate revenue and achieve our anticipated growth could be adversely affected. If these distributors experience financial or other difficulties, sales of our products could be reduced, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe are subject to intense government regulation and we may not be able to successfully complete the necessary clinical trials.\nApproval for clinical trials depends, among other things, on data obtained from our pre-clinical and clinical activities, including completion of pre-clinical animal and in vitro studies in a timely manner. These pre-clinical and clinical activities must meet stringent quality assurance and compliance requirements. Data obtained from such activities are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Approval also depends on our obtaining certain key materials such as the GMP produced gutless adenoviral vector, which is prepared through a contract with a GMP vector manufacturer. Being a new version of an adenoviral vector, production of gutless adenoviral vector involves the use of certain special techniques for its preparation, which are somewhat different from those normally used by GMP vector manufacturers of first generation adenoviral vectors and such manufacturer may not be able to meet our requirements on a timely basis, or at all. Delays in obtaining a GMP vector needed for a specific clinical trial could delay the start of the trial. In addition, we cannot guarantee approval of our clinical trial protocols under the human subject protection laws and regulations of the countries where such trials are planned.\nWe currently have limited experience in and resources for conducting the large-scale clinical trials which may hamper our ability to obtain or comply with regulatory approval. The failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in criminal prosecution, civil penalties, product recalls, withdrawal of product approval, mandatory restrictions and other actions, which could impair our ability to conduct business.\nThe FDA and other health authorities will regulate our product candidates and we may never receive regulatory approval to market and sell our product candidates.\nOur product candidates will require regulatory approvals prior to sale. In particular, our product candidates are subject to stringent approval processes, prior to commercial marketing, by the FDA and by comparable agencies in all countries where we operate and desire to introduce our product candidates, whether sold via a strategic partner or directly by us. These requirements range from vector and TARGT efficacy and safety assessment in Phase 3 clinical trials to long-term follow-up assessments on treated patients in clinical trials for product approval for sale. The process of obtaining FDA and corresponding foreign approvals is costly and time-consuming, and we cannot assure that such approvals will be granted. Also, the regulations we are subject to change frequently and such changes could cause delays in the development of our product candidates.\nIt typically takes a company several years or longer to satisfy the substantial requirements imposed by the FDA and comparable agencies in other countries for the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical and biological products. Pharmaceutical or biological products must be registered in accordance with applicable law before they can be manufactured, marketed and distributed. This registration must include medical data proving the product\u2019s safety, efficacy and clinical testing. Also included in product registration should be references to medical publications and information about the production methods and quality control.\nTo obtain regulatory approvals in the United States, we or a collaborator must ultimately demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that our product candidates are sufficiently safe and effective for their proposed administration to humans. Many factors, both known and unknown, can adversely impact clinical trials and the ability to evaluate a product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy, including:\n\u00b7 FDA or other health regulatory authorities or instructional review boards (e.g., IRB) decision(s) not to approve a clinical trial protocol or place a clinical trial on hold;\n\u00b7 suitable patients not enrolling in a clinical trial in sufficient numbers or at the expected rate, for reasons such as the size of the prospective patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the perceptions of investigators and patients regarding safety, and the availability of other treatment options;\n\u00b7 clinical trial data being adversely affected by trial conduct or patient withdrawal prior to completion of the trial;\n\u00b7 competition with ongoing clinical trials and scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians;\n\u00b7 patients experience serious adverse events, including adverse side effects of our drug candidates, for a variety of reasons that may or may not be related to our product candidates, including the advanced stage of their disease and other medical problems;\n\u00b7 patients in the placebo or untreated control group exhibiting greater than expected improvements or fewer than expected adverse events;\n\u00b7 third-party clinical investigators not performing the clinical trials on the anticipated schedule or consistently with the clinical trial protocol and good clinical practices, or other third-party organizations not performing data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u00b7 service providers, collaborators or co-sponsors not adequately performing their obligations in relation to the clinical trial or cause the trial to be delayed or terminated;\n\u00b7 being unable to obtain a sufficient supply of manufactured clinical trial materials;\n\u00b7 regulatory inspections of manufacturing facilities requiring us or a co-sponsor to undertake corrective action or suspend the clinical trials;\n\u00b7 interim results of the clinical trial being inconclusive or negative;\n\u00b7 clinical trial, although approved and completed, generating data that are not considered by the FDA or others to be sufficient to demonstrate safety and efficacy; and\n\u00b7 changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions affecting the conduct of the clinical trial or the interpretation of its results.\nThere can be no assurance that our clinical trials will in fact demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the FDA and others, that our product candidates are sufficiently safe or effective. The FDA or we may also restrict or suspend our clinical trials at any time if either believes that we are exposing the subjects participating in the trials to unacceptable health risks.\nDelays in obtaining such clearances and/or changes in existing requirements could have a material adverse effect on our company by making it difficult to advance product candidates or by reducing or eliminating their potential or perceived value and, therefore, our ability to conduct our business as currently planned could materially suffer. Failure to obtain required regulatory approvals could require us to delay, curtail or cease our operations. Even if we invest the necessary time, money and resources required to advance through the FDA approval process, there is no guarantee that we will receive FDA approval of our product candidates.\nOur failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA or state agencies, which may include any of the following sanctions:\n\u00b7 warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u00b7 repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls, or seizures of our products;\n\u00b7 operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production;\n\u00b7 refusing our requests for regulatory clearance or premarket approval of new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products;\n\u00b7 withdrawing regulatory clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted; and\n\u00b7 criminal prosecution.\nIf any of these events were to occur, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approvals, our products will be subject to ongoing regulatory review and if we fail to comply with continuing regulations, we could lose those approvals and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be seriously harmed.\nEven if our TARGT platform receives initial regulatory approval or clearance for specific therapeutic applications, we will still be subject to ongoing reporting obligations, and such product and the related manufacturing operations will be subject to continuing regulatory review, including FDA inspections. This ongoing review may result in the withdrawal of our product from the market, the interruption of manufacturing operations and/or the imposition of labeling and/or marketing limitations related to specific applications of our product. Since many more patients will be exposed to our TARGT platform following its marketing approval, serious but infrequent adverse reactions that were not observed in clinical trials may be observed during the commercial marketing of such product. In addition, the manufacturer(s) and the manufacturing facilities that we will use to produce our TARGT microorgans will be subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA and other similar foreign regulators. Late discovery of previously unknown problems with any product, manufacturer or manufacturing process, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in actions, such as:\n\u00b7 restrictions on such product, manufacturer or manufacturing process;\n\u00b7 warning letters from the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of the product from the market;\n\u00b7 suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 refusal by such regulator to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we or our licensees (if any) submit;\n\u00b7 voluntary or mandatory recall;\n\u00b7 fines;\n\u00b7 refusal to permit the import or export of our product;\n\u00b7 product seizures or detentions;\n\u00b7 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and\n\u00b7 adverse publicity.\nIn addition, from time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in the United States that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing any regulatory clearance or approval that we receive from the U.S. regulatory authorities. FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product. We cannot predict what these changes will be, how or when they will occur or what effect they will have on the regulation of our product. If we, or our licensees, suppliers, collaborative research partners or clinical investigators are slow to adapt, or are unable to adapt, to changes in existing regulatory requirements or the adoption of new regulatory requirements or policies, we may lose marketing approval for any of the therapeutic applications of our product (to the extent that such applications are initially approved), resulting in decreased or lost revenue from milestones, product rental or usage fees, or royalties.\nEven if approved by the necessary regulatory authorities, our product candidates may not gain market acceptance.\nThe development of a market for new technology is affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance the TARGT platform will gain acceptance within the markets at which it is targeted. Further, the internal structure for medical service provision varies considerably from territory to territory throughout the world and may be, in some cases, subject to public sector procurement processes, which could delay penetration of this market by our product candidates. If the market does not accept our product candidates, when and if we are able to commercialize them, then we may never become profitable. Factors that could delay, inhibit or prevent market acceptance of our product candidates may include:\n\u00b7 timing and receipt of marketing approvals;\n\u00b7 safety and efficacy of the products;\n\u00b7 patient reluctance to undergo the harvest and TARGT implantation procedure physician reluctance or inability to perform the harvest and TARGT implantation procedure\n\u00b7 emergence of equivalent or superior products;\n\u00b7 cost-effectiveness of products;\n\u00b7 findings by health plans or third-party payers that the product candidates are not reasonable and necessary, or are subject to additional prerequisites for coverage;\n\u00b7 decisions by health plans not to cover the TARGT platform if they conclude that it is experimental or investigational; and\n\u00b7 ineffective marketing.\nOur success is first and foremost reliant upon there being a demand for our technology by patients, payers, and in the case of TARGTEPO, potential strategic partners. We and potential partners will need to establish and manage reliable and cost effective TARGT production capabilities on a large scale. There is risk that such facilities may not be successfully established, may not meet their performance requirements or cost targets, or in other ways fail to deliver the requisite level of reliable and cost-effective TARGT microorgans for clinical use. In addition, sales will rely upon demand for TARGT products, which in turn is dependent upon patient and doctor and other medical practitioner perceptions as to safety, reliability and efficacy of our product candidates. Although our product candidates will be subject to extensive testing, there can be no assurance that consumers will ultimately accept them relating to safety.\nOur efforts to comply with federal and state fraud and abuse laws could be costly, and, if we are unable to fully comply with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u00b7 federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u00b7 federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which creates federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and which also imposes certain obligations on entities with respect to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7 federal False Statements Statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u00b7 federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits, among other things, making payments to foreign officials of any country outside of the United States for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business; and\n\u00b7 state laws analogous to each of the above federal laws, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws (some of which may apply to healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers), as well as certain state laws that require pharmaceutical and medical device companies to comply with industry voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government.\nIf our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from third-party payer programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we may do business are found to be non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions including exclusions from government-funded health care programs, which could also negatively impact our operations. Our ongoing efforts to comply with these laws may be costly, and our failure to comply with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of subjective interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management's attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation.\nIf any of our key employees discontinue his or her services with us, our efforts to develop our business may be delayed.\nOur success will depend on the retention of our directors and other current and future members of our management and technical team, including Michael F. Cola, our President and Chief Executive Officer, John H. Leaman, our Chief Financial Officer, and Garry A. Neil, our Chief Scientific Officer, and on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that we will retain the services of any of our directors, officers or employees, or attract or retain additional senior managers or skilled employees. Furthermore, we do not carry key man insurance with respect to any of such individuals.\nThe TARGT platform is still in development and is dependent on further development and testing to reach commercial production. We currently employ a small number of key personnel including top managers, scientists, engineers and clinical experts who are important to developing the TARGT platform and have a high level of accumulated knowledge which would be lost if they left our company. If these employees leave our company or otherwise are unable to provide services, there could be significant implications on the timing and cost of future development of the technology. Because competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, we may be unable to timely find suitable replacements with the necessary scientific expertise. We cannot assure you that our efforts to attract or retain such personnel will be successful.\nIf we are not able to obtain and maintain adequate patent protection for our product candidates, we may be unable to prevent our competitors from using our technology.\nOur ability to commercialize the TARGT platform, or our product candidates, will depend, in part, on our ability, both in the United States and in other countries, to obtain patents, enforce those patents, preserve trade secrets and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Our existing owned patent and patent application portfolio directed to TARGT platform, including TARGTEPO, currently contains 55 issued patents, and 43 pending and allowed patent applications. Applications for patents and other intellectual property rights capable of being registered have been, and will be, filed in certain key jurisdictions. We may not successfully obtain patents in the countries in which patent applications have been or will be filed, and we may not develop other patentable products or processes. In addition, any future patents may not prevent other persons or companies from developing similar or medically equivalent products and other persons or companies may be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our products or that will require us to license or pay significant fees or royalties. Furthermore, issued patents may not be valid or enforceable, or be able to provide our company with meaningful protection. Patent litigation is costly and time-consuming and there can be no assurance that we will have, or will be able to devote, sufficient resources to pursue such litigation. In addition, potentially unfavorable outcomes in such proceedings could limit our intellectual property rights and activities.\nWe cannot be certain that any of our patent applications, or those of our licensors, will result in issued patents. In addition, because the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions, the patents we own and license, or any further patents we may own or license, may not prevent other companies from developing similar or therapeutically equivalent products. Patents also will not protect our product candidates if competitors devise ways of making or using these product candidates without legally infringing our patents. In recent years, several companies have been extremely aggressive in challenging patents covering pharmaceutical products, and the challenges have often been successful. We cannot be assured that our patents will not be challenged by third parties or that we will be successful in any defense we undertake. Failure to successfully defend a patent challenge could materially and adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent defense and enforcement.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements and our employees to execute assignment of invention agreements to us on commencement of their employment. Agreements with our employees aim to prevent employees from bringing any proprietary rights of third parties to us. We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials. However, if our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators or other advisors breach their confidentiality or other obligations to us, we may not be able to successfully or effectively prevent such breach and we could be adversely impacted if the protection of our trade secrets or other intellectual property is compromised.\nEven if our product candidates and the methods for treating patients for prescribed indications using these product candidates are covered by valid and enforceable patents and have claims with sufficient scope, disclosure and support in the specification, the patents will provide protection only for a limited amount of time. Our and our licensors\u2019 ability to obtain patents can be highly uncertain and involve complex and in some cases unsettled legal issues and factual questions.\nFurthermore, different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents, and patents issued in different countries provide different degrees of protection against the use of a patented invention by others. Therefore, if the issuance to us or our licensors, in a given country, of a patent covering an invention is not followed by the issuance, in other countries, of patents covering the same invention, or if any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability, or scope of the claims in, or the written description or enablement in, a patent issued in one country is not similar to the interpretation given to the corresponding patent issued in another country, our ability to protect our intellectual property in those countries may be limited.\nUnauthorized parties may try to copy aspects of our product candidates and technologies or obtain and use information we consider proprietary. Policing the unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult. We cannot guarantee that no harm or threat will be made to our or our collaborators\u2019 intellectual property. In addition, changes in, or different interpretations of, patent laws in the United States and other countries may also adversely affect the scope of our patent protection and our competitive situation.\nThere is certain subject matter that is patent eligible in the United States but not generally patent eligible outside of the United States and vice versa. Differences in what constitutes patent eligible subject matter in various countries may limit the protection we can obtain in the United States and outside of the United States.\nAs we develop the TARGT platform, we may need to obtain licenses to protect our rights to make and use our technology. There is no assurance that we will obtain licenses for such technology or would be able to obtain licenses to any third party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms.\nAdditionally, there can be no assurance that we can successfully develop non-infringing alternatives on a timely basis, or license non-infringing alternatives, if any exist, on commercially reasonable terms. A significant intellectual property impediment to our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates could adversely affect our business prospects.\nEven if patents are issued to us or our licensors covering embodiments of our product candidates, devices, or methods of using them, those patents can be challenged by our competitors who can argue such patents are invalid or unenforceable, or that the claims of the issued patents should be limited or narrowly construed. Patents also will not protect our product candidates if competitors devise ways of making or using these product candidates without legally infringing our patent claims.\nWe cannot assure you that third parties cannot and will not design around our patents and develop similar products or that we will be successful in enforcing our patents on such design around products. The biosimilars pathway created under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) may allow for another manufacturer to develop a non-patent infringing product using data from our own clinical trials. Prior to the enactment of BPCIA, information in approved Biologic License Applications (BLAs) could not be relied upon by other manufacturers to establish the safety and efficacy of their products for which they were seeking FDA approval. Accordingly, if the TARGT platform were approved under a BLA, other manufacturers potentially could develop and seek FDA approval of \u201cbiosimilar\u201d products at some point in the future.\nThe sale of any product may be reliant on licenses from third parties, and any loss of these rights would adversely affect our business.\nAs indicated above, we currently have licenses to certain third party intellectual property, and therefore we do not own all of the intellectual property upon which a TARGT-based product may be made, used, or sold.\nOur business is dependent on proprietary rights that may be difficult to protect and such dependence could affect our ability to effectively compete.\nIn addition to our patents, we also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position especially where we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, others, including our competitors, may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. We take precautionary measures to protect our proprietary rights and information, including the use of confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants, and those with whom we have academic and commercial relationships. However, we may not have such agreements in place with all such parties and, in spite of the measures, there can still be no guarantee that agreements will not be violated or that there will be an adequate remedy available for a violation of an agreement. Any of these events could prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates. Trade secrets are by nature difficult to protect. Our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors, and confidentiality agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and/or know-how. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nIn addition, third parties may have trademarks or pending applications on our contemplated marks, similar marks, or in confusingly similar fields of use (or may be using our contemplated marks or similar marks). We may have to change our use of certain marks which could have an adverse impact on our business and may require us to spend additional funds to develop new marks. We anticipate that we will spend both time and management resources to develop and file trademark applications in the future.\nWe are subject to intense competition in the therapeutic protein market from companies with greater resources and more mature products, which may result in our competitors developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than us.\nWhile we believe our TARGT platform has significant advantages, there are a number of well-established and substantial companies engaged in the development, production, marketing, sale and distribution of products that are potentially competitive with our product candidates or the TARGT platform in general. Many of these companies are more experienced than our company is and represent significant competition. It is also possible that other parties have in development products substantially similar to or with properties that are more efficacious, less invasive and more cost effectively delivered than our product candidates or the TARGT platform in general. The success of our competitors in developing, bringing to market, distributing and selling their products could negatively affect our result of operations and/or general acceptance of our product candidates.\nWe face risks related to the general economic conditions that may adversely affect our business.\nIn general, our operating results can be significantly and adversely affected by negative economic conditions, high labor, material and commodity costs, and unforeseen changes in demand for our potential products. These conditions have resulted and could continue to result in slower adoption of new technologies and cost containment efforts by governments and other payers for healthcare research and development, products and services.\nThe grants we received from the Israeli Office of the Chief Scientist place certain restrictions on us.\nThrough our wholly-owned Israeli subsidiary, we have received an aggregate of $10.76 million in grants from the Israeli Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS). The grant agreements require repayment of the grants provided to us through the payment of royalties out of income received from commercializing the developed technology. Pursuant to the Israeli Encouragement of Industrial Research and Development Law, certain limitations will apply to the change of control of the grant recipient and the financing, mortgaging, production, exportation, licensing and transfer or sale of its technology and intellectual property to third parties, which will require the OCS\u2019s prior consent and, in case such a third party is outside of Israel, extended royalties and/or other fees. This could have a material adverse effect on and significant cash flow consequences to our company if, and when, any technologies, intellectual property or manufacturing rights are exported, transferred or licensed to third parties outside Israel. If the OCS does not wish to give its consent in any required situation or transaction, we would need to negotiate a resolution with the OCS. In any event, such a transaction, assuming the OCS approved it, would involve monetary payments, such as royalties or fees, of not less than the applicable funding received from the OCS plus interest and, in aggregate, not to exceed six times the applicable funding received from the OCS.\nHealth care policy changes, including U.S. health care reform legislation signed in 2010, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nHealth care reform is often a subject of attention in governments that are trying to control health care expenditures. Health care reform proposals have been the subject of much debate in the U.S. Congress and some state legislatures, as well as in other countries. There is no assurance that legislation or underlying rules and guidelines resulting in adverse effects on our company or our product candidates will not be adopted in a country in which we intend to operate and/or upon the distribution of our product candidates in the United States.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. The legislation imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on all U.S. medical device sales that began January 1, 2013. Under the law, the total cost to the medical device industry from the tax is expected to be approximately $29 billion over ten years. This significant increase in the tax burden on our industry could have a material, negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows, especially if the TARGT microorgan were determined to be a medical device. Other elements of this legislation, such as comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, payment system reforms, including shared savings pilots, and other provisions, could meaningfully change the way health care is developed and delivered, and may materially impact numerous aspects of our business.\nReimbursement policies of third-party payers may negatively affect the acceptance of our product candidates by subjecting the product candidates to sales and pharmaceutical pricing controls.\nThird-party payers (Medicare, Medicaid, private health insurance companies and other organizations) may affect the pricing or relative attractiveness of our product candidates by regulating the level of reimbursement provided to the physicians and clinics utilizing our product candidates or by refusing reimbursement. If reimbursement under these programs, or if the amount of time to secure reimbursement is too long, our ability to market our technology and product candidates may be adversely and materially affected. In international markets, reimbursement by private third-party medical insurance providers, including government insurers and independent providers, varies from country to country. In certain countries, our ability to achieve significant market penetration may depend upon the availability of third-party government reimbursement. Pharmaceutical pricing is also subject to regulation in Israel as well as other countries within which we may wish to distribute our product candidates.\nThe ACA reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals, clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies, and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures. Further, the Budget Control Act enacted in August 2011 committed the U.S. federal government to significantly reduce the federal deficit over ten years. In addition to placing caps on discretionary spending through 2021, the Budget Control Act also established a budget sequestration that calls for automatic spending cuts over a nine-year period. Across-the-board spending cuts went into effect on March 1, 2013, and Medicare spending cuts that reduce Part A and Part B payments by 2% went into effect on April 1, 2013. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, passed in December 2013, extends the sequestration automatic Medicare spending cuts to 2023 from 2021. Although we cannot predict the full effect on our business of the implementation of existing legislation such as the ACA and the Budget Control Act, or the enactment of additional legislation, we believe that legislation or regulation that reduces reimbursement for our products could adversely affect how much or under what circumstances health care providers will prescribe or administer our products. This could materially and adversely impact our business by reducing our ability to generate revenue, raise capital, obtain additional collaborators and market our products. In addition, we believe the increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of pharmaceutical products, which may adversely impact product sales.\nWe may experience product liability claims, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe may become subject to product liability claims. We have not experienced any product liability claims to date; however, the production at commercial scale, distribution, sale and support of our product candidates may entail the risk of such claims, which is likely to be substantial in light of the use of our product candidates in the treatment of medical conditions. We carry product liability insurance coverage in connection with our human trial of TARGTEPO, including the second generation expression cassette of the HDAd viral vector and implantation protocol which is projected to be conducted in Israel. Our insurance provides $5 million in coverage, subject to a $5,000 deductible. Our insurance must be renewed annually at a current cost of $19,000 per year to cover current and planned trials in Israel. If we are unable to obtain a renewal or if we suffer a successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage, such claim could result in significant monetary liability and could have a material adverse impact on our business, operations, financial position and/or reputation.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our results of operation could be harmed.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments. We continuously monitor our existing internal controls over financial reporting systems to confirm that they are compliant with Section 404, and we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadlines imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This process may divert internal resources and will take a significant amount of time and effort to complete.\nIf at any time it is determined that we are not in compliance with Section 404, we may be required to implement new internal control procedures and reevaluate our financial reporting. We may experience higher than anticipated operating expenses as well as increased independent auditor fees during the implementation of these changes and thereafter. Further, we may need to hire additional qualified personnel. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which could result in our being unable to obtain an unqualified report on internal controls from our independent auditors. Failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses, divert management\u2019s attention from operating our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere have been changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, as well as new regulations promulgated by the SEC and rules promulgated by the national securities exchanges, including the NYSE MKT. These new or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Our board members, principal executive officer and principal financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, we may incur additional expenses to comply with standards set by regulatory authorities or governing bodies which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations or clinical trials, compromise information belonging to us and our suppliers and expose us to liability, which could adversely impact our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including the conduct of our clinical trials. Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data, including proprietary business information. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, our information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. Any such event could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations and damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business.\nRisk Related to our Securities\nOur securities are thinly traded, resulting in relative illiquidity and price volatility, and there may not ever be an active market for our securities.\nAlthough our common stock and a class of our warrants have been traded on the NYSE MKT since April 2011, the volumes and trading in our securities have been extremely sporadic. As a result, the ability of holders to purchase or sell our securities is limited, with low-volume trading creating wide shifts in price. For our securities to continue to be listed on the NYSE MKT, we must meet the current listing requirements of that exchange. If we were unable to meet these requirements, our securities could be delisted from the NYSE MKT. Any such delisting of our securities could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our securities, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and less coverage of us by securities analysts, if any. Also, if in the future we were to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public or private equity markets.\nFurther, the share prices of public companies, particularly those operating in high growth sectors, are often subject to significant fluctuations. The market price of our common stock on the NYSE MKT has been volatile, ranging from $3.68 per share to $9.00 per share during the 52-week trading period ending February 9, 2015. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate significantly due to factors including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u00b7 announcements of developments by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u00b7 adoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 introduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 changes in market valuations of companies in our industry;\n\u00b7 general market conditions;\n\u00b7 future issuances of our common stock or other securities; and\n\u00b7 other events or factors, including those beyond our control.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate coverage or continue to cover our common stock, and this may have a negative impact on its market price.\nThe trading market for our securities could depend in part on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about our business and us. We do not have any control over these analysts. There is no guarantee that securities analysts will cover our securities. If securities analysts do not cover our securities, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect their market prices. If we are covered by securities analysts, and our securities are the subject of an unfavorable report, the prices for our securities would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price and/or trading volume to decline.\nThe exercise of options and warrants and other issuances of shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of common stock will dilute the ownership interests of our current stockholders and may adversely affect the future market price of our common stock.\nSales of our common stock in the public market, either by us or by our current stockholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause a decline in the market price of our securities. Nearly all of the shares of our common stock held by those of our current stockholders who are not affiliates may be immediately eligible for resale in the open market either in compliance with an exemption under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, or pursuant to an effective resale registration statement that we have previously filed with the SEC. Such sales, along with any other market transactions, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2014, there were outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 7,385,282 shares of our common stock at exercise prices ranging from 2.66 per share to $10.80 per share, of which options to purchase 3,392,411 shares were exercisable as of such date. As of December 31, 2014, there were warrants outstanding to purchase 9,195,665 shares of our common stock, at exercise prices ranging from $2.49 per share to $11.16 per share, with a weighted average exercise price of $6.24 per share, all of which were exercisable as of December 31, 2014. The exercise of options and warrants at prices below the market price of our common stock could adversely affect the price of shares of our common stock. In addition, some of the warrants have anti-dilution protection which will require us to lower the exercise price in the event we sell securities in the future at a price lower than the exercise price then in effect. Additional dilution may result from the issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with collaborations or manufacturing arrangements or in connection with other financing efforts.\nAny issuance of our common stock that is not made solely to then-existing stockholders proportionate to their interests, such as in the case of a stock dividend or stock split, will result in dilution to each stockholder by reducing his, her or its percentage ownership of the total outstanding shares. Moreover, if we issue options or warrants to purchase our common stock in the future and those options or warrants are exercised, stockholders may experience further dilution. In 2014, we issued 1,247,373 options resulting in significant dilution to our existing stockholders. Delaware law and our corporate governance documents do not prohibit the number of options that we may issue in the future, except to the extent we are limited by the number of our authorized shares of common stock which is currently 100,000,000 shares. Holders of shares of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle them to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series.\nOur principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our officers and directors together controlled approximately 26% of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, our five largest stockholders other than management and the directors controlled approximately 11% of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and therefore may not be in the best interest of our other stockholders.\nWe have never declared or paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, applicable contractual restrictions and other such factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nProvisions of Delaware law may delay or prevent efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, even if such acquisition were in the best interests of our stockholders.\nWe are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe will require additional capital in the future to continue and expand our research and development and other operations. We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, our common stock. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or sales of such other securities or the perception that such sales could occur.\nIsrael-Related Risks\nOur research and development activities occur primarily in Israel, and our company and our business could be adversely affected by the economic, political and military conditions in that region.\nOur principal research and development activities are based in Israel, which may be adversely affected by acts of terrorism, major hostilities, adverse legislation or litigation. If major hostilities should occur in the Middle East, including as a result of acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere, any such effects may not be covered by insurance. Our commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with the security situation in the Middle East, such as damages to our facilities and the resulting disruption to our ability to continue our product development. Although the Israeli government currently covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot be certain that this government coverage will be maintained or will be adequate in the event we submit a claim. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are directly affected by economic, political and military conditions in that country. Our Israeli facilities are located in Misgav in northern Israel. In December 2008, in November 2012 and again in the summer of 2014, armed conflicts occurred between Israel and Hamas, an Islamist terrorist group in the Gaza Strip, including targeting civilian targets in southern Israel and the western Negev region, as well as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. There can be no assurance that Hamas will not obtain and use longer-range missiles capable of reaching our facilities, which could result in a significant disruption of the Israel-based portion of our business.\nAny armed conflicts, terrorist activities or political instability in the region could adversely affect business conditions and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and may make it more difficult for us to raise necessary capital. For example, any major escalation in hostilities in the region could result in a portion of our employees, including officers, key personnel and consultants, being called up to perform military duty for an extended period of time. In addition, the political and security situation in Israel may result in parties with whom we have agreements involving performance in Israel claiming that they are not obligated to perform their commitments under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions in the agreements.\nIn addition to the foregoing, since the end of 2010, numerous acts of protest and civil unrest have taken place in several countries in the Middle East and North Africa, many of which involved significant violence. It cannot be predicted how the civil unrest in Egypt and the civil war in Syria or in other countries in the region will affect the political and security situation in the Middle East and on Israel\u2019s position within the region.\nOur operations may be disrupted by the obligations of our personnel to perform military service which could have a material adverse effect of our business.\nMany of our male employees in Israel are obligated to perform up to one month (in some cases more) of annual military reserve duty until they reach the age of 45 and, in the event of a military conflict, could be called to active duty. Our operations could be disrupted by the absence of a significant number of our employees related to military service or the absence for extended periods of military service of one or more of our key employees. A disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUnder current U.S. and Israeli law, we may not be able to enforce employees\u2019 covenants not to compete and therefore may be unable to prevent our competitors from benefiting from the expertise of some of our former employees.\nWe have entered in non-competition agreements with our key employees. These agreements prohibit our key employees, if they cease working for us, from competing directly with us or working for our competitors for a limited period. Under applicable U.S. and Israeli law, we may be unable to enforce these agreements. If we cannot enforce our non-competition agreements with our employees, then we may be unable to prevent our competitors from benefiting from the expertise of our former employees, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and ability to capitalize on our proprietary information.\nWe may experience foreign currency exchange risks, which may increase the dollar costs of our operations in Israel.\nA substantial portion of our expenses, including those related to our clinical trial, our research and development, personnel and facilities-related expenses is incurred in New Israeli Shekels (NIS). Inflation in Israel will have the effect of increasing the dollar cost of our operations in Israel, unless it is offset on a timely basis by a devaluation of the NIS relative to the U.S. dollar. This may give rise to an exchange rate risk against NIS. We do not currently engage in hedging or use any other financial instruments or arrangements to manage this risk.", "PERMNO": 12667, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "GNMX"}
