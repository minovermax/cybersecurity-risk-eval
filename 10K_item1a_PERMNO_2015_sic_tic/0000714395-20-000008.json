{"cik": "714395", "company": "GERMAN AMERICAN BANCORP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following describes some of the principal risks and uncertainties to which our industry in general, and our securities, assets and businesses specifically, are subject; other risks are briefly identified in our cautionary statement that is included under the heading \u201cForward-Looking Statements and Associated Risks\u201d in Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d Although we seek ways to manage these risks and uncertainties and to develop programs to control those that we can, we ultimately cannot predict the future. Future results may differ materially from past results, and from our expectations and plans.\nRisks Related to the Financial Services Industry\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and changes in laws and regulations to which we are subject may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe banking industry in which we operate is subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state laws and regulations. The restrictions imposed by such laws and regulations limit the manner in which we conduct our business, undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing. These regulations are designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers and not to benefit our shareholders. Financial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation in recent years and may be the subject of further significant legislation, none of which is in our control. Significant new laws or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws (including changes in federal or state laws affecting corporate taxpayers generally or financial institutions specifically) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Further, federal monetary policy, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve System, significantly affects credit conditions, and any unfavorable change in these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and regulations adopted under that law could materially and adversely affect us by increasing compliance costs and heightening our risk of noncompliance with applicable regulations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act (discussed in \"Business - Regulation and Supervision\" of Item 1 above) has resulted in sweeping changes in the regulation of financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous provisions that affect all banks and bank holding companies. Many of these provisions remain subject to regulatory rule-making and implementation, the effects of which are not yet known. Accordingly, we cannot predict the specific impact and long-term effects that the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder will have on us and our prospects, our target markets and the financial industry more generally. However, the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder have imposed additional administrative and regulatory burdens that obligate us to incur additional expenses (which adversely affect our margins and profitability) and increase the risk that we might not comply in all respects with the new requirements. Further, the CFPB\u2019s rule on qualified mortgages could limit our ability or desire to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive and/or time consuming to make these loans, which could adversely impact our growth or profitability.\nThe banking industry may be subject to new legislation, regulation, and government policy including possible amendments or revisions to the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and to CFPB rules and regulations. Future legislation, regulation, and government policy could affect the banking industry as a whole, including our business and results of operations, in ways that cannot accurately be predicted. In addition, our financial condition and results of operations also could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies.\nWe are required to maintain certain minimum amounts and types of capital and may be subject to more stringent capital requirements in the future. A failure to meet applicable capital requirements could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that we must maintain. From time to time, banking regulators change these capital adequacy guidelines. For example, as a result of the recently implemented \u201cBasel III\u201d capital reforms required by the Dodd-Frank Act, we are now required to satisfy additional, more stringent, capital adequacy standards than we had in the past. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation and Supervision, Capital Requirements\u201d of Item 1 above for additional information. We currently satisfy the well-capitalized and capital conservation standards set forth in Basel III, and based on our current capital composition and levels, we anticipate that our capital ratios, on a Basel III basis, will continue to exceed the well-capitalized minimum capital requirements and capital conservation buffer standards. However, a failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a negative impact on our ability to lend, grow deposit balances, make acquisitions or make capital distributions in the form of dividends. Higher capital levels could also lower our return on equity.\nAs discussed under \u201cBusiness - Regulation and Supervision Prompt, Corrective Action Classifications\u201d of Item I above, effective as of January 1, 2020, the Company and the Bank became eligible to opt-in to the CBLR framework, as provided for by the\nEconomic Growth Act, because they satisfy certain qualifying criteria, including having less than $10 billion in average total consolidated assets and a leverage ratio (referred to as the \u201ccommunity bank leverage ratio\u201d) of greater than 9%. The community bank leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization\u2019s \u201cCBLR tier 1 capital\u201d to its average total consolidated assets, both as reported on the banking organization\u2019s applicable regulatory filings. If this election is made, the Company and the Bank would satisfy their regulatory capital standards by calculating and reporting the community bank leverage ratio instead of the risk-weighted capital ratios and minimum leverage ratio currently required and would be deemed \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d under the FRB\u2019s and FDIC\u2019s Prompt Corrective Action rules so long as they continue to satisfy the qualifying criteria of the CBLR framework. The Company has not yet decided whether it will take advantage of the new CBLR framework or will continue with the existing layered ratio structure. Under either framework, the Company and the Bank would be considered well-capitalized under applicable guidelines.\nOur FDIC insurance premiums may increase, and special assessments could be made, which might negatively impact our results of operations.\nHigh levels of insured institution failures, as a result of the recent recession, significantly increased losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act mandated the FDIC to increase the level of its reserves for future losses in its Deposit Insurance Fund. Since the Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by premiums and assessments paid by insured banks, our FDIC insurance premium could increase in future years depending upon the FDIC\u2019s actual loss experience, changes in our Bank\u2019s financial condition or capital strength, and future conditions in the banking industry.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Financial Strategies\nEconomic weakness in our geographic markets could negatively affect us.\nWe conduct business from offices that are located in 20 contiguous southern Indiana counties and four counties in Kentucky, from which substantially all of our customer base is drawn. Because of the geographic concentration of our operations and customer base, our results depend largely upon economic conditions in this area. Any material deterioration in the economic conditions in these markets could have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us, or on our customers or on the financial institutions with whom we deal as counterparties to financial transactions. Such deterioration could negatively impact customers\u2019 ability to obtain new loans or to repay existing loans, diminish the values of any collateral securing such loans and could cause increases in the number of the Company\u2019s customers experiencing financial distress and in the levels of the Company\u2019s delinquencies, non-performing loans and other problem assets, charge-offs and provision for credit losses, all of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The underwriting and credit monitoring policies and procedures that we have adopted cannot eliminate the risk that we might incur losses on account of factors relating to the economy like those identified above, and those losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our actual loan losses exceed our estimates, our earnings and financial condition will be impacted.\nA significant source of risk for any bank or other enterprise that lends money arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail (because of financial difficulties or other reasons) to perform in accordance with the terms of their loan agreements. In our case, we originate many loans that are secured, but some loans are unsecured depending on the nature of the loan. With respect to secured loans, the collateral securing the repayment of these loans includes a wide variety of real and personal property that may be insufficient to cover the obligations owed under such loans, due to adverse changes in collateral values caused by changes in prevailing economic, environmental and other conditions, including declines in the value of real estate and other external events.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses to cover probable, incurred credit losses. The determination of the allowance is inherently subjective, as it requires significant estimates, including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on other classified loans and pools of homogeneous loans, and consideration of past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. Although our management has established an allowance for loan losses that it believes is adequate to absorb probable and reasonably estimable losses in our loan portfolio, this allowance may not be adequate. We could sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the amount of our allowance for loan losses.\nThe impact of adopting the new accounting standard for recording the allowance for credit losses is uncertain.\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, to replace the incurred\nloss model with an expected loss model, which is referred to as the current expected credit loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model. The CECL model is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, and reinsurance receivables. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor. This standard became effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period.\nASU 2016-13 requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. As of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective, the Company expects to recognize a one-time cumulative effect adjustment increasing the allowance for loan losses, since this ASU covers credit losses over the expected life of a loan as well as considering future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The Company currently estimates an increase to the allowance for credit losses of approximately $12 million to $20 million upon adoption, which is primarily related to our acquired loan portfolio. This estimate and the ongoing impact of adopting this ASU are dependent on various factors, including credit quality, macroeconomic forecasts and conditions, composition of our loans and securities portfolios, and other management judgements. The transition adjustment to record the allowance for credit losses, which remains subject to further review and analysis by our management team, may fall outside of our estimated increase based on material changes in these factors.\nOn December 21, 2018, federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to, among other things: (i) address the upcoming implementation of the CECL accounting standard under GAAP; and (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL. The Company anticipates adopting the capital transition relief over the permissible three-year period.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates.\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, demand for loans, securities and deposits, and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the monetary policies of the FRB. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. We maintain an investment portfolio consisting of various high quality liquid fixed-income securities. The nature of fixed-income securities is such that increases in prevailing market interest rates negatively impact the value of these securities, while decreases in prevailing market interest rates positively impact the value of these securities. Any substantial, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIncreased regulatory oversight, uncertainty relating to the LIBOR calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the results of our operations.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR, whether LIBOR rates will cease to be published or supported before or after 2021 or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Efforts in the United States to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes in other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based loans, and to a lesser extent securities in our portfolio, and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings, including the rates we pay on our subordinated debentures and trust preferred securities. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, any successor or replacement interest rates may perform differently and we may incur significant costs to transition both our borrowing arrangements and the loan agreements with our customers from LIBOR, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. The impact of alternatives to LIBOR on the valuations, pricing and operation of our financial instruments is not yet known.\nThe banking and financial services business in our markets is highly competitive.\nWe compete with much larger regional, national, and international competitors, including competitors that have no (or only a limited number of) offices physically located within our markets, many of which compete with us via Internet and other electronic product and service offerings. In addition, banking and other financial services competitors (including newly organized companies) that are not currently represented by physical locations within our geographic markets could establish office facilities within our markets, including through their acquisition of existing competitors. In December 2016, the OCC announced its intent to make\nspecial purpose national bank charters available to financial technology companies. While the agency issued a draft supplement to its licensing manual in March 2017, providing more details on how companies applying for such charters would be evaluated, the OCC has not given any definitive indication as to whether or not it intends to move forward in making such special purpose charters available to financial technology companies. In any event, developments increasing the nature or level of our competition, or decreasing the effectiveness by which we compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. See also \u201cBusiness - Competition\u201d and \u201cBusiness - Regulation and Supervision\u201d under Item 1 of Part I of this Report.\nThe manner in which we report our financial condition and results of operations may be affected by accounting changes.\nOur financial condition and results of operations that are presented in our consolidated financial statements, accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements, and selected financial data appearing in this Report, are, to a large degree, dependent upon our accounting policies. The selection of and application of these policies involve estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are subject to change, and the effect of any change in estimates or judgments that might be caused by future developments or resolution of uncertainties could be materially adverse to our reported financial condition and results of operations. In addition, authorities that prescribe accounting principles and standards for public companies from time to time change those principles or standards or adopt formal or informal interpretations of existing principles or standards. Such changes or interpretations (to the extent applicable to us) could result in changes that would be materially adverse to our reported financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in tax laws.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), which was enacted in December 2017, reduced the federal tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21%. While our earnings have been positively impacted by the rate reduction and the resulting increase in economic activity, the Tax Act also enacted limitations on certain deductions that will have an impact on the banking industry, borrowers and the market for single-family residential real estate. These limitations include (1) a lower limit on the deductibility of mortgage interest on single-family residential mortgage loans, (2) the elimination of interest deductions for certain home equity loans, (3) a limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, and (4) a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes and state and local income taxes. Given the current economic and political environment and ongoing budgetary pressures, the enactment of further new federal or state tax legislation may occur. The enactment of such legislation, or changes in the interpretation of existing law, including provisions impacting tax rates, apportionment, consolidation or combination, income, expenses, credits and exemptions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of securities or loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or the terms of which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and borrowings as necessary, we might not be able to replace such funds in the future if, among other things, our results of operations or financial condition or the results of operations or financial condition of our lenders or market conditions were to change.\nThe value of securities in our investment securities portfolio may be negatively affected by disruptions in securities markets.\nPrices and volumes of transactions in the nation\u2019s securities markets can be affected suddenly by economic crises, or by other national or international crises, such as national disasters, acts of war or terrorism, changes in commodities markets, or instability in foreign governments. Disruptions in securities markets may detrimentally affect the value of securities that we hold in our investment portfolio, such as through reduced valuations due to the perception of heightened credit and liquidity risks. There can be no assurance that declines in market value associated with these disruptions will not result in other than temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our\ncounterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount due us.\nWe are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel could harm our business.\nCompetition for qualified employees and personnel in the financial services industry (including banking personnel, trust and investments personnel, and insurance personnel) is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of and experience in our local Southern Indiana markets. Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain qualified loan origination executives, sales executives for our trust and investment products and services, and sales executives for our insurance products and services. We also depend upon the continued contributions of our management personnel, and in particular upon the abilities of our senior executive management, and the loss of the services of one or more of them could harm our business.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective.\nThe Company maintains a comprehensive risk management program designed to identify, quantify, manage, mitigate, monitor, aggregate, and report risks. However, instruments, systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, financial reporting and strategic risks could be less effective than anticipated. As a result, the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For more information regarding risk management, please see \u201cRISK MANAGEMENT\u201d under Item 7 of this Report (\u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d).\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title.\nIn the course of our business, we may own or foreclose and take title to real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties (including liabilities for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination), or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe face significant operational risks due to the high volume and the high dollar value nature of transactions we process.\nWe operate in many different businesses in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of our internal control systems or failures of those of our suppliers or counterparties, compliance failures, cyber-attacks or unforeseen problems encountered while implementing new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems, business continuation and disaster recovery issues, and other external events. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. The occurrence of any of these events could cause us to suffer financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to our reputation.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information, whether through a cyber-attack, other breach of our computer systems or otherwise, could harm our business.\nIn the normal course of our business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential client and customer information on our behalf and on behalf of other third parties. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and / or human errors, or other similar events.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions like us have increased recently in part because of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions, particularly denial of service attacks, designed to disrupt key business services such as customer-facing web sites. We may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types. Although we employ detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents, early detection may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection.\nWe also face risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers through various third parties. Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyber-attacks, and because the transactions involve third parties and environments that we do not control or secure, future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these third parties could impact us through no fault of our own, and in some cases we may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them. We also rely on numerous other third party service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations and face similar risks relating to them. We cannot be sure that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyber-attack or other security breach.\nAny cyber-attack or other security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information could severely damage our reputation, erode confidence in the security of our systems, products and services, expose us to the risk of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption, or security breach of our information systems, we cannot completely ensure that any such failures, interruptions, or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon third parties for certain information system, data management and processing services and to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nWe outsource certain information system and data management and processing functions to third party providers. These third party service providers are sources of operational and informational security risk to us, including risks associated with operational errors, information system interruptions or breaches, and unauthorized disclosures of sensitive or confidential client or customer information. If third party service providers encounter any of these issues, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, we could be exposed to disruption of operations, loss of service or connectivity to customers, reputational damage, and litigation risk that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or our business.\nThird party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and core application processing.\nWhile we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct our business. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nRisks Relating to Expansion of Our Businesses by Acquisition\nAny acquisitions of banks, bank branches, or loans or other financial service assets pose risks to us.\nWe may acquire other banks, bank branches and other financial-service-related businesses and assets in the future. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022\npotential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired assets, operations or company;\n\u2022\nexposure to potential asset quality issues of the acquired assets, operations or company;\n\u2022\nenvironmental liability with acquired real estate collateral or other real estate;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and expense of integrating the operations, systems and personnel of the acquired assets, operations or company;\n\u2022\npotential disruption to our ongoing business, including diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u2022\nthe possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired operations or company;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in estimating the value of the acquired assets, operations or company; and\n\u2022\npotential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the acquired assets, operations or company.\nWe may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with mergers or acquisitions.\nAcquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of the Company\u2019s tangible book value per common share or net income per common share (or both) may occur in connection with any future transaction.\nWe may incur substantial costs to expand by acquisition, and such acquisitions may not result in the levels of profits we seek.\nIntegration efforts for any future acquisitions may not be successful and following any future acquisition, after giving it effect, we may not achieve financial results comparable to or better than our historical experience.\nWe may participate in FDIC-assisted acquisitions, which could present additional risks to our financial condition.\nWe may make opportunistic whole or partial acquisitions of troubled financial institutions in transactions facilitated by the FDIC. In addition to the risks frequently associated with acquisitions, an acquisition of a troubled financial institution may involve a greater risk that the acquired assets underperform compared to our expectations. Because these acquisitions are structured in a manner that would not allow us the time normally associated with preparing for and evaluating an acquisition, including preparing for integration of an acquired institution, we may face additional risks including, among other things, the loss of customers, strain on management resources related to collection and management of problem loans and problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems. Additionally, while the FDIC may agree to assume certain losses in transactions that it facilitates, there can be no assurances that we would not be required to raise additional capital as a condition to, or as a result of, participation in an FDIC-assisted transaction. Any such transactions and related issuances of stock may have dilutive effect on earnings per share and share ownership.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock price may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell our common stock at times or at prices acceptable to you.\nOur common stock price constantly changes in response to a variety of factors (some of which are beyond our control), and we expect that our stock price will continue to fluctuate in the future. Factors impacting the price of our common stock include, among others:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\nrecommendations or research reports about us or the financial services industry in general published by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover, or continue to cover, us;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us;\n\u2022\nnews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding us, or our reputation, competitors or other financial institutions;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated sales of our equity or equity-related securities;\n\u2022\nour past and future dividend practice;\n\u2022\ndeparture of our management team or other key personnel;\n\u2022\nnew technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n\u2022\nexisting or increased regulatory and compliance requirements, changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations, or differing interpretations thereof affecting our business, or enforcement of these laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nlitigation and governmental investigations.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events (such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends) could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.", "PERMNO": 79166, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "GABC"}
