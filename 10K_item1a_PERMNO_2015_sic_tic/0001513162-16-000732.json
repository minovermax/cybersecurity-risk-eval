Risk Factors\nOur results of operations and financial condition can be adversely affected by numerous risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this document. Should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted.\nAs a result of our reliance on foreign sourcing for our products:\n\u00b7 Our ability to service customers could be adversely affected and result in lower sales, earnings and liquidity.\nOur supply of goods could be interrupted for a variety of reasons. Physical damage from a natural disaster, fire or other cause to any one of our sourcing partners\u2019 factories could interrupt production for an extended period of time. We may reject goods that do not meet our specifications causing delays to the receipt of goods and/or requiring us to identify and utilize alternative sourcing arrangements at a higher cost, or possibly forcing us to discontinue the product. Also, delivery of goods from our foreign sourcing partners may be delayed for reasons not typically encountered with domestic manufacturing or sourcing, such as shipment delays caused by customs or labor issues.\n\u00b7 Our ability to properly forecast customer demand while operating within the inherent extended lead times of an overseas sourcing model could result in lower sales, earnings and liquidity.\nExtended lead times may adversely affect our ability to respond to sudden changes in demand, resulting in the purchase of excess inventory in the face of declining demand, or lost sales due to insufficient inventory in the face of increasing demand, either of which could have an adverse effect on our sales, earnings and liquidity.\n\u00b7 Changes in political, economic and social conditions, as well as laws and regulations, in the countries from which we source products could adversely affect us.\nForeign sourcing is subject to political and social instability in countries where our sourcing partners are located. This could make it more difficult for us to service our customers. Also, significant fluctuations of foreign exchange rates against the value of the U.S. dollar could increase our costs, decrease earnings and/or negatively affect the business of our suppliers overseas.\n\u00b7 International trade policies of the United States and countries from which we source products could adversely affect us.\nImposition of trade sanctions relating to imports, taxes, import duties and other charges on imports could limit our ability to source product from the impacted countries and increase our costs, thus decreasing our earnings.\n\u00b7 Changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to the currencies for the countries from which we obtain our products or other influential foreign currencies, could adversely affect our sales, earnings and liquidity.\nFor imported products, we generally negotiate firm pricing with our foreign suppliers in U.S. Dollars, typically for periods of at least one year. We accept the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods. We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk but could choose to do so in the future. Since we transact our imported product purchases in U.S. Dollars, a relative decline in the value of the U.S Dollar could increase the price we must pay for imported products beyond the negotiated periods. In addition, valuation changes in other leading foreign countries could adversely affect the business of our sourcing partners and therefore, adversely affect us. These price changes could decrease our sales, earnings and liquidity during affected periods.\nWe are currently transitioning the manufacturing of substantially all our products to a single contract manufacturer and the loss of this contract manufacturer, or its inability to satisfy our quality or other requirements, could severely disrupt the production and supply of our products resulting in lower sales, earnings and liquidity.\nWe are in the process of transitioning the manufacturing of substantially all our products to a single contract manufacturer located outside Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam in connection with our strategic manufacturing alliance with Starwood Manufacturing VN Corporation. Any financial, operational or other difficulties involving this manufacturer could adversely affect us. The loss of our relationship with our manufacturer, or its inability to conduct its manufacturing services for us as anticipated in terms of cost, quality, and timeliness, could adversely affect our ability to fill customer orders. In addition, it could be costly and require a long period of time to move products to another manufacturer. If any of these were to occur, the supply of our products could be severely disrupted resulting in lower sales, earnings and liquidity.\nWe may not be able to maintain or to raise prices in response to inflation and/or increasing costs.\nFuture market and competitive pressures may prohibit us from successfully raising prices to offset increased costs of finished goods, freight and other inflationary items. This could lower our earnings.\nWe may not be able to sustain sales, earnings and liquidity levels due to economic downturns.\nThe furniture industry historically has been cyclical in nature and has fluctuated with economic cycles. During economic downturns, the furniture industry tends to experience longer periods of recession and greater declines than the general economy. We believe that the industry is significantly influenced by economic conditions generally and particularly by housing activity, consumer confidence, the level of personal discretionary spending, demographics and credit availability. As a result, a worsening of current conditions could lower our sales and earnings and impact our liquidity.\nBusiness failures, or the loss, of large customers could result in a decrease in our future sales and earnings.\nAlthough we have no single customer representing 10% or more of our total annual sales, the possibility of business failures, or the loss of large customers could result in a decrease of our future sales and earnings. Lost sales may be difficult to replace and any amounts owed to us may become uncollectible.\nFailure to anticipate or respond to changes in customer tastes, fashions and perceived values in a timely manner could result in a decrease in our sales and earnings.\nResidential furniture is a fashion business based upon products styled for a changing marketplace and is sometimes subject to changing consumer trends and tastes. If we are unable to predict or respond to changes in these trends and tastes in a timely manner, we may lose sales and have to sell excess inventory at reduced prices. This could lower our sales and earnings.\nWe may not be able to sustain current sales and earnings due to the actions and strength of our competitors.\nThe furniture industry is very competitive and fragmented. We compete with a host of varying business models within the industry including but not limited to former manufacturers who have adopted a strictly pass-through model from overseas vendor to wholesale customers: national lifestyle retailers who sell directly to the retail consumer through an omni-channel distribution and marketing model; overseas vendors who sell directly to wholesale customers. Some competitors have greater financial resources and often offer extensively advertised, highly promoted products. As a result, we are continually subject to the risk of losing market share, which may lower our sales and earnings.\nOur liquidity could be negatively impacted by the potential instability of Genworth Life Insurance Company.\nWe currently have available $22.3 million of net cash surrender value in corporate-owned life insurance policies with Genworth Life Insurance Company. If the financial stability of Genworth Life Insurance Company was to deteriorate to a point that insolvency was likely, our access to these funds may be limited or eliminated. Although management monitors the financial stability of Genworth Life Insurance Company on a regular basis, insolvency could occur and, as a result, impact our liquidity. Genworth Life Insurance Company is a subsidiary of Genworth Financial, Inc., which recently reported a Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 operating loss in its U.S. Life Insurance segment. The company also announced that it was suspending traditional life and fixed annuity sales. After this announcement, Genworth Life Insurance Company\u2019s ratings from the following rating agencies were downgraded to those set forth below:\n\u00b7 A.M. Best: B++ (Good)\n\u00b7 Standard & Poor\u2019s: BB (Marginal)\n\u00b7 Moody\u2019s: Ba1 (Questionable)\nOur business and operations would be adversely impacted in the event of a failure or interruption of our information technology infrastructure.\nThe proper functioning of our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business. If our information technology systems fail or are interrupted, our operations may be adversely affected and operating results could be harmed. Our information technology systems, and those of third parties providing service to us, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control. These include catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, viruses or malware, physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized access and cyber-attacks. Any material disruption, malfunction or similar challenges with our information technology infrastructure, or disruptions or challenges relating to the transition to new processes, systems or providers, could have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business and our results of operations.\nWe depend on key personnel and could be affected by the loss of their services.\nThe success of our business depends upon the services of certain senior executives. The loss of any such person or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFuture cost of compliance with environmental, safety and health regulations could reduce our earnings.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the areas of safety, health and environmental protection. The timing and ultimate magnitude of costs for compliance with environmental, health and safety regulations are difficult to predict and could reduce our earnings.", "PERMNO": 78068, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "STLY"}
