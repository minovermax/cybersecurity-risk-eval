{"cik": "1463972", "company": "Vuzix Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. An investor should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this annual report, before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer as a result of these risks. In that case, the market value of our securities could decline, and an investor may lose all or part of his or her investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception and if we continue to incur net losses in the foreseeable future the market price of our common stock may decline.\nWe reported a net loss of $19,250,082 for the year ended December 31, 2016, and we reported a net loss of $13,427,478 for the year ended December 31, 2015. We have an accumulated deficit of $94,541,168 as of December 31, 2016.\nWe may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. We will need to increase sales in order to achieve and maintain profitability. In addition, we expect that our expenses relating to product development and research, sales and marketing, as well as our general and administrative costs, may increase. If we do not achieve and maintain profitability, our financial condition will ultimately be materially and adversely affected and we would eventually be required to raise additional capital. We may not be able to raise any necessary capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to achieve or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis within the timeframe expected by investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nRISK FACTOR SECTION\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, our management determined that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, which could result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). As of December 31, 2016, our management has determined that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, while extensively remediated in 2016, have not been in operation long enough to demonstrate the repeatability and sustainability of their effectiveness in all areas. Accordingly, management has concluded that material weaknesses continued to exist as of December 31, 2016.\nDuring 2016, we hired additional staff and made extensive use of consultants to assist management with implementing improved controls. We implemented remedial measures throughout our financial reporting areas that address our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls during our 2016 fiscal year. If other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur, we may fail to meet our future reporting obligations on a timely basis, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements, we could be required to restate our prior period financial results, our operating results may be harmed, and we may be subject to class action litigation. Any failure to address the ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures could also adversely affect the results of the periodic management evaluations regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures that are required to be included in our annual report on Form 10-K. Internal control deficiencies and ineffective disclosure controls and procedures could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. We can give no assurance yet that all the measures we have taken will on a permanent and sustainable basis remediate the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures or that any other material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or adequate disclosure controls and procedures or circumvention of these controls. In addition, those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, which could result in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our revenue and profitability.\nThe market for head worn display devices, including Video Eyewear and Smart Glasses, is highly competitive. Further, we expect competition to intensify in the future as existing competitors introduce new and more competitive offerings alongside their existing products, and as new market entrants introduce new products into our markets. We compete against established, well-known diversified consumer electronics manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics Co., Sony Corporation, LG Electronics (LGE), HTC, Lenovo, and large software and other products companies such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Snap. Many of our current competitors have substantial market share, diversified product lines, well-established supply and distribution systems, strong worldwide brand recognition and greater financial, marketing, research and development and other resources than we do. In addition, many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as:\n\u00b7 longer operating histories;\n\u00b7 the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products;\n\u00b7 broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners;\n\u00b7 access to larger established customer bases;\n\u00b7 greater resources to fund research and development and to make acquisitions;\n\u00b7 larger intellectual property portfolios; and\n\u00b7 the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services.\nMoreover, smartphones, tablets and new wearable devices with ever growing larger video display screens and computing power have significantly improved the mobile personal computing experience. It is possible that, in the future, the manufacturers of these devices, such as Apple Inc., Samsung, LGE, Fitbit, Google, Snap, Garmin, Microsoft and others may design or develop products similar to ours. In addition to competition or potential competition from large, established companies, new companies may emerge and offer competitive products. Increased competition may result in pricing pressures and reduced profit margins and may impede our ability to increase the sales of our products, any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nOur lack of long-term purchase orders and commitments from our customers may lead to a rapid decline in our sales and profitability.\nAll of our customers issue purchase orders solely at their own discretion, often shortly before the requested date of shipment. Our customers are generally able to cancel orders (without penalty) or delay the delivery of products on relatively short notice. In addition, our current customers may decide not to purchase products from us for any reason. If those customers do not continue to purchase our products, our sales volume and profitability could decline rapidly with little or no warning.\nWe cannot rely on long-term purchase orders or commitments to protect us from the negative financial effects of a decline in demand for our products. We typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. The uncertainty of product orders makes it difficult for us to forecast our sales and allocate our resources in a manner consistent with our actual sales. Moreover, our expense levels and the amounts we invest in capital equipment and new product development costs are based in part on our expectations of future sales and, if our expectations regarding future sales are inaccurate, we may be unable to reduce costs in a timely manner to adjust for sales shortfalls. Furthermore, because we have historically often depended on a small number of customers for the majority of our sales, the ramifications of these risks is greater than if we had a greater number of customers. As a result of our lack of long-term purchase orders and purchase commitments, we may experience a rapid decline in our sales and profitability.\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors should not rely on our revenues and our operating results for any one quarter or year as an indication of our future revenues or operating results. If our quarterly revenues or results of operations fall below expectations of investors or public market analysts, the price of our common stock could fall substantially.\nIf we do not effectively maintain and further develop our sales channels for our products, including developing and supporting our retail sales channel, value added resellers (VARs) and distributors, our business could be harmed.\nWe depend upon effective sales channels to assist us in reaching the customers who are the ultimate purchasers of our Video Eyewear and Smart Glass products. In the United States, we primarily sell our products directly from our in-house sales team, our website, VARs and for our more consumer focused products through a mix of specialty retailers and online stores, some of which we reach certain U.S. markets through distributors. In international markets, we primarily sell directly to consumers, enterprises, VARs or occasionally through distributors who in turn sell to local retailers.\nOur distributors and VARs generally offer products from several different manufacturers. Accordingly, we are at risk that these distributors and VARs may give higher priority to selling other companies\u2019 products. If we were to lose the services of a distributor or VAR, we might need to find another in that area, and there can be no assurance of our ability to do so in a timely manner or on favorable terms. Further, our distributors can at times build inventories in anticipation of future sales, and if such sales do not occur as rapidly as they anticipate, our distributors will decrease the size of their future product orders. We are also subject to the risks of our distributors and VARs encountering financial difficulties, which could impede their effectiveness and also expose us to financial risk if they are unable to pay for the products they purchase from us. Any reduction in sales by our current distributors or VARs, loss of key distributors and VARs or decrease in revenue from our distributors and VARs could adversely affect our revenue, operating results and financial condition.\nOur future growth and profitability may be adversely affected if our marketing initiatives are not effective in generating sufficient levels of brand awareness.\nOur future growth and profitability from our consumer and enterprise products will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing efforts, including our ability to:\n\u00b7 create awareness of our brand and products;\n\u00b7 convert consumer awareness into actual product purchases;\n\u00b7 effectively manage marketing costs (including creative and media) in order to maintain acceptable operating margins and return on marketing investment;\n\u00b7 successfully offer to sell our products or license our technology to third party companies for sale under their own brand name as OEM partners;\nOur planned marketing expenditures may not result in increased total sales or generate sufficient levels of product and brand name awareness. We may not be able to manage our marketing expenditures on a cost-effective basis.\nIf we fail to accurately forecast seasonal demand for our consumer Video Eyewear products, our results of operations for the entire fiscal year may be materially adversely affected.\nHistorically, a high percentage of our consumer Video Eyewear product annual sales have been attributable to the winter holiday selling season. Like many manufacturers of consumer electronics products, we must make merchandising and inventory decisions for the winter holiday selling season well in advance of actual sales. Further compounding the difficulty of this forecasting are other fluctuations in demand for the consumer electronics products that work with our Video Eyewear products, often due to the same seasonal influences, as well as technological advances and new models which are often introduced later in the calendar year. Inaccurate projections of demand or deviations in the demand for our products may cause large fluctuations in our fourth quarter results and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year.\nIn contrast, a substantial portion of our expenses are personnel related and include salaries, stock-based compensation, benefits and research and development expenses, which are not seasonal in nature. Accordingly, in the event of revenue shortfalls, we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on our results from operations in the short term.\nOur products require ongoing research and development and we may experience technical problems or delays, which could lead our business to fail.\nOur research and development efforts remain subject to all of the risks associated with the development of new products based on emerging and innovative technologies, including, for example, unexpected technical problems or the possible insufficiency of funds for completing development of these products. If we experience technical problems or delays, further improvements in our products and the introduction of future products could be delayed, and we could incur significant additional expenses and our business may fail.\nWe depend on advances in technology by other companies and if those advances do not materialize, some of our anticipated new products could be delayed or cancelled.\nWe rely on and will continue to rely on technologies (including microdisplays) that are developed and produced by other companies. The commercial success of certain of our planned future products will depend in part on advances in these and other technologies by other companies. We may, from time to time, contract with and support companies developing key technologies in order to accelerate the development of them for our specific uses. Such activities might not result in useful technologies or components for us. We are attempting to mitigate this risk by exploring ways to develop our own microdisplay technologies using LED and laser scanning displays, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so.\nIf we fail to keep pace with changing technologies or are unable to anticipate customer preferences, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nRapidly changing customer requirements, evolving technologies and industry standards characterize the consumer electronics, mobile devises, smart phone, and display industries. To achieve our goals, we need to enhance our existing products and develop and market new products that keep pace with continuing changes in industry standards, requirements and customer preferences.\nOur success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing customer demands in a timely manner. If we are unable to introduce new products or novel technologies in a timely manner or our new products or technologies are not accepted by customers, our competitors may introduce more attractive products, which could hurt our competitive position. Our new products might not receive customer acceptance if their preferences shift to other products, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. Failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower revenue and excess inventory levels.\nIf microdisplay-based personal displays do not gain some reasonable level of acceptance in the market for mobile displays, our business strategy may fail.\nThe mobile display market is dominated by displays larger than one-inch, most of which are based on direct view liquid crystal display, or LCD and organic light emitting display, or OLED technology. A number of companies have made and continue to make substantial investments in, and are conducting research to improve characteristics of, small direct view LCDs. Many of the leading manufacturers of these larger direct view LCDs, including LG Electronics, Royal Philips Electronics, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Sony Corporation, HiMax, Omnivision, Citizen, and Sharp Corporation, are large, established companies with global marketing capabilities, widespread brand recognition and extensive financial resources. Advances in direct view LCD and OLED technology or other technologies may overcome their current limitations and permit them to remain or become more attractive technologies for personal viewing applications, which could limit the potential market for our Video Eyewear technology and cause our business strategy to fail.\nAnother product incorporating recently developed technology is a handheld projector that utilizes microdisplays and optics to project digital images onto any nearby viewing surface, such as a wall. These devices are referred to as pocket projectors or Pico projectors and are designed to overcome the limitations of the native small screen on smartphones and other mobile devices. As a result, we view Pico projector as a competitive alternative to our mobile displays. Pico projectors use either liquid crystal on silicon displays (LCOS), digital light processing displays (DLP) or color lasers to create their image. To date, we believe Pico projectors have had higher unit sales than Video Eyewear primarily because of their cost advantage, which results from their requiring only a single display. Pico projectors have recently been incorporated into cellular phones in an effort to produce a shareable large screen that is easier to view.\nRecently introduced head worn goggle attachments for smart phones, like the Samsung Gear VR, the Carl Zeiss VR One and the Google Cardboard can offer an inexpensive way for owners of compatible smart phones to experience virtual reality by taking advantage of the smart phone\u2019s display. These systems require pre-formatted video content and simple optics, to allow the wearer to view the screens less than 1\u201d for the wearer\u2019s eyes.\nIt is difficult to assess or predict with any certainty the potential size, timing and viability of market opportunities for our microdisplay-based Video Eyewear products or their level of market acceptance. Market acceptance of Video Eyewear technology will depend, in part, upon consumer acceptance of near-to-eye displays and upon microdisplay technology providing benefits comparable to or greater than those provided by alternative direct view display technology at a competitive price. Video Eyewear products work best when used close to the eye, which may not be acceptable to consumers. Such acceptance may depend on the relative complexity, reliability, usefulness and cost-effectiveness of our near-eye display products compared to other display products available in the market or that may be developed by our competitors. In addition, our products are not designed for a shared experience amongst multiple viewers at the same time. Potential customers may be reluctant to adopt our Video Eyewear products because of concerns surrounding perceived risks relating to use and the fact that it is a new technology. If consumers fail to accept near-to-eye displays in the numbers we anticipate or as soon as we anticipate, the sales of our Video Eyewear products and our results of operations would be adversely affected and our business strategy may fail.\nThere are a number of competing providers of microdisplay-based personal display technology, including smart glasses, and we may fail to capture a substantial portion of the personal display market.\nIn addition to competing with direct view displays, we also compete with microdisplay-based personal display technologies that have been developed by other companies. Our primary personal display competitors include Carl Zeiss, Inc., Sony, Epson, Google, Brother International, 5DT Inc., eMagin Corporation, Facebook (Oculus VR), Avegant, Kopin Corporation (Kopin), Lenovo, HTC, MicroVision, Inc. (Microvision), Lumus Ltd. (Lumus), Kaiser Electro Optics Inc., ODG, Toshiba, Razer, Garmin, Optinvent, HTC Value, LGE, TDG Acquisition Company, LLC, and Accupix of Korea. Samsung since September 2014 has been shipping a head worn goggle frame, called the Gear VR which allow users to mount their smart phones inside it to create an Oculus content compatible immersive VR system. There are similar smart phone mounting and viewing systems now available from a variety of manufactures ranging from simple ones like the Google Cardboard and their latest Daydream smart phone holder, which can turn compatible android phones into a display device complete with an interactive controller for VR content. Numerous other start-up companies have announced their intentions to offer AR smart glass and VR products and developer kits in the near future. Further, industry blogs have speculated that companies such as Apple may offer or support VR and AR Video Eyewear products in the near future. Microsoft in 2015 introduced its Hololens project, a head worn AR smart glass helmet with transparent holographic optics. Another new company, Magic Leap says it is working on a head-mounted virtual display system for AR applications; however, no details have been public regarding its technical capabilities or release date.\nThe Gear VR, Zeiss VR One, and even Google Daydream and Cardboard utilize the wearer\u2019s existing smart phone rather than microdisplays, which reduces the cost of these VR systems substantially, assuming the customer already owns the compatible smart phone. Such systems can be also be used for playing games and watching videos, making them a competitive and lower cost alternative to our iWear Video Eyewear products for big screen viewing on a smart phone. Most of our competitors have greater financial, marketing, distribution and technical resources than we do. Moreover, our competitors may succeed in developing new microdisplay-based personal display technologies and near-eye products that are more affordable or have more or more desirable features than our technology. If our products are unable to capture a reasonable portion of the personal display market, our business strategy may fail.\nOur business and products are subject to government regulation and we may incur additional compliance costs or, if we fail to comply with applicable regulations, may incur fines or be forced to suspend or cease operations.\nOur products must comply with certain requirements of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulating electromagnetic radiation in order to be sold in the United States and with comparable requirements of the regulatory authorities of the European Union, or EU, China and other jurisdictions in order to be sold in those jurisdictions. Our smart glasses products include wireless radios and receivers which require additional emission testing. We are also subject to various environmental laws and governmental regulations related to toxic, volatile, and other hazardous chemicals used in the third party components incorporated into our products, including the Restriction of Certain Hazardous Substances Directive, or RoHS and the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, or the WEEE Directive, as well as the implementing legislation of the EU member states. This directive restricts the distribution of products within the EU that exceed very low maximum concentration amounts of certain substances, including lead. Similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in China, South Korea, Norway and Japan and may be enacted in other regions, including in the United States, and we are, or may in the future be, subject to these laws and regulations.\nWe believe that all our current products comply with the regulations of the jurisdictions in which they are sold. From time to time, our products are subject to new domestic and international requirements. Compliance with regulations enacted in the future could substantially increase our cost of doing business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our business. Any inability by us to comply with regulations in the future could result in the imposition of fines or in the suspension or cessation of our operations or sales in the applicable jurisdictions. Any such inability by us to comply with regulations may also result in our not being permitted, or limit our ability to ship our products, which would adversely affect our revenue and ability to achieve or maintain profitability.\nAlthough we have policies and procedures in place requiring our contract manufacturers and major component suppliers to comply with the RoHS Directive requirements, we cannot provide assurance that our manufacturers and suppliers consistently comply with these requirements. In addition, if there are changes to these or other laws (or their interpretation) or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions, we may be required to re-engineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations. This re-engineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics.\nThe WEEE Directive requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection, recycling and treatment of such products. Changes in interpretation of the directive may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements to meet in the future in order to comply with this directive, or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with past, present and future similar laws could result in reduced sales of our products, substantial product inventory write-offs, reputational damage, penalties and other sanctions, which could harm our business and financial condition. We also expect that our products will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. To date, our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows and, although we cannot predict the future impact of such laws or regulations, they will likely result in additional costs and may increase penalties associated with violations or require us to change the content of our products or how they are manufactured, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur products may be subject to future health and safety regulations that could increase our development and production costs.\nProducts incorporating microdisplays and wearable computers could become subject to new health and safety regulations that would reduce our ability to commercialize these near-eye display products. Compliance with any such new regulations could increase our cost to develop and produce products using the microdisplay display engine and adversely affect our financial results.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain materials used in the manufacturing of our products.\nAs a public company, we are subject to requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, that require us to determine, disclose and report whether or not our products contain conflict minerals. The implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of the materials used in the manufacture of components used in our products. In addition, we have and will continue to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. It is also possible that we may face reputational harm if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to alter our products, processes or sources of supply to avoid such materials.\nOur products will likely experience rapidly declining unit prices and we may not be able to offset that decline with production cost decreases or higher unit sales.\nIn the markets in which we compete, prices of established consumer electronics display and mobile products tend to decline significantly over time. In order to maintain our profit margins over the long term, we believe that we will need to continuously develop product enhancements and new technologies that will either slow price declines of our products or reduce the cost of producing and delivering our products. While we anticipate many opportunities to reduce production costs over time, we may not be able to reduce our component costs. We expect to attempt to offset the anticipated decrease in our average selling price by introducing new products, increasing our sales volumes or adjusting our product mix. If we fail to do so, our results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we cannot obtain and maintain appropriate patent and other intellectual property rights protection for our technology, our business will suffer.\nThe value of our personal display, smart glasses and related technologies is dependent on our ability to secure and maintain appropriate patent and other intellectual property rights protection. We intend to continue to pursue additional patent protection for our new products and technology. Although we own many patents covering our technology that have already been issued, we may not be able to obtain additional patents that we apply for, our patents may be found invalid if challenged and our patents may not afford the degree of protection that we desire or require.\nAny patent or trademark owned by us may be challenged and invalidated or circumvented. Patents may not issue from any of our pending or future patent applications. Any claims and issued patents or pending patent applications may not be broad or strong enough to adequately protect our business. Effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries.\nUnauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise use aspects of our processes and products that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary information and technology is difficult and can be costly, and our efforts to do so may not prevent misappropriation of our technologies. We may become engaged in litigation to protect or enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights or in International Trade Commission proceedings to abate the importation of goods that would compete unfairly with our products and, if unsuccessful, these actions could result in the loss of patent or other intellectual property rights protection for the key technologies on which our business strategy depends.\nWe rely in part on unpatented proprietary technology, and others may independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology. We require employees, consultants, financial advisors, suppliers and strategic partners to enter into confidentiality agreements, but these agreements may not provide sufficient protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information\nOur products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.\nCompanies in the consumer electronics, wireless communications, semiconductor and display industries steadfastly pursue and protect intellectual property rights. This has resulted in considerable and costly litigation to determine the validity of patents and claims by third parties of infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights. Our products could be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. Other companies may hold or obtain patents or inventions or other proprietary rights in technology necessary for our business. Periodically, other companies inquire about our products and technology in their attempts to assess whether we violate their intellectual property rights. If we are forced to defend against infringement claims, we may face costly litigation, diversion of technical and management personnel, and product shipment delays, even if the allegations of infringement are unwarranted. If there is a successful claim of infringement against us and we are unable to develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis, or if we are required to cease using one or more of our business or product names due to a successful trademark infringement claim against us, it could adversely affect our business.\nOur intellectual property rights and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products.\nOur commercial success will depend substantially on our ability to obtain patents and other intellectual property rights and maintain adequate legal protection for our products in the United States and other countries. We will be able to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that these assets are covered by valid and enforceable patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights, or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. As of the date of this filing, we have 51 issued U.S. and foreign patents and 39 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. We apply for patents covering our products, services, technologies and designs, as we deem appropriate. We may fail to apply for patents on important products, services, technologies or designs in a timely fashion, or at all. We do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents. Even if patents are issued, they may not be sufficient to protect our products, services, technologies, or designs. Our existing and future patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from developing competing products, services technologies, or designs. Intellectual property protection and patent rights outside of the United States are even less predictable. As a result, the validity and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. Moreover, we cannot be certain whether:\n\u00b7 we were the first to conceive of or invent the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications;\n\u00b7 we were the first to reduce to practice inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications;\n\u00b7 we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u00b7 others will independently develop similar or alternative products, technologies, services or designs or duplicate any of our products, technologies, services or designs;\n\u00b7 any patents issued to us will provide us with any competitive advantages, or will be challenged by third parties;\n\u00b7 we will develop additional proprietary products, services, technologies or designs that are patentable; or\n\u00b7 the patents of others will have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe patents we own or license and those that may be issued to us in the future may be challenged, invalidated, rendered unenforceable or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages. Moreover, third parties could practice our inventions in territories where we do not have patent protection or in territories where they could obtain a compulsory license to our technology where patented. Such third parties may then try to import products made using our inventions into the United States or other territories. We cannot ensure that any of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents, or even if issued, predict the breadth, validity and enforceability of the claims upheld in our and other companies\u2019 patents.\nWe have registered and applied to register certain of our trademarks in several jurisdictions worldwide. In some jurisdictions where we have applied to register our trademarks, other applications or registrations exist for the same, similar or otherwise related products or services. If we are not successful in arguing that there is no likelihood of confusion between our marks and the marks that are the subject of the other applications or registrations owned by third parties, our applications may be denied, preventing us from obtaining trademark registrations and adequate protection for our marks in the relevant jurisdictions, which could impact our ability to build our brand identity and market our products and services in those jurisdictions. Whether or not our application is denied, third parties may claim that our trademarks infringe their rights. As a result, we could be forced to pay significant settlement costs or cease the use of these trademarks and associated elements of our brand in the United States or other jurisdictions.\nEven in those jurisdictions where we are able to register our trademarks, competitors may adopt or apply to register similar trademarks to ours, may register domain names that mimic ours or incorporate our trademarks, or may purchase keywords that are identical or confusingly similar to our brand names as terms in Internet search engine advertising programs, which could impede our ability to build our brand identity and lead to confusion among potential customers of our products and services. If we are not successful in proving that we have prior rights in our marks and arguing that there is a likelihood of confusion between our marks and the marks of these third parties, our inability to prevent these third parties from use may negatively impact the strength, value and effectiveness of our brand names and our ability to market our products and prevent consumer confusion.\nThe laws of certain countries do not protect intellectual property and proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our products, services, technologies and designs adequately against unauthorized third-party copying, infringement or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. To protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may initiate proceedings or litigation against third parties. Such proceedings or litigation may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or know-how, products, technologies, designs, brands, reputation, likeness, authorship works or other intellectual property rights. Such proceedings or litigation also may be necessary to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Any proceedings or lawsuits that we initiate could be expensive, take significant time and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Additionally, we may provoke third parties to assert claims against us. These claims could invalidate or narrow the scope of our own intellectual property rights. We may not prevail in any proceedings or lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may be commercially valuable. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we lose our rights under our third-party technology licenses, our operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business depends in part on technology rights licensed from third parties. We could lose our exclusivity or other rights to use the technology under our licenses if we fail to comply with the terms and performance requirements of the licenses. In addition, certain licensors may terminate a license upon our breach and have the right to consent to sublicense arrangements. If we were to lose our rights under any of these licenses, or if we were unable to obtain required consents to future sublicenses, we could lose a competitive advantage in the market, and may even lose the ability to commercialize certain products or technologies completely. Either of these results could substantially decrease our revenues.\nIf our customers are not satisfied with our technical support or software updates on some of our products, they may choose not to purchase our products, either of which would adversely impact our business and operating results.\nOur business relies, in part, on our customers\u2019 satisfaction with the technical support and software updates we provide to support our products. If we fail to provide technical support services that are responsive, satisfy our customers\u2019 expectations and resolve issues that they encounter with our products, customers may choose not to purchase additional products and we may face brand and reputational harm, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may be subject to product liability or warranty claims that could result in significant direct or indirect costs, or we could experience greater returns from our resellers than expected, which could harm our business and operating results.\nWe generally provide a one-year warranty on all of our consumer and enterprise products, except in the European Union, or EU, where we are required to provide a two-year warranty on all of our consumer products. The occurrence of any material defects in our products could make us liable for damages and warranty claims in excess of our current reserves. In addition, we could incur significant costs to correct any defects, warranty claims or other problems, including costs related to product recalls. Any negative publicity related to the perceived quality and safety of our products could affect our brand image, decrease retailer, distributor and customer demand, and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Also, while our warranty is limited to repairs and returns, warranty claims may result in litigation, the occurrence of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur dependence on sales to VARs, resellers, and distributors increases the risks of managing our supply chain and may result in excess inventory or inventory shortages.\nWe expect the majority of our various reseller relationships for our Video Eyewear and Smart Glasses products and their accessories could involve them taking inventory positions and reselling to multiple customers. Under some typical distributor relationships, we would not recognize revenue until the distributors sell the product through to their end user customers and receive payment thereon; however, at this time we do not currently enter into these types of arrangements. Our distributor and VAR relationships may reduce our ability to forecast sales and increase risks to our business. Since our distributors and VARs would act as intermediaries between us and the end user customers or resellers, we would be required to rely on our distributors to accurately report inventory levels and production forecasts. This may require us to manage a more complex supply chain and monitor the financial condition and credit worthiness of our distributors and VARs and their major end user customers. Our failure to manage one or more of these risks could result in excess inventory or shortages that could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.\nOur operating results may be adversely impacted by worldwide political and economic uncertainties and specific conditions in the markets we address.\nIn the recent past, the economies in the United States and elsewhere have experienced periods of slower economic activity, large and growing government debt levels and operating deficits, energy cost fluctuations, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, and adverse business conditions. Any worsening of the current global economic and financial conditions could materially adversely affect (i) our ability to raise, or the cost of, needed capital, and (ii) demand for our current and future products. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery, worldwide, or in the display industry.\nOur results of operations may suffer if we are not able to successfully manage our increasing exposure to foreign exchange rate risks.\nA substantial majority of our sales and cost of components are denominated in U.S. dollars. As our business grows, both our sales and production costs may increasingly be denominated in other currencies. Where such sales or production costs are denominated in other currencies, they are converted to U.S. dollars for the purpose of calculating any sales or costs to us. Our sales may decrease as a result of any appreciation of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies.\nThe majority of our current expenditures are incurred in U.S. dollars and many of our components come from countries that currently peg their currency against the U.S. dollar. If the pegged exchange rates should change adversely or be allowed to float up, additional U.S. dollars will be required to fund our purchases of these components.\nAlthough we do not currently enter into currency option contracts or engage in other hedging activities, we may do so in the future. There is no assurance that we will undertake any such hedging activities or that, if we do so, they will be successful in reducing the risks to us of our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\nDue to our significant level of international operations, including the use of foreign contract manufactures, we are subject to international operational, financial, legal and political risks which could harm our operating results.\nWe purchase product components from our suppliers, engage third party contract manufacturing firms to perform electronic circuit board and cable assemblies. While in the past we have performed the final assembly of our products ourselves in our Rochester, New York facility, and we did so for the start of our M100 Smart Glasses production, we recently began having it and our iWear Video Headphones assembled, in China. We expect to continue to have final assembly of most of our products performed externally: however, we intend to use our new West Henrietta, New York facility primarily for the production of waveguides and their related display engines. Some final assembly initial production runs of new products may also continue at our Henrietta plant. Accordingly, a substantial part of our operations, including manufacturing of certain components used in our products, are outside of the United States and many of our customers and suppliers have some or all of their operations in countries other than the United States. Risks associated with our doing business outside of the United States include:\n\u00b7 compliance burdens and costs with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, particularly labor, environmental and other laws and regulations that govern our operations in those countries;\n\u00b7 legal uncertainties regarding foreign taxes, tariffs, border taxes, quotas, export controls, export licenses, import controls and other trade barriers;\n\u00b7 economic instability and high levels of inflation in the countries of our suppliers and customers, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, causing delays or reductions in orders for their products and therefore our sales;\n\u00b7 political instability in the countries in which our suppliers operate, particularly in China, Korea and Taiwan;\n\u00b7 changes or volatility in currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7 difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer accounts receivable payment cycles; and\n\u00b7 potentially adverse tax consequences.\nAny of these factors could harm our own, our suppliers\u2019 and our customers\u2019 international operations and businesses and impair our and/or their ability to continue expanding into international markets.\nTerrorism and the uncertainty of future terrorist attacks or war could reduce consumer and business confidence which could adversely affect our operating results.\nTerrorist acts or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to our facilities, information systems, vendors, employees and customers, which could significantly harm our sales and results of operations. In the future, fears of war or additional acts of terrorism may have a negative effect on consumer confidence or consumer discretionary spending patterns, as well as have an adverse effect on the economy in general including enterprise customers. This impact may be particularly harmful to our business because we expect significant portions of our business to rely heavily on discretionary consumer spending and consumer confidence levels.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act or similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions in which we operate.\nThe global nature of our business and the significance of our international revenue create various domestic and local regulatory challenges and subject us to risks associated with our international operations. We operate in areas of the world that experience corruption by government officials to some degree and, in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery and anticorruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our global operations require us to import and export to and from several countries, which geographically expands our compliance obligations. In addition, changes in such laws could result in increased regulatory requirements and compliance costs which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (U.K. Bribery Act) and similar anti-bribery and anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit U.S.-based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to another, or securing an advantage. In addition, U.S. public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors, officers, employees, agents, or other strategic or local partners or representatives. As such, if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar legislation, governmental authorities in the United States and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions laws that could subject us to liability and impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nThe U.S. and various foreign governments have imposed controls, export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies. Our products are subject to U.S. export controls, including the Commerce Department\u2019s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, and exports of our products must be made in compliance with these laws. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the provision of products and services to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. Even though we take precautions to prevent our products from being provided to targets of U.S. sanctions, our products, including our firmware updates, could be provided to those targets or provided by our customers despite such precautions. Any such provision could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenue.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\u201d in this report. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation expense, software development costs, derivatives and fair value measurements, excess and obsolete inventory write-downs, warranty reserves, and long-lived assets.\nThe SEC is conducting an informal inquiry relating to us.\nOn May 24, 2016, we received a letter from the SEC, dated May 19, 2016, notifying us that the SEC is conducting an informal inquiry relating to us, and requesting that we produce certain documents relating to our internal control over financial reporting. We have produced the requested documents and thus far have not received requests for additional information. If, in connection with this informal inquiry, the SEC determines to take action against us, our financial position could be adversely affected.\nAny significant disruption to our ecommerce business could result in lost sales.\nOur sales through our ecommerce channel have been growing. Sales through vuzix.com and our related EU, UK and Japanese web stores generally have higher profit margins than sales through resellers and distributors. Online sales are subject to a number of risks. System interruptions or delays could cause potential customers to fail to purchase our products and could harm our brand. The operation of our direct to consumer ecommerce business through vuzix.com depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of online order-taking and fulfillment operations. Our ecommerce operations subject us to certain risks that could have an adverse effect on our operating results, including risks related to the computer systems that operate our website and related support systems, such as system failures, viruses, denial of services attacks, computer hackers and similar disruptions. If we are unable to continually add software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems, system interruptions or delays could occur that adversely affect our operating results.\nWe utilize third party vendors for our customer-facing ecommerce technology, portions of our order management system and fulfillment internationally. We depend on our technology vendors to manage \u201cup-time\u201d of the front-end ecommerce store, manage the intake of our orders, and export orders for fulfillment. Any failure on the part of our third party ecommerce vendors or in our ability to transition third party services effectively could result in lost sales and harm our business.\nFailure to adequately protect customer data could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace.\nChanging regulations and laws governing the Internet, data privacy, data protection and ecommerce transactions (including taxation, pricing and electronic communications) could impede the growth of our ecommerce business, increase our cost of doing business and limit our ability to collect and use information collected from our customers. Further, new regulations limiting our ability to collect, use and disclose customer data, or imposing additional requirements with respect to the retention and security of customer data, could limit our marketing activities and could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn connection with our ecommerce services, we process, store and transmit customer data. We also collect customer data through certain marketing activities. Failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches, including breaches of our vendors\u2019 technology and systems, could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information, adversely affect our operating results, result in litigation or potential liability for us and otherwise harm our business. Further, we are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, ecommerce and electronic devices and new interpretations of these laws, may adversely affect our ability to conduct our ecommerce business.\nWe may lose the services of key management personnel and may not be able to attract and retain other necessary personnel.\nChanges in our management could have an adverse effect on our business, is especially an issue while our staff is relatively small. We are dependent upon the active participation of several key management personnel, including Paul J. Travers, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Travers is critical to the strategic direction and overall management of our company as well as our research and development process. The loss of Mr. Travers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We do not carry key person life insurance on any of our senior management or other key personnel other than our CEO, but we do not believe the coverage would be sufficient to completely protect us against losses we may suffer if his services were to become unavailable to us in the future. Our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Grant Russell, a Canadian citizen, currently has his principal residence in Vancouver, Canada and a second residence in Rochester, New York. If he becomes unable to legally or efficiently travel to and work in the United States, his ability to perform some of his duties could be materially adversely affected.\nWe will need to hire and retain highly skilled technical personnel as employees and as independent contractors in order to develop our products. The competition for highly skilled technical, managerial and other personnel is at times intense. Our recruiting and retention success is substantially dependent on our ability to offer competitive salaries and benefits to our employees. We must compete with companies that possess greater financial and other resources than we do and that may be more attractive to potential employees and contractors. To be competitive, we may have to increase the compensation, bonuses, stock options and other fringe benefits offered to employees in order to attract and retain such personnel. The costs of retaining or attracting new personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. If we fail to attract and retain the technical and managerial personnel we need to be successful, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur failure to effectively manage growth could harm our business.\nWe intend to expand the number and types of products we sell. We will need to replace and regularly introduce on a timely basis new products and technologies, enhance existing products, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new products and upgraded versions of our existing products.\nThe replacement and expansion of our products places a significant strain on our management, operations and engineering resources. Specifically, the areas that are strained most by these activities include the following:\n\u00b7 New Product Launch: With the growth of our product portfolio, we will experience increased complexity in coordinating product development, manufacturing, and shipping. As this complexity increases, it places a strain on our ability to accurately coordinate the commercial launch of our products with adequate supply to meet anticipated customer demand and effectively market to stimulate demand and market acceptance. We have experienced delays in the past. If we are unable to scale and improve our product launch coordination, we could frustrate our customers and lose possible retail shelf space and product sales;\n\u00b7 Existing Products Impacted by New Introductions: The introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products, or replace sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction, and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products and potentially lead to challenges in managing inventory of existing products. We may also provide price protection to some of our retailers as a result of our new product introductions. If we fail to effectively manage new product introductions, our revenue and profitability may be harmed;\n\u00b7 Forecasting, Planning and Supply Chain Logistics: With the growth of our product portfolio, we will experience increased complexity in forecasting customer demand, in planning for production, and in transportation and logistics management. If we are unable to scale and improve our forecasting, planning, production, and logistics management, we could frustrate our customers, lose product sales or accumulate excess inventory.\nOur facilities and information systems and those of our key suppliers could be damaged as a result of disasters or unpredictable events, which could have an adverse effect on our business operations.\nWe operate the majority of our business from one location in the West Henrietta, a suburb of the Rochester, New York area. We also rely on third party manufacturing plants in Asia and third party logistics, sales and marketing facilities in Japan and England, and in other parts of the world to provide key components of our products and services necessary for our operations. If major disasters such as earthquakes, fires, floods, wars, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, transportation disasters or other events occur in any of these locations, or our information systems or communications network or those of any of our key component suppliers breaks down or operates improperly as a result of such events, our facilities or those of our key suppliers may be seriously damaged, and we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. We may also incur expenses relating to such damages. If production or shipment of our products or components is stopped or delayed or if we incur any increased expenses as a result of damage to our facilities, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Additionally such events could impair our ability to record, process and report accurate information to the SEC could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Manufacturing\nWe do not manufacture our own microdisplays, one of the key components of our Video Eyewear and Smart Glasses products, and we may not be able to obtain the microdisplays we need.\nWe do not currently own or operate any manufacturing facilities for microdisplays, one of the key components in our products. Certain other components and services necessary for the manufacture of our products are available from only a limited number of sources, and other components and services are only available from a single source. We currently purchase almost all of the microdisplays used in our Smart Glasses products from Kopin and the microdisplays used in our iWear Video Headphones from Omnivision. Our relationship with these companies generally is on a purchase order basis and neither firm has a contractual obligation to provide adequate supply or acceptable pricing to us on a long-term basis. Either firm could discontinue sourcing merchandise for us at any time. If one or both of these firms were to discontinue its relationships with us, or discontinue providing specific products to us, and we are unable to contract with a new supplier that can meet our requirements, or if they or such other supplier were to suffer a disruption in their production, we could experience disruption of our inventory flow, a decrease in sales and the possible need to redesign our products. Any such event could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Recently several new LCOS and alternative OLED suppliers have begun offering microdisplays suitable for use in our products. These manufacturers include Syndiant, Texas Instruments, HiMax, eMagin, Silicon Microdisplay, Sony, Omnivision, Citizen and others. With new tooling and electronics, any one of these alternative displays could be incorporated into our products but our costs of production could be higher, they may offer less performance, and make our products uneconomic.\nIf we lose access to components from a particular supplier, or experience a significant disruption in the supply of products and components from a current supplier, we may be unable to locate alternative suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all, and our business could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we experience a significant increase in demand for our products, our suppliers might not have the capacity or elect to meet our needs as they allocate components to other customers. Identifying a suitable supplier is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with the supplier\u2019s quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability and labor and other ethical practices, and if we seek to source materials from new suppliers there can be no assurance that we could do so in a manner that does not disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products. Our reliance on a single or limited number of suppliers involves a number of additional risks, including risks related to:\n\u00b7 supplier capacity constraints;\n\u00b7 price increases;\n\u00b7 timely delivery;\n\u00b7 component quality;\n\u00b7 failure of a key supplier to remain in business and adjust to market conditions;\n\u00b7 delays in, or the inability to execute on, a supplier roadmap for components and technologies; and\n\u00b7 natural disasters, fire, acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events.\nOur inability to obtain sufficient quantities of high quality components or services on a timely basis could result in future manufacturing delays, increased costs and ultimately in reduced or delayed sales or lost orders which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe do not control our contract manufacturers or suppliers, or require them to comply with a formal code of conduct, and actions that they might take could harm our reputation and sales.\nWe do not control our contract manufacturers or suppliers, including their labor, environmental or other practices, or require them to comply with a formal code of conduct. Though we conduct periodic visits to some of our contract manufacturers and suppliers, these visits are not so frequent or thorough enough to detect non-compliance with applicable laws and good industry practices. A violation of labor, environmental or other laws by our contract manufacturers or suppliers, or a failure of these parties to follow ethical business practices, could lead to negative publicity and harm our reputation. In addition, we may choose to seek alternative manufacturers or suppliers if these violations or failures were to occur. Identifying and qualifying new manufacturers or suppliers can be time consuming and we might not be able to substitute suitable alternatives in a timely manner or at an acceptable cost. Other consumer products companies have faced significant criticism for the actions of their manufacturers and suppliers, and we could face such criticism ourselves. Any of these events could adversely affect our brand, harm our reputation, reduce demand for our products and harm our ability to meet demand if we need to identify alternative manufacturers or suppliers.\nWe depend on third parties to provide integrated circuit chip sets and other critical components for use in our products.\nWe do not manufacture the integrated circuit chip sets, optics, microdisplays, backlights, printed circuit boards or other electronic components which are used in our products. Instead, we purchase them from third party suppliers or rely on third party independent contractors for these integrated circuit chip sets and other critical components, some of which are customized or specially made for us. We also may use third parties to assemble all or portions of our products. Some of these third party contractors and suppliers are small companies with limited financial resources. If any of these third party contractors or suppliers were unable or unwilling to supply these integrated circuit chip sets or other critical components to us, we would be unable to manufacture and sell our products until a replacement supplier could be found. We cannot assure investors that a replacement third party contractor or supplier could be found on reasonable terms or in a timely manner. Any interruption in our ability to manufacture and distribute our products could cause our display business to be unsuccessful and the value of investors\u2019 investment in us may decline.\nThe consumer electronics industry is subject to significant fluctuations in the availability of components. If we do not properly anticipate the need for critical components, we may be unable to meet the demands of our customers and end-users on a timely basis.\nThe availability of certain of the components that we require to produce our Video Eyewear and Smart Glasses products may decrease. As the availability of components decreases, the cost of acquiring those components ordinarily increases. High growth product categories such as the consumer electronics and mobile phone markets have experienced chronic shortages of components during periods of exceptionally high demand. If we do not properly anticipate the need for or procure critical components, we may pay higher prices for those components, our gross margins may decrease and we may be unable to meet the demands of our customers and end-users, which could reduce our competitiveness, cause a decline in our market share and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nUnanticipated disruptions in our operations or slowdowns by our suppliers, distributors and shipping companies could adversely affect our ability to deliver our products and service our customers.\nOur ability to provide high quality customer service, process and fulfill orders and manage inventory depends on the efficient, timely and uninterrupted performance of our manufacturing and distribution facilities and our management information systems and the facilities and systems of our third party suppliers, distributors and shipping companies.\nAny material disruption or slowdown in the operation of our manufacturing and distribution facilities or our management information systems, or comparable disruptions or slowdowns suffered by our principal suppliers, distributors or shippers could cause delays in our ability to receive, process and fulfill customer orders and may cause orders to be canceled, lost or delivered late, goods to be returned or receipt of goods to be refused. If any of these events occur, our sales and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nAdditional stock offerings in the future may dilute then existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership of our company.\nGiven our plans and expectations that we may need additional capital, we may need to issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible or exercisable for shares of common stock, including convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, stock options or warrants. The issuance of additional securities in the future will dilute the percentage ownership of then existing stockholders.\nThe rights of holders of common stock may be impaired by the possible future issuance of additional preferred stock.\nOur board of directors has the right, without approval of the holders of our common stock, to issue additional preferred stock with voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation and other rights which could adversely affect the voting power and equity interest of the holders of common stock, which could be issued with the right to more than one vote per share, and could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control. The possible negative impact on takeover attempts could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock other than the Series A Preferred Stock currently outstanding or to create any additional series of preferred stock, we may issue these shares in the future.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future on our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition, debt covenants in place, and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on a stockholders\u2019 investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates. In addition, the holder of our outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to certain dividends prior to payments of dividends to holders of common stock.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. Securities analysts have only recently commenced research coverage on us. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nOur issuance of common stock upon conversion of convertible notes or preferred stock or exercise of warrants or options may depress the price of our common stock.\nAs of March 16, 2017, we have issued and outstanding 19,675,960 shares of common stock, 49,626 shares of Series A Preferred Stock convertible into 4,962,600 shares of common stock, an aggregate of $1,569,517 in principal amount of convertible notes convertible into an aggregate of 697,563 shares of common stock, warrants to purchase 278,331 shares of common stock, and options to purchase 1,084,298 shares of common stock. The issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of convertible notes or preferred stock, or exercise of outstanding warrants or options could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders, which may have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.\nThe interests of the holder of our Series A Preferred Stock, which holds shares representing approximately 22% of the voting power of our stock and has the right to nominate and elect two directors, may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nOn January 2, 2015, we entered into and closed a Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we issued and sold to Intel Corporation (the \u201cSeries A Purchaser\u201d) 49,626 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into 100 shares of common stock and votes on an as-converted basis with the common stock. As of the date of this filing, the shares issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock represent approximately 22% of the total voting power of our outstanding stock. The Series A Purchaser may vote these shares with respect to any matter submitted to stockholders for a vote. In addition, the Series A Purchaser is entitled to nominate and elect two additional directors to the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard Election Right\u201d), one of whom is required to qualify as an \u201cindependent\u201d director, as that term is used in applicable exchange listing rules. The Series A Purchaser has not yet exercised the Board Election Right, but if it does so, the Series A Purchaser will have increased influence over matters considered by the Board of Directors. The Series A Purchaser may exercise its stockholder rights in a way that it believes is in its best interests, which may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. Pursuant to a letter we received from the Series A Purchaser on November 10, 2016, the Series A Purchaser stated, among other things, that for the time being they would continue to refrain from designating any directors to the Vuzix board and would not exercise its board observer rights and that the Company should not provide them with any board materials or correspondence.\nThe Series A Purchaser has notified us that it no longer desires to pursue a strategic relationship with us.\nThe shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock currently represent approximately 22% of our outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis. Resale of such conversion shares by the Series A Purchaser may depress the price of our common stock. On November 10, 2016, we received a letter from the Series A Purchaser stating that it had been evaluating its alternatives with respect to its significant investment in and strategic relationship with us and that it has concluded that it no longer desires to pursue a strategic relationship with us. While the Series A Purchaser stated it had high regard for the Company\u2019s team and its technology, the technology did not fit into its strategic plans. Furthermore, the Series A Purchaser added that it wanted to work with us to undertake an orderly disposition of its stock, subject to pricing and other conditions, that would minimize disruption in the markets, although it has not made any final decisions regarding its stock or the timing of a disposition. Resale of such conversion shares by the Series A Purchaser may depress the price of our common stock.\nOur stock price may be volatile in the future.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in results of operations, announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, general conditions in the wireless communications, semiconductor and display markets, changes in earnings estimates by analysts or other events or factors. In addition, the public stock markets recently have experienced extreme price and trading volatility. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 15186, "SIC": 3651, "TIC": "VUZI"}
