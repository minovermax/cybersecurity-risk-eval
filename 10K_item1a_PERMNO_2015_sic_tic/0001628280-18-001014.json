{"cik": "1635581", "company": "8point3 Energy Partners LP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nLimited partner interests are inherently different from the capital stock of a corporation, although many of the business risks to which we are subject are similar to those that would be faced by a corporation engaged in a similar business. If any of the following risks actually occur, they may materially harm our business and our financial condition and results of operations. In this event, we might not be able to pay distributions on our Class A Shares, and the trading price of our Class A Shares could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Merger with Capital Dynamics\nFailure to complete, or delays in completing, the Mergers with Capital Dynamics could negatively impact the market price of our Class A shares and our financial results.\nCompletion of the proposed Mergers with Capital Dynamics is subject to various conditions, including, among others, approval by our Class A shareholders, the absence of injunctions, the receipt of consents from third parties and governmental approvals including, but not limited to, CFIUS, FERC and HSR or other legal restrictions, and the truth and accuracy of representations and warranties, including those relating to the absence of any material adverse effect. There is no certainty that the various closing conditions will be satisfied and that the necessary approvals will be obtained. If these or other conditions are not satisfied or if there is a delay in the satisfaction of such conditions, then we may not be able to complete the Mergers timely or at all, and such failure or delay may have other adverse consequences. In addition, we and Capital Dynamics have the ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances.\nIf the Mergers are not completed or are delayed, we will be subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe market price of our Class A shares may decline to the extent that their current market price reflects a market assumption that the Mergers will be completed;\n\u2022\nsome costs relating to the Mergers, such as certain financial advisor and legal fees, must be paid even if the Mergers are not completed; and\n\u2022\nin specified circumstances, if the Mergers are not completed, we must pay Capital Dynamics either a termination fee of approximately $24 million or expense reimbursements up to $8 million, which may require us to borrow under our revolving credit facility.\nAdditionally, if the Mergers are not approved by our Class A shareholders or if the Mergers are not completed for any other reason, our Class A shareholders will not receive any payment for their Class A shares in connection with the Mergers. Instead, we will remain an independent public company, and the shares will continue to be traded on the NASDAQ. In addition, if the Mergers are not completed, we expect that management will have to reassess the Partnership\u2019s long-term strategy, such as considering refinancing debt and other liabilities and not increasing or even reducing quarterly distributions in order to achieve sustainable long-term distributions, and that our Class A shareholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including, without limitation, risks related to our business as further set forth herein.\nFurthermore, if the Mergers are not completed, the Board will continue to evaluate and review our business operations, properties and capitalization, among other things, make such changes as it deems appropriate and continue to seek to identify opportunities to enhance shareholder value. If the Mergers are not approved by our Class A shareholders or if the Mergers are not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to us will be offered or that our business, prospects or results of operation will not be adversely impacted. Additionally, if the Mergers are not completed, our Sponsors may continue to review their options regarding their continued ownership of us, which may include selling their interests, which could adversely impact our business, prospects or results of operations.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Mergers and related uncertainty could cause disruptions in our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results and the price of our Class A shares.\nDue to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the announcement of the Mergers could have an adverse effect on the price of our Class A shares. Additionally, we have important counterparties at every level of operations, including offtakers under our PPAs, lenders and tax equity investors. Uncertainty about the likelihood of completion and, the effect of the Mergers may negatively affect our relationship with our counterparties. These concerns may also cause our existing or potential new counterparties to be less likely to enter into new agreements or to demand more expensive or onerous terms, credit support, security or other conditions. Damage to our existing or potential future counterparty relationships may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the price of our Class A shares.\nUntil the Mergers with Capital Dynamics are completed or the Merger Agreement is terminated, we will not be able to pursue certain other alternatives to the Mergers because of restrictions in the Merger Agreement.\nUnless and until the Merger Agreement is terminated, subject to specified exceptions, we are restricted from soliciting, initiating or knowingly encouraging any inquiry, proposal or offer for an alternative transaction with any person. We may terminate the Merger Agreement and enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal only if specified conditions have been satisfied, including our compliance in all material respects with these non-solicitation provisions, and paying an approximately $24 million termination fee. These restrictions could affect the structure, pricing and other terms proposed by other parties seeking to enter into an alternative transaction with us and, as a result of these restrictions, we may not be able to enter into an agreement with respect to an alternative transaction on more favorable terms without incurring potentially significant liability to Capital Dynamics.\nWe will be subject to certain operating restrictions until completion of the Mergers.\nThe Merger Agreement generally restricts us, without Capital Dynamics\u2019s consent, from taking actions outside the ordinary course of business or from taking other specified actions until the Mergers occur or the Merger Agreement terminates. These restrictions may prevent us from taking actions that we might otherwise consider beneficial.\nWe may be subject to class action lawsuits relating to the Mergers, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results or prevent or delay completion of the Mergers.\nOur directors and officers may be subject to class action lawsuits relating to the Mergers, and other additional lawsuits that may be filed. Such litigation is common in connection with acquisitions of public companies, regardless of any merits related to the underlying acquisition. While we will evaluate and defend against any actions vigorously, the costs of the defense of such lawsuits and other effects of such litigation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, the attention of our management may be diverted to the Mergers and related lawsuits rather than our own operations and pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us.\nOne of the conditions to consummating the Mergers is that no injunction or other order prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation of the Mergers transactions shall have been issued by any court or governmental entity of competent jurisdiction in the United States. Consequently, if any lawsuit is filed challenging the Mergers and is successful in obtaining an injunction preventing the parties to the Merger Agreement from consummating the Mergers, such injunction may prevent the Mergers from being completed in the expected timeframe, or at all.\nFailure to complete, or significant delays in completing, the Mergers could negatively affect the trading prices of our Class A shares and our future business and financial results.\nThe transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are taxable and the resulting tax liability of any Class A shareholder, if any, will depend on each such Class A shareholder\u2019s particular situation.\nThe receipt of cash in exchange for our Class A shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement will be treated as a taxable sale by each holder of such Class A shares for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount of gain or loss recognized by each Class A shareholder will vary depending on each shareholder\u2019s particular situation, including the amount of cash received by such shareholder pursuant to the Merger Agreement and the adjusted tax basis of the Class A shares exchanged by each shareholder therefor.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur ability to make distributions to our Class A shareholders depends on the ability of OpCo to make cash distributions to its unitholders.\nOpCo may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to pay the minimum quarterly distribution or any amount to its unitholders and therefore we may not have sufficient available cash to pay any amount to our Class A shareholders.\nThe amount of cash that OpCo can distribute to its unitholders, including us, each quarter principally depends upon the amount of cash its subsidiaries generate from their operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe amount of revenue generated from the projects in which OpCo\u2019s subsidiaries have an interest;\n\u2022\nthe level of OpCo\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 O&M and SG&A costs;\n\u2022\nthe level of interest and principal amortization payments on any project-level indebtedness incurred by OpCo\u2019s subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nthe ability of OpCo to acquire additional projects;\n\u2022\nif OpCo acquires a project prior to its COD, timely completion of the project and the achievement of COD at expected capacity of the project; and\n\u2022\nexcept to the extent covered by a Sponsor pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement, indemnification obligations or diversions to tax equity investors of distributable cash from a project in order to compensate for breaches of representations, warranties or covenants; changes in allocation of ITCs, tax basis, fair market value or other tax-related matters; or delays in a distribution flip date beyond a specified date caused by a reduction of the corporate tax rate.\nIn addition, the amount of cash that OpCo will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, some of which are beyond its control, including:\n\u2022\navailability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility to pay distributions;\n\u2022\ndebt service requirements and other liabilities, including state or local taxes we may be required to pay;\n\u2022\nthe costs of acquisitions, if any;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in its working capital needs;\n\u2022\ntiming and collectability of receivables;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on distributions contained in existing or future debt agreements;\n\u2022\nprevailing economic conditions;\n\u2022\naccess to credit or capital markets; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash reserves established by the General Partner for the proper conduct of OpCo\u2019s business.\nPlease read the other risks set forth in \u201c-Risks Related to Our Business\u201d for a discussion of risks affecting OpCo\u2019s ability to generate cash available for distribution.\nThe amount of cash we have available for distribution to holders of our Class A shares depends primarily on our cash flow and not solely on profitability, which may prevent us from making cash distributions during periods when we record net income.\nThe amount of cash that OpCo has available for distribution depends primarily upon its cash flow, including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings, and is not solely a function of profitability, which is affected by non-cash items. As a result, even when OpCo records net losses in a period, it may be able to make cash distributions and may not be able to make cash distributions during periods when it records net income.\nThe seasonality of our operations may affect our liquidity.\nThe amount of electricity our solar power systems produce is dependent in part on the amount of sunlight, or irradiation, where the assets are located. Because shorter daylight hours in winter months result in less irradiation, the generation of particular assets will vary depending on the season. We expect our Portfolio\u2019s power generation to be at its lowest during the winter season of each year, thus, we expect our first quarter revenue generation to be lower than other quarters during our fiscal year.\nWe will need to maintain sufficient financial liquidity to absorb the impact of seasonal variations in energy production. We may need to reserve cash in other quarters or borrow under our revolving credit facility in order to pay distributions in quarters with shorter daylight hours.\nOur level of indebtedness or restrictions in OpCo\u2019s credit facility, or any future indebtedness of OpCo\u2019s subsidiaries, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nAs of November 30, 2017, we had outstanding borrowings of $300.0 million under the term loan facility, $250.0 million under the incremental term loan facility, $25.0 million under the delayed draw term loan facility and $70.0 million under the revolving credit facility, as well as approximately $54.6 million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The remaining portion of the revolving credit facility, or approximately $75.4 million, was undrawn as of November 30, 2017. In the future, we may significantly increase our debt to fund our operations or future acquisitions. We may also enter into project-level financing arrangements for our existing projects or in connection with future acquisitions.\nOpCo\u2019s credit facility matures in June 2020. We do not have available cash or short-term liquid investments sufficient to repay all of this medium-term debt and we have not obtained commitments for refinancing this debt. Therefore, we may not be able to extend the maturity of this debt or to otherwise successfully refinance current maturities if the corporate finance markets deteriorate substantially. Refinancing such indebtedness may force us to accept then-prevailing market terms that are less favorable than our existing debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders. In addition, in the future, we may significantly increase our debt to fund our operations or future acquisitions. We may also enter into project-level financing arrangements for our existing projects or in connection with future acquisitions. Moreover, in specified circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, we must pay Capital Dynamics either a termination fee of approximately $24 million or up to $8 million in expense reimbursements, which may require us to borrow under our revolving credit facility.\nOpCo\u2019s credit facility contains various covenants and restrictive provisions that limit OpCo\u2019s ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022\nmake distributions on or redeem or repurchase OpCo common units;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nincur certain liens or permit them to exist;\n\u2022\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with another company; and\n\u2022\ntransfer, sell or otherwise dispose of projects.\nAny future project-level financing arrangements may contain similar covenants and restrictive provisions.\nIn addition, OpCo\u2019s debt and any future project level debt could have important negative consequences on our financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nrestricting the ability of OpCo\u2019s subsidiaries to make certain distributions to OpCo, OpCo\u2019s ability to make certain distributions to us and our ability to make certain distributions with respect to our Class A shares in light of restricted payment and other financial covenants in OpCo\u2019s credit facility;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of OpCo\u2019s cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, therefore reducing its ability to pay distributions to us and our ability to pay distributions to our Class A shareholders or to use OpCo\u2019s cash flow to fund operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to enter into long-term offtake agreements because such offtake agreements require credit support which may not be permitted under our financing arrangements;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to enter into power interconnection agreements, which typically require credit support, which may not be permitted under our financing arrangements, for the construction of interconnection facilities and network upgrades to the transmission grid;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to fund operations or future acquisitions;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of OpCo\u2019s borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, including collateral postings, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt.\nOpCo\u2019s credit facility also contains covenants requiring OpCo to maintain certain financial ratios, including as a condition to making cash distributions to us and its other unitholders. OpCo\u2019s ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and it may be unable to meet those ratios and tests and therefore may be unable to make cash distributions to its unitholders including us. As a result, we may be unable to make distributions to our Class A shareholders. In addition, the credit facility contains events of default customary for transactions of this nature, including the occurrence of a change of control.\nThe provisions of the credit facility may affect our ability to pursue attractive business opportunities and our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. A failure to comply with the provisions of the credit facility could result in an event of default, which could enable the lenders to declare, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable credit facility, any outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable and entitle lenders to enforce their security interest. If the payment of the debt is accelerated, the revenue from the projects may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, lenders could enforce their security interest and our Class A shareholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investment.\nIn addition, a high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance. General economic conditions, commodity prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the interest on our debt and future working capital, borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our Class A shares or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions, the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital.\nOur ability to effectively consummate future acquisitions will also depend on our ability to arrange the required or desired financing for acquisitions.\nOpCo distributes a substantial amount of its available cash to its unitholders, including us, and will rely primarily upon its cash reserves and external financing sources, including borrowings under its revolving credit facility and the issuance of debt and equity securities, including by us, as well as tax equity financing, to fund future acquisitions.\nOpCo may not have sufficient availability under its credit facilities or have access to project-level financing on commercially reasonable terms when acquisition opportunities arise. In addition, our and its ability to access the capital markets is dependent on, among other factors, the overall state of the capital markets and investor appetite for investment in clean energy projects, cash generating vehicles similar to us in general, and our Class A shares in particular and may be limited by our and its financial condition at such time as well as the covenants in our debt agreements, general economic conditions and contingencies or other uncertainties that are beyond our control. An inability to obtain the required or desired financing, or any terms of such financing that makes an acquisition economically undesirable, could significantly limit our ability to consummate future acquisitions. If financing is available, it may be available only on terms that could significantly increase our interest expense, impose additional or more restrictive covenants and reduce cash available for distribution. Furthermore, under the terms of the Stateline Promissory Note, we are generally required to use the proceeds of sales of our Class A shares to pre-pay amounts outstanding under the Stateline Promissory Note until it is paid in full. As a result, the proceeds from such a sale will not be used to consummate future acquisitions until the Stateline Promissory Note is paid in full.\nDue to our higher cost of capital and inability to access the capital markets on a consistent basis, commencing in fiscal 2016, we and our Sponsors agreed to make several adjustments to the projects subject to the ROFO Agreements, replacing interests in certain projects with alternatives. Later, when certain projects were ultimately offered to us under the ROFO Agreement, we were unable to transact due to these same fiscal constraints. The offered projects were subsequently acquired by third party buyers at purchase prices higher than those offered to us. As a result of such adjustments, we no longer have a right of first offer on any projects developed by First Solar. Such challenges present certain strategic and financial implications on our operations, including, but not limited to, difficulty maintaining a sustainable, long-term distribution growth strategy, potential refinancing of our capital structure in order to acquire additional projects, and our prospects as a stand-alone public company without the Sponsors and our resulting competitive position in the market for renewable energy assets. In addition, due to the limitations on our ability to acquire projects under the Merger Agreement, we agreed to enter into the Waiver Agreement with SunPower which waives our right of first offer on all the projects subject to the SunPower ROFO Agreement during the pendency of the Merger Agreement.\nTo the extent we are unable to finance acquisitions with external sources of capital, the requirement in OpCo\u2019s limited liability company agreement to distribute all of its available cash and our current cash distribution policy will significantly impair our ability to grow. In addition, because we will distribute all of our available cash, we may not be able to make acquisitions that businesses that reinvest all of their available cash to expand ongoing operations may be able to make.\nTo the extent we issue additional shares, the payment of distributions on those additional shares may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our cash distributions per share. There are no limitations in our Partnership Agreement on our ability to issue additional shares, including shares ranking senior to our Class A shares, and our shareholders (other than our Sponsors and their affiliates) will have no preemptive or other rights (solely as a result of their status as shareholders) to purchase any such additional shares. If we incur additional debt (under our revolving credit facility or otherwise) to finance acquisitions, we will have increased interest expense, which in turn will reduce the available cash that we have to distribute to our Class A shareholders.\nOpCo is not permitted to acquire interests in projects until we pay in full the principal of and interest on the Stateline Promissory Note.\nOn December 1, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of the Stateline Project, OpCo issued the Stateline Promissory Note to a subsidiary of First Solar in the principal amount of $50.0 million. The Stateline Promissory Note is unsecured and matures on the date that is six months after the maturity date under OpCo\u2019s credit facility. Interest will accrue at a rate of 4.00% per annum, except it will accrue at a rate of 6.00% per annum (i) upon the occurrence and during the continuation of a specified event of default and (ii) in respect of amounts accrued as payments-in-kind pursuant to the terms of the Stateline Promissory Note.\nUntil OpCo has paid in full the principal and interest on the Stateline Promissory Note, OpCo is restricted in its ability to:\n\u2022\nacquire interests in additional projects;\n\u2022\nuse the net proceeds of equity issuances except as prescribed in the Stateline Promissory Note;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness to which the Stateline Promissory Note would be subordinate; and\n\u2022\nextend the maturity date under OpCo\u2019s credit facility.\nAny of the above restrictions could substantially affect our ability to grow our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nOur inability to acquire additional solar energy projects due to our Sponsors\u2019 decision to keep projects that they develop, competing bids for a solar energy project, our inability to agree on terms with the developer of a solar energy project, including our Sponsors, or our inability to arrange the required or desired financing for such acquisitions could have a significant effect on our ability to grow.\nOur acquisition strategy is based on our expectation of ongoing divestitures of solar energy projects by project developers, including our Sponsors. Though the SunPower ROFO Agreement provides us with a right of first offer until June 24, 2020 with respect to certain projects that SunPower is developing should it choose to sell such projects, there is no guarantee that SunPower will make available to us any projects before our right of first offer expires or at all. In addition, due\nto the limitations on our ability to acquire projects under the Merger Agreement, in connection with the Conflicts Committee\u2019s and the Board\u2019s approval of the Merger Agreement, we agreed to enter into the Waiver Agreement with SunPower which waives our right of first offer on all the projects subject to the SunPower ROFO Agreement during the pendency of the Merger Agreement. In the event that the Merger Agreement terminates without the closing of the Mergers, the waiver would terminate with respect to all projects subject to the SunPower ROFO Agreement, except, with respect to individual projects still owned by SunPower at the termination of such waiver, the projects that are either under a binding, written exclusivity agreement with a third party or have an offer for purchase from a third party pursuant to which SunPower is in negotiations.\nIn addition, our Sponsors have developed, and may continue to develop in the future, many solar energy projects that are not subject to the SunPower ROFO Agreement. Our Sponsors may freely sell such projects to third parties without any obligation to us. Furthermore, even if we have the opportunity to make a first offer on projects that our Sponsors seek to sell or to acquire projects from a third party, we may choose not to pursue such opportunity, be unable to negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with them for such projects, be unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, be outbid by competitors including our Sponsors or cash generating vehicles similar to us or be unable to obtain necessary governmental or third-party consent. We are also restricted, under the terms of the Stateline Promissory Note, from acquiring interests in projects until we pay in full the principal of and interest on the Stateline Promissory Note. Additionally, our Sponsors are under no obligation to accept any offer made by us with respect to such opportunities and upon a failure to agree to such offer are subject to few restrictions when selling to a third party. Third party purchasers may have lower costs of capital than us, and our Sponsors may be able to sell projects to such third parties on more favorable terms than we would be able or willing to accept. Furthermore, for a variety of reasons, we may decide not to exercise these rights when they become available, and our decision will not be subject to shareholder approval. As such, there is no guarantee that we will be able to make any such offer or consummate any acquisition of solar energy projects from our Sponsors or others.\nAt or prior to COD of the projects subject to the SunPower ROFO Agreement, SunPower may enter into arrangements, often referred to as tax equity financing, with investors seeking to utilize the tax attributes of their projects which may result in a reduction of our expected economic ownership of such SunPower ROFO Project. These arrangements have multiple potential structures which have differing impacts on our economic ownership and may be on terms less favorable than those currently in place at certain of our existing projects.\nWe may not be able to make acquisitions of additional solar energy projects that are accretive or of the best economic interest to us.\nOur ability to expand our business operations and increase our quarterly cash distributions depends on pursuing opportunities to acquire contracted solar energy projects from our Sponsors and others. The evolving nature of the solar industry has enabled the Sponsors\u2019 strategies of recycling capital faster and more efficiently by selling projects at a stage of construction and development, which is earlier than best suited for us. Due to our higher cost of capital and inability to access the capital markets on a consistent basis, commencing in fiscal 2016, we and our Sponsors agreed to make several adjustments to the projects subject to the ROFO Agreements, replacing interests in certain projects with alternatives. Later, when certain projects were ultimately offered to us under the ROFO Agreement, we were unable to transact due to these same fiscal constraints. The offered projects were subsequently acquired by third party buyers at purchase prices higher than those offered to us. As a result of such adjustments, we no longer have a right of first offer on any projects developed by First Solar. In addition, until the Stateline Promissory Note is repaid in full, our ability to acquire new projects is restricted. Such challenges present certain strategic and financial implications on our operations, including, but not limited to, difficulty maintaining a sustainable, long-term distribution growth strategy, potential refinancing of our capital structure in order to acquire additional projects, and our prospects as a stand-alone public company without the Sponsors and our resulting competitive position in the market for renewable energy assets. In addition, due to the limitations on our ability to acquire projects under the Merger Agreement, we agreed to enter into the Waiver Agreement with SunPower which waives our right of first offer on all the projects subject to the SunPower ROFO Agreement during the pendency of the Merger Agreement.\nVarious factors, described in more detail in succeeding risk factors, could affect the availability, ability to acquire or performance of such solar energy projects we seek to acquire to grow our business, including the following factors, which are described in more detail in the additional risk factors herein:\n\u2022\nour inability to consummate an acquisition of a SunPower ROFO Project or other solar energy project due to the Waiver Agreement;\n\u2022\nour inability to acquire interests in projects until we pay in full the principal of and interest on the Stateline Promissory Note; or\n\u2022\nperformance of the acquired assets at a level below expectations.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could substantially affect our ability to grow our business which would correspondingly have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nSunPower\u2019s failure to complete the development of the SunPower ROFO Projects or project developers\u2019, including our Sponsors\u2019, failure to develop other solar energy projects, including those opportunities that are part of our Sponsors\u2019 development pipeline, could have a significant effect on our ability to grow.\nSunPower could decide not to develop or to discontinue development of the SunPower ROFO Projects and project developers, including our Sponsors, could decide not to develop additional solar energy projects, including those opportunities included in our Sponsors\u2019 development pipeline, for a variety of reasons, including, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nissues related to pricing and terms under offtake agreements;\n\u2022\nissues related to project siting, including permits, environmental regulations and governmental approvals, and the negotiation of project development agreements;\n\u2022\ndifficulty accessing the capital markets to secure construction financing;\n\u2022\nsustained pressure on pricing for the solar modules sold by our Sponsors, which may adversely affect our Sponsors\u2019 cash flows and ability to develop solar energy projects;\n\u2022\nissues with solar energy technology being unsuitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return;\n\u2022\ndemand for solar power systems failing to develop sufficiently or taking longer than expected to develop, including as a result of the extension of the ITC;\n\u2022\na reduction in government incentives or adverse changes in policy and laws for the development or use of solar energy;\n\u2022\nissues related to the imposition of safeguard tariffs on crystalline silicon photovoltaic products (\"CSPV\") pursuant to Proclamation 9693 of January 23, 2018, \u201cTo Facilitate Positive Adjustment to Competition From Imports of Certain Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells (Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products) and for Other Purposes,\u201d including market volatility, price fluctuations, supply shortages, and project delays in the near term and materially increasing the price of solar products in the long term;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other alternative energy technologies or conventional energy companies;\n\u2022\nhigh development or capital costs; and\n\u2022\na material reduction in the retail or wholesale price and availability of traditional utility generated electricity or electricity from other sources.\nDue to our higher cost of capital and inability to access the capital markets on a consistent basis, commencing in fiscal 2016, we and our Sponsors agreed to make several adjustments to the projects subject to the ROFO Agreements, replacing interests in certain projects with alternatives. Later, when certain projects were ultimately offered to us under the ROFO Agreement, we were unable to transact due to these same fiscal constraints. The offered projects were subsequently acquired by third party buyers at purchase prices higher than those offered to us. As a result of such adjustments, we no longer have a right of first offer on any projects developed by First Solar. In addition, until the Stateline Promissory Note is repaid in full, our ability to acquire new projects is restricted. Such challenges present certain strategic and financial implications on our operations, including, but not limited to, difficulty maintaining a sustainable, long-term distribution growth strategy, potential refinancing of our capital structure in order to acquire additional projects, and our prospects as a stand-alone public company without the Sponsors and our resulting competitive position in the market for renewable energy assets. In addition, due to the limitations on our ability to acquire projects under the Merger Agreement, we agreed to enter into the Waiver Agreement with SunPower which waives our right of first offer on all the projects subject to the SunPower ROFO Agreement during the pendency of the Merger Agreement.\nBoth of our Sponsors also announced significant work force reductions in the second half of 2016. If the challenges of developing solar energy projects increase for project developers, including our Sponsors, our pool of available opportunities may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nEven if we consummate acquisitions that we believe will be accretive to cash available for distribution per Class A share, those acquisitions may decrease the cash available for distribution per Class A share as a result of incorrect assumptions in our evaluation of such acquisitions, unforeseen consequences or other external events beyond our control.\nThe acquisition of existing solar energy projects involves the risk of overpaying for such projects (or not making acquisitions on an accretive basis) and failing to retain the customers of such projects. In addition, upon consummation of an acquisition, such acquisition will be subject to many of the risks set forth above in \u201c-Risks Related to Our Business.\u201d While we will perform due diligence on prospective acquisitions, we may not discover all potential risks, operational issues or other issues in such solar energy projects. In addition, in determining to acquire attractively priced operating solar power systems, the General Partner may be influenced by factors that could result in a misalignment or conflict of interest. Further, the integration and consolidation of acquisitions require substantial human, financial and other resources and, ultimately, our acquisitions may divert our management\u2019s attention from our existing business concerns, disrupt our ongoing business or not be successfully integrated. Future acquisitions might not perform as expected or the returns from such acquisitions might not support the financing utilized to acquire them or maintain them. A failure to achieve the financial returns we expect when we acquire solar energy projects could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders. Any failure of our acquired solar energy projects to be accretive or difficulty in integrating such acquisition into our business could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nWe have a limited operating history and our projects may not perform as we expect.\nThe majority of projects in our Portfolio are relatively new. As of November 30, 2017, our Portfolio consisted of interests in 946 MW of solar energy projects located entirely in the United States, all of which are operational. As of November 30, 2017, we owned interests in ten utility-scale solar energy projects representing 92% of the generating capacity of our Portfolio, and four C&I solar energy projects and a portfolio of residential DG Solar assets representing 8% of the generating capacity of our Portfolio. In addition, all of our Residential Portfolio attained COD within the last five years. As a result, our assumptions and estimates regarding the performance of these projects are and will be made without the benefit of a meaningful operating history, which may impair our ability to accurately estimate our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The ability of our projects to perform as we expect will also be subject to risks inherent in newly constructed solar energy projects, including equipment and system performance below our expectations or equipment and system failures and outages. The failure of some or all of our projects to perform according to our expectations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nEnergy projects involve significant risks that could result in a business interruption or partial or complete shutdown for which we may not be adequately insured.\nThere are risks associated with the ownership and operation of our projects. These risks include:\n\u2022\nbreakdown or failure of solar modules, inverters, transformers and other equipment that are not covered by warranty or insurance;\n\u2022\ncatastrophic events, such as fires, earthquakes, severe weather, tornadoes, ice or hail storms or other meteorological conditions, landslides, effects of climate change and other similar events beyond our control, which could severely damage or destroy a project, reduce its energy output or result in personal injury, loss of life or property damage;\n\u2022\ntechnical performance below expected levels, including the failure of solar modules and other equipment to produce energy as expected due to incorrect measures of performance provided by equipment suppliers;\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of operating the projects, including costs relating to labor, equipment, insurance, permit compliance and taxes;\n\u2022\noperator, contractor or equipment provider error or failure to perform;\n\u2022\nserial design or manufacturing defects, which may not be covered by warranty or insurance;\n\u2022\ncertain unremediated events under project contracts that may give rise to a termination right of the contract counterparty;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with permits and the inability to renew or replace permits that have expired or terminated;\n\u2022\nthe inability to operate within limitations that may be imposed by current or future governmental permits or project contracts;\n\u2022\nreplacements for failed equipment, which may need to meet new interconnection standards or require system impact studies and compliance that may be difficult or expensive to achieve;\n\u2022\nland use, environmental or other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndisputes with owners of land on which our projects are located or adjacent landowners;\n\u2022\nchanges in law, including changes in governmental permit requirements;\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, theft, vandalism and other intentionally harmful acts;\n\u2022\ngovernment or utility exercise of eminent domain power or similar events; and\n\u2022\nexistence of superior interests, liens, encumbrances and other imperfections in title affecting ownership and use of real estate interests.\nAny of the risks described above could significantly decrease or eliminate the revenues of a project, significantly increase its operating costs, cause OpCo or its subsidiaries to default under OpCo\u2019s credit facility or other financing agreements or give rise to damages or penalties owed by us to a contractual counterparty, a governmental authority or other third parties or cause defaults under related contracts or permits. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nWe rely on a limited number of offtake counterparties and we are exposed to the risk that they are unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to us or that they otherwise terminate their offtake agreements with us.\nIn most instances, we sell the energy generated by each of our utility and C&I scale projects to a single counterparty under a long-term offtake agreement. These offtake agreements are the primary source of cash flows for these projects. Thus, the actions of even one offtake counterparty may cause material variability of our overall revenue, profitability and cash flows that are difficult to predict. Our counterparties may face liquidity and credit issues that could impair their ability to meet their payment obligations under such offtake agreements or cause them to renegotiate such offtake agreements at lower rates or for shorter terms. These conditions may lead some of our customers, particularly customers that are facing financial difficulties, to seek to renegotiate such offtake agreements on terms that are less attractive to us.\nFor example, FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. (\u201cFirstEnergy\u201d), our offtake counterparty with respect to the Maryland Solar Project, had its credit rating downgraded multiple times in 2016 and 2017. As of January 31, 2018, the credit rating of FirstEnergy was Ca and CCC- by Moody\u2019s Investors Service and Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services, respectively, both of which are below investment grade. In addition, Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services placed FirstEnergy on CreditWatch with negative implications, based on a significant impairment charge that the company\u2019s competitive business will incur from the deactivation of several coal units. In November 2016, FirstEnergy Corp., the parent of FirstEnergy, announced a strategic review of its competitive business, pursuant to which the company would seek to move away from competitive markets. In addition, Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services also placed another of our offtake counterparties, Macy\u2019s, on CreditWatch in January 2016 and on CreditWatch negative in January 2017. FirstEnergy\u2019s annual report on their Form 10-K for their 2016 fiscal year reported a substantial uncertainty as to their ability to continue as a going concern. Both First Energy and Macy\u2019s remain on Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services under CreditWatch.\nAs further described in Part III, Item 13. \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Agreements with our Sponsors-Maryland Solar Lease Arrangement,\u201d the Maryland Solar Project Entity has leased the Maryland Solar Project to an affiliate of First Solar, with the lease term expiring on December 31, 2019. Under the arrangement, First Solar\u2019s affiliate is obligated to pay a fixed amount of rent that is set based on the expected operations of the plant. Such lease agreement will terminate upon any termination of the PPA for the Maryland Solar Project or the site ground lease. Pursuant to the PPA for the Maryland Solar Project, a FirstEnergy bankruptcy would be an event of default under the PPA, permitting (subject to applicable law) the termination of the PPA, although FirstEnergy may choose to renegotiate or maintain the PPA in its current form. Upon any such early termination of the lease agreement, First Solar\u2019s affiliate is obligated to return the facility in its then-current condition and location to us, without any warranties, and no rent shall thereafter be payable by such First Solar affiliate. In the event that the PPA was terminated, the Maryland Solar Project would have no agreement through which to sell the energy that it produces, which equates to approximately $8.0 million in annual revenue. We would attempt to replace the PPA with a similar offtake agreement; however, we may not be able to find a replacement offtake agreement in a timely manner or at all and the terms of any replacement agreement may be less favorable to us than the terminated PPA.\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets, including property and equipment and projects, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. In consideration of the above events, we evaluated whether the carrying value of the project may no longer be recoverable using a probability-weighted assessment of potential outcomes and related undiscounted cash flows. As a result of such evaluation, we concluded the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the project over its estimated useful life exceeded the $51.5 million carrying value of the Maryland Solar Project's property and equipment as of November 30, 2017. Such assessment is subject to significant uncertainty and could change significantly as facts and circumstances change. In the event that the PPA for the Maryland Solar Project was terminated, if we are unable to enter into a replacement agreement or sell the energy it produces under similar terms, the carrying value of the project may not be recoverable, and we would record a material impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value.\nWhile as of November 30, 2017, both FirstEnergy and Macy\u2019s are current with respect to payments due under the PPAs for the Maryland Solar Project, the Macy\u2019s California Project and the Macy\u2019s Maryland Project, as applicable, a failure by such offtake counterparties to fulfill their obligations under their respective PPAs, or any restructuring of their obligations pursuant to bankruptcy or similar proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nSimilarly, significant portions of our credit risk may be concentrated among a limited number of offtake counterparties and the failure of even one of these key offtake counterparties to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our business and financial results. Our largest offtake counterparties are Southern California Edison and SDG&E. Our customers in our residential projects lease solar power systems from us under long-term lease agreements. The lease terms are typically for 20 years, and require the customer to make monthly payments to us. Accordingly, we are subject to the credit risk of our customers. The average FICO score of our residential customers was approximately 765 at the time of initial contract. The risk of customer defaults may increase if we grow our portfolio of residential projects. Any or all of our offtake counterparties may fail to fulfill their obligations under their offtake agreements with us, whether as a result of the occurrence of any of the following factors or otherwise:\n\u2022\nspecified events beyond our control or the control of an offtake counterparty may temporarily or permanently excuse the offtake counterparty from its obligation to accept and pay for delivery of energy generated by a utility project. These events could include a system emergency, transmission failure or curtailment, adverse weather conditions or labor disputes;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our offtake counterparties to fulfill their contractual obligations to us depends on their creditworthiness. We are exposed to the credit risk of our offtake counterparties over an extended period of time due to the long-term nature of our offtake agreements with them. These customers could become subject to insolvency or liquidation proceedings or otherwise suffer a deterioration of their creditworthiness when they have not yet paid for energy delivered, any of which could result in underpayment or nonpayment under such agreements; and\n\u2022\na default or failure by us to satisfy minimum energy delivery requirements or in mechanical availability levels under our offtake agreements could result in damage payments to the offtake counterparty or termination of the applicable offtake agreement.\nIf our offtake counterparties are unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, or if they otherwise terminate such offtake agreements prior to their expiration, we may not be able to recover contractual payments and commitments due to us. Since the number of utility and C&I customers is limited, we may be unable to find a new energy purchaser on similar or favorable terms or at all. In some cases, there currently is no economical alternative counterparty to the original offtake counterparty. The loss of or a reduction in sales to any of our offtake counterparties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nWe depend on certain projects for a substantial portion of our anticipated cash flows.\nWe depend on certain projects for a substantial portion of our anticipated cash flows. We may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy in order to further diversify our sources of cash flow and reduce our portfolio concentration. Consequently, the impairment or loss of any one or more of our large utility-scale solar energy projects, such as the Henrietta Project, the Quinto Project, the Solar Gen 2 Project or the Stateline Project, would materially and disproportionately reduce our total energy generation and cash flows and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nOur business is concentrated in certain markets, putting us at risk of region specific disruptions.\nOf the 946 MW in our Portfolio as of November 30, 2017, approximately 855 MW is located in California, including approximately 799 MW of our utility projects and 56 MW of our DG Solar projects, further concentrating our customer base and operational infrastructure. Accordingly, our business and results of operations are particularly susceptible to adverse economic, regulatory, political, weather and other conditions in this market and in other markets where we become similarly concentrated. Any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders. In addition, all our assets are located in the United States, which makes us particularly susceptible to adverse changes in U.S. tax and environmental laws. Please read \u201c-Government regulations providing incentives and subsidies for solar energy could change at any time, including pursuant to the proposed environmental and tax policies of the current administration\u201d and \u201c-Risks Related to Taxation-Our future tax liability may be greater than expected if we do not generate NOLs sufficient to offset taxable income or if tax authorities challenge certain of our tax positions.\u201d\nA subsidiary of Southern Company controls certain of the entities that own our largest projects, and we may acquire projects in the future that neither we nor our Sponsors control.\nA subsidiary of Southern Company owns a 51% economic interest in, and we own a 49% economic interest in, each of the Henrietta Project Entity, the Lost Hills Blackwell Project Entity, the North Star Project Entity and the Solar Gen 2 Project Entity. In addition, a subsidiary of Southern Company owns a 66% economic interest in, and we own a 34% economic interest in the Stateline Project Entity. Collectively, these five project entities in which we own minority interests constitute over 68% of the MW of the projects in our portfolio of solar assets as of November 30, 2017.\nWe do not control the governing boards of these project entities and, as the minority interest holder, we have limited approval rights with respect to such project entities. As a result, we have limited influence over these project entities and limited flexibility to control the operation of or cash distributions received from these entities. Specifically,\n\u2022\nwe may have limited ability to control decisions with respect to the operations of these entities and their subsidiaries, including decisions with respect to incurrence of expenses and distributions to us and to project contract compliance and enforcement of counterparty obligations under such project contracts;\n\u2022\nthese entities may establish reserves for working capital, capital projects, environmental matters and legal proceedings which would otherwise reduce cash available for distribution to us;\n\u2022\nthese entities may incur additional indebtedness, and principal and interest made on such indebtedness may reduce cash otherwise available for distribution to us;\n\u2022\nthe terms of indebtedness of these entities may limit their ability to distribute cash to us; and\n\u2022\nthese entities may require us to make additional capital contributions to fund working capital and capital expenditures, our funding of which could reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution.\nIn addition to the other risks inherent in these projects, we are subject to the credit risk of Southern Company. If Southern Company were to fail to perform its obligations adequately, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nIn the case of the Henrietta Project Entity, the Lost Hills Blackwell Project Entity, the North Star Project Entity, the Solar Gen 2 Project Entity and the Stateline Project Entity, cash distributions are made on a quarterly basis to the extent cash is available after payment of third-party expenses, member loans, indemnification obligations and reserves. Reserves are based on the amount of reserves in the annual approved budget, permitted agreements approved after the approval of the annual budget, reserves required by any indebtedness of the entity and working capital reserves not to exceed the amount of permitted budget variances. Subject to certain exceptions, the cash distribution amount is allocated (i) 51% to a subsidiary of Southern Company and 49% to OpCo with respect to the Henrietta Project Entity, the Lost Hills Blackwell Project Entity, the North Star Project Entity and the Solar Gen 2 Project Entity and (ii) 66% to a subsidiary of Southern Company and 34% to OpCo with respect to the Stateline Project Entity.\nFurther, additional solar energy projects we may acquire may be subject to a similar structure where we do not own a majority of the project entity and we may invest in joint ventures in which we share control or in which we are a minority investor. In these instances, the majority investor or controlling investor may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources management and other attributes necessary to operate these assets optimally.\nAny of these items could significantly and adversely impact our ability to distribute cash to our Class A shareholders. For a more complete description of the agreements governing the management and operation of the entities in our Portfolio in which we own an interest, please read Part III, Item 13. \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\u201d\nGovernment regulations providing incentives and subsidies for solar energy could change at any time, including pursuant to the proposed environmental and tax policies of the current administration, and such changes may negatively impact our business.\nOur ability to acquire solar energy projects partly depends on current government policies that promote and support solar energy and enhance the economic viability of owning solar energy projects. Solar energy projects currently benefit from various U.S. federal, state and local governmental incentives, such as ITCs, loan guarantees, RPS programs or the Modified Accelerated Cost-Recovery System for depreciation and other incentives. These policies have had a significant impact on the development of solar energy and they could change at any time, especially in the event that the current administration were to embark on a significant change in federal energy policy. These incentives make the development of solar energy projects more competitive by providing tax credits and accelerated depreciation for a portion of the development costs, decreasing the costs associated with developing such projects or creating demand for renewable energy assets through RPS programs. A loss or reduction in such incentives or the value of such incentives or a reduction in the capacity of potential investors to benefit from such incentives could decrease the attractiveness of solar energy projects to project developers, including our Sponsors, and the attractiveness of solar power systems to utilities and DG Solar customers, which could reduce our acquisition opportunities. Such a loss or reduction could also reduce our willingness to pursue solar energy projects due to higher operating costs or lower revenues from offtake agreements.\nThe current administration\u2019s proposed environmental and tax policies may create regulatory uncertainty in the clean energy sector, including the solar energy sector, and may lead to a reduction or removal of various clean energy programs and initiatives designed to curtail climate change. Such a reduction or removal of incentives may diminish the market for future solar energy offtake agreements and reduce the ability for solar developers to compete for future solar energy offtake agreements, which may reduce incentives for project developers, including our Sponsors, to develop such projects. The ITC is a U.S. federal incentive that provides an income tax credit to the owner of the project after the project commences construction of up to 30% of eligible basis. A solar energy project must commence construction prior to January 1, 2020 and be placed in service prior to January 1, 2024, to qualify for the 30% ITC. A solar project that commences construction during 2020 and is placed in service prior to January 1, 2024, may qualify for an ITC equal to 26% of eligible basis. Under the Modified Accelerated Cost-Recovery System, owners of equipment used in a solar project generally claim all of their depreciation deductions with respect to such equipment over five years, even though the useful life of such equipment is generally greater than five years. To the extent that these policies are changed in a manner that reduces the incentives or the value of such incentives or reduces the capacity of potential investors to benefit from such incentives that benefit our projects, they could generate reduced revenues and reduced economic returns, experience increased financing costs and encounter difficulty obtaining financing. The current administration has made public statements and issued Executive Orders regarding overturning or modifying policies of or regulations enacted by the prior administration that placed limitations on coal and gas electric generation, mining and/or exploration. Any effort to overturn federal and state laws, regulations or policies that are supportive of solar energy generation or that remove costs or other limitations on other types of generation that compete with solar energy projects could materially and adversely affect our business.\nAdditionally, some U.S. states with RPS targets have met, or in the near future will meet, their renewable energy targets. For example, California, which has among the most aggressive RPS laws in the United States, is poised to meet its current mandate of 33% renewable energy by 2020 with already-proposed new renewable energy projects, though significant additional investments will be required to meet the higher 50% renewable energy mandate that was adopted in 2015. If, as a result of achieving these targets, these and other U.S. states do not increase their targets in the near future, demand for additional renewable energy could decrease. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nWarranties provided by the suppliers of equipment for our assets and maintenance obligations of the operators of our assets may be limited by the ability of a supplier and/or operator to satisfy its warranty or performance obligations or by the expiration of applicable time or liability limits, which could reduce or void the warranty protections or maintenance obligations, or may be limited in scope or magnitude of liabilities, and thus the warranties and maintenance obligations may be inadequate to protect us.\nOur Sponsors are a significant source of our warranty and maintenance coverage under a number of related party agreements, including EPC agreements, O&M agreements and warranty agreements, including product quality and performance warranties. Certain of these warranties are also provided by other sources, including the suppliers of equipment for our assets, among others. In the event that such warranty providers or operators, including our Sponsors, file for bankruptcy, cease operations or otherwise become unable or unwilling to fulfill their warranty obligations, we may not be adequately protected by such warranties. Even if such warranty providers or operators fulfill their obligations, the warranty or maintenance obligations may not be sufficient to protect us against losses. In addition, these warranties have a term of at least one year, in the case of certain system warranties provided by EPC providers, to 25 years, in the case of manufacturer module warranties, after the date each equipment item is delivered or commissioned. These warranties are subject to liability and other limits. If we seek warranty protection and a warranty provider is unable or unwilling to perform its warranty obligations, or if an operator is unable or unwilling to perform its maintenance obligations, whether as a result of its financial condition or otherwise, or if the term of the warranty or maintenance obligation has expired or a liability limit has been reached, there may be a reduction or loss of protection for the affected assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our Sponsors, and any deterioration of our Sponsors\u2019 creditworthiness could adversely affect our business, our credit ratings and our overall risk profile.\nWe are subject to the credit risk of our Sponsors, and any downgrades or any material deterioration of our Sponsors\u2019 creditworthiness could have significant negative consequences to our business or financial condition. For example:\n\u2022\ndue to increased borrowing costs or an inability to raise capital, which could limit our ability to pursue acquisitions from them, and either or both of the Sponsors may be unable or unwilling to develop additional solar energy projects;\n\u2022\nas a result of our relationship with our Sponsors, investors may lose confidence in our financial condition and our ability to make distributions to our Class A shareholders, and the trading price of our Class A shares may decline;\n\u2022\neither or both of our Sponsors may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their indemnity, reimbursement and other payment obligations under the Omnibus Agreement; and\n\u2022\neither or both of our Sponsors may be unable or unwilling to perform the services for which we have contracted with them under various O&M agreements, AMAs, warranties, guarantees and EPC agreements, and we may be unable to secure adequate replacement arrangements.\nIn the event that either or both of our Sponsors file for bankruptcy, cease operations or otherwise become unable or unwilling to fulfill their contractual obligations, including as described in the third and fourth subbullets above, we may not be adequately protected by such make-whole, indemnification and other such arrangements.\nIn addition, the credit and business risk profiles of our general partner and our Sponsors may be considered in credit evaluations of us because our general partner, which is owned by our Sponsors, controls our business activities, including our and OpCo\u2019s cash distribution policy. Any adverse change in the financial condition of First Solar or SunPower, including the degree of its financial leverage and its dependence on cash flows from us to service its indebtedness, may adversely affect our credit ratings and risk profile. If we were to seek a credit rating, our credit rating may be adversely affected by the leverage of our general partner, First Solar or SunPower, as credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services, Moody\u2019s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, Inc. may consider the leverage and credit profile of First Solar or SunPower because of their ownership interests in and control of us. Any adverse effect on our credit rating would increase our cost of borrowing or hinder our ability to raise financing in the capital markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nWe rely on interconnection and transmission facilities of third parties to deliver energy from our utility projects. If these facilities become unavailable, our projects may not be able to operate or deliver energy.\nWe depend on interconnection and transmission facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver the energy from our utility projects. Many of the interconnection and transmission arrangements for the utility projects in our Portfolio are governed by separate agreements with the owners of the transmission or distribution system. Congestion, emergencies, maintenance, outages, overloads, requests by other parties for transmission service and other events beyond our control could partially or completely curtail deliveries of energy by our utility projects and increase project costs. In addition, any termination of a utility project\u2019s interconnection or transmission arrangements or non-compliance by an interconnection provider or another third party with its obligations under an interconnection or transmission arrangement may delay or prevent our projects from delivering energy to our contractual counterparties. If the interconnection or transmission arrangement for a utility project is terminated, we may not be able to replace it on similar terms to the existing arrangement, or at all, or we may experience significant delays or costs in connection with such replacement. Moreover, if we acquire any utility projects that are under construction or development, a failure or delay in the construction or development of interconnection or transmission facilities could delay the completion of the project. The unavailability of interconnection or transmission could adversely affect the operation of our utility projects and the revenues received, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nThe development of utility-scale solar energy projects by our Sponsors and third parties face risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, the environment, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements.\nUtility-scale project development is a capital intensive business that relies heavily on the availability of debt and equity financing sources (including tax equity investments) to fund projected construction and other development-related capital expenditures. As a result, in order to successfully develop a utility-scale solar energy project, development companies, including our Sponsors, often require sufficient financing to complete the development phase of their projects. Any significant disruption in the credit and capital markets, the credit profile or financial condition of project development companies, including our Sponsors, or a significant increase in interest rates could make it difficult for development companies, including our Sponsors, to raise or access funds when needed to secure construction financing, which would limit a project developer\u2019s ability to obtain financing to complete the construction of a utility-scale solar energy project we may seek to acquire. For example, the 2017 Tax Act, which was signed into law December 22, 2017, enacted major changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws, including a permanent reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate effective January 1, 2018. This reduction in the corporate income tax rate could diminish the capacity of potential investors to benefit from incentives and reduce the value of accelerated depreciation deductions. The availability of tax equity financing with respect to any future acquisitions by us may also be affected by other aspects of the 2017 Tax Act or other future tax law changes, potentially reducing the federal tax benefits of an investment in renewable energy assets to tax equity investors. Such a reduction of these tax benefits could cause a material adverse effect on the willingness of investors to provide tax equity financing.\nUtility-scale project development also requires the successful negotiation and execution of a variety of project contracts, including contracts related to offtake, transmission (in the case of utility-scale solar energy projects), siting, land use and other arrangements with a variety of third parties. Failure to execute project contracts, or the lack of available economically attractive offtake agreements, would limit the ability of a project developer to complete development of a project, which would limit the projects available to us to acquire.\nProject developers, including our Sponsors, develop, construct, manage, own and operate utility-scale solar energy generation and transmission facilities. A key component of their businesses is their ability to construct and operate generation and transmission facilities to meet customer needs. As part of these activities, project developers and EPC providers must periodically apply for licenses and permits from various regulatory authorities and abide by their respective conditions and requirements. If project developers and EPC providers, including our Sponsors, are unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits on acceptable terms or encounter delays in obtaining or renewing such licenses or permits, or if regulatory authorities initiate any associated investigations or enforcement actions or impose penalties or reject projects, the potential number of solar energy projects that may be available for us to acquire may be reduced or potential transaction opportunities may be delayed.\nIf we choose to acquire solar energy projects before COD in the future, we will be subject to risks associated with the acquisition of solar energy projects that remain under construction, which could result in our inability to complete construction projects on time or at all, and make solar energy projects too expensive to complete or cause the return on an investment to be less than expected.\nAs part of our acquisition strategy or if we need to qualify for tax incentives, we may choose to acquire other solar energy projects that have not yet commenced operations and remain under construction. There may be delays or unexpected developments in completing any future construction projects, which could cause the construction costs of these projects to exceed our expectations, result in substantial delays or prevent the project from commencing commercial operation. Various factors could contribute to construction-cost overruns, construction halts or delays or failure to commence commercial operation, including:\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, necessary permits and licenses;\n\u2022\ndelays and increased costs related to the interconnection of new projects to the transmission system;\n\u2022\nthe inability to acquire or maintain land use and access rights;\n\u2022\nthe failure to receive contracted third-party services;\n\u2022\ninterruptions to dispatch at our projects;\n\u2022\nsupply interruptions;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes;\n\u2022\nweather interferences;\n\u2022\nforce majeure events;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws;\n\u2022\nunforeseen engineering, environmental and geological problems, including discoveries of contamination, protected plant or animal species or habitat, archaeological or cultural resources or other environment-related factors;\n\u2022\nunanticipated cost overruns in excess of budgeted contingencies; and\n\u2022\nfailure of contracting parties to perform under contracts, including the EPC provider.\nIn addition, where we have a relationship with a third party to complete construction of any construction project, we are subject to the viability and performance of the third party. Our inability to find a replacement contracting party, where the original contracting party has failed to perform, could result in the abandonment of the construction of such project, while we could remain obligated under other agreements associated with the project, including offtake agreements, which may result in a default or termination of such offtake agreement.\nAny of these risks could cause our financial returns on these investments to be lower than expected or otherwise delay or prevent the completion of such projects or distribution of cash to us, or could cause us to operate below expected capacity or availability levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nTerrorist or similar attacks could impact our utility projects or surrounding areas and adversely affect our business.\nTerrorists have attacked energy assets such as substations and related infrastructure in the past and may attack them in the future. Any attacks on our utility projects or the facilities of third parties on which our utility projects rely could severely damage such projects, disrupt business operations, result in loss of service to customers and require significant time and expense to repair. Additionally, energy-related facilities, such as substations and related infrastructure, are protected by limited security measures, in most cases only perimeter fencing. Cyber-attacks, including those targeting information systems or electronic control systems used to operate our utility projects and the facilities of third parties on which our utility projects rely could severely disrupt business operations, result in loss of service to customers and significant expense to repair security breaches or system damage. Our Portfolio, as well as projects we may acquire and the facilities of third parties on which our projects rely, may be targets of terrorist acts and affected by responses to terrorist acts, each of which could fully or partially\ndisrupt our projects\u2019 ability to produce, transmit, transport and distribute energy. A terrorist act or similar attack could significantly decrease revenues or result in significant reconstruction or remediation costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nWe are not able to insure against all potential risks and we may become subject to higher insurance premiums.\nWe are exposed to numerous risks inherent in the operation of solar energy projects, including equipment or system failure, manufacturing defects, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, sabotage, vandalism and environmental risks. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in substantial liability to us, including being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for environmental cleanup costs, personal injury, property damage, fines and penalties.\nWe currently maintain general liability insurance coverage for ourselves and our affiliates, which covers legal and contractual liabilities arising out of bodily injury, personal injury or property damage, including resulting loss of use, to third parties. Where we maintain majority ownership in a solar energy project, we also maintain coverage for ourselves and our affiliates for physical damage to assets and resulting business interruption. However, such policies do not cover all potential losses and coverage is not always available in the insurance market on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our assets may be immediately claimed by lenders under our financing arrangements or otherwise may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without a negative impact on our results of operations and our ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders. To the extent we experience covered losses under our insurance policies, the limit of our coverage for potential losses may be decreased. Furthermore, the losses that are insured through commercial insurance are subject to the credit risk of those insurance companies. While we believe our commercial insurance providers are currently creditworthy, we cannot assure you that such insurance companies will remain so in the future.\nWe may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. The insurance coverage we do obtain may contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain risks or all potential losses. In addition, our insurance policies are subject to annual review by our insurers and may not be renewed on similar or favorable terms, including coverage, deductibles or premiums, or at all. If a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not fully insured or we suffer losses due to one or more of our insurance carriers defaulting on their obligations or contesting their coverage obligations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nOur business is subject to liabilities and operating restrictions arising from environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.\nOur projects are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, guidelines, policies, directives, government approvals, permit requirements and other requirements governing or relating to, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe protection of wildlife;\n\u2022\nthe presence or discovery of archaeological, religious or cultural resources at or near our operations; and\n\u2022\nthe protection of workers\u2019 health and safety.\nIf our projects do not comply with such laws, regulations or requirements, we may be required to pay penalties or fines, or curtail or cease operations of the affected projects. Violations of environmental and other laws, regulations and permit requirements, including certain violations of laws protecting wetlands and threatened or endangered species, may also result in criminal sanctions or injunctions. In addition, our projects require various government approvals and permits. In some cases, these approvals and permits require periodic renewal and a subsequently-issued approval or permit may not be consistent with the approval or permit initially issued. We cannot predict whether all approvals or permits required for a given asset will be granted or whether the conditions associated with the approvals or permits will be achievable. The denial or loss of an approval or permit essential to an asset or the imposition of impractical conditions upon renewal could impair our ability to construct and/or operate an asset.\nOur utility-scale solar energy projects also carry inherent environmental, health and safety risks, including the potential for related civil litigation, regulatory compliance, remediation orders, fines and other penalties. For instance, our projects could malfunction or experience other unplanned events resulting in personal injury, fines or property damage. Our projects may be constructed and operated on properties that have preexisting releases of hazardous substances or other preexisting environmental conditions that carry health and safety risks, including the potential for related civil litigation, regulatory\ncompliance, remediation orders, fines and other penalties, regardless of whether we knew of or exacerbated the preexisting release or preexisting condition.\nAdditionally, we may be held liable for related investigatory costs, which are typically not limited by law or regulation, for any property where there has been a release or potential release of a hazardous substance, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release or potential release. We could also be liable for other costs, including fines, personal injury or property damage or damage to natural resources. In addition, some environmental laws place a lien on a contaminated site in favor of the government as security for damages and costs it may incur for contamination and cleanup. Contained or uncontained hazardous substances on, under or near our projects, regardless of whether we own or lease the sited property, or the inability to remove or otherwise remediate such substances may restrict or eliminate our ability to operate our projects.\nOur utility-scale solar energy projects are designed specifically for the landscape of each project site and cover a large area. As such, archaeological discoveries could occur at such projects at any time. Such discoveries could result in the restriction or elimination of our ability to operate our business at such project. Utility-scale projects and operations may cause impacts to certain landscape views, trails, or traditional cultural activities. Such impacts may trigger claims from citizens that our projects are infringing upon their legal rights or other claims, resulting in the restriction or elimination of our ability to operate our business at any project.\nEnvironmental, health and safety laws and regulations have generally become more stringent over time, and we expect this trend to continue. Significant capital and operating costs may be incurred at any time to keep our projects in compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. If it is not economical to make those expenditures, or if we violate any of these laws and regulations, it may be necessary to retire projects or restrict or modify our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nWe are subject to risks associated with litigation or administrative proceedings that could materially impact our operations, including future proceedings related to projects we subsequently acquire.\nWe are subject to risks and costs, including potential negative publicity, associated with lawsuits or claims contesting the operation of our projects. The result and costs of defending any such lawsuit, regardless of the merits and eventual outcome, may be material. For example, individuals and interest groups may sue to challenge the issuance of a permit for a project or seek to enjoin a project\u2019s operations. Any such legal proceedings or disputes could materially delay our ability to complete construction of a project in a timely manner or at all or materially increase the costs associated with commencing or continuing a project\u2019s commercial operation. Settlement of claims and unfavorable outcomes or developments relating to these proceedings or disputes, such as judgments for monetary damages, injunctions or denial or revocation of permits, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nOur projects may be adversely affected by legislative changes or a failure to comply with applicable energy regulations.\nCertain of our Project Entities and offtake counterparties are subject to regulation by U.S. federal, state and local authorities. The wholesale sale of electric energy in the continental United States, other than certain areas in Texas, is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, and the ability of a Project Entity to charge the negotiated rates contained in its offtake agreement is subject to that project company\u2019s maintenance of its general authorization from FERC to sell electricity at market-based rates or maintaining an exemption from such requirement. FERC may revoke a Project Entity\u2019s market-based rate authorization if it determines that the Project Entity can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry or has engaged in abusive affiliate transactions. The negotiated rates entered into under the Project Entities\u2019 offtake agreements could be changed by FERC if it determined such change is in the public interest. While this threshold public interest determination would require extraordinary circumstances under FERC precedent, if FERC decreases the prices paid to us for energy delivered under any of our offtake agreements, our revenues could be below our projections and our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders could be materially adversely affected.\nOur Project Entities, with the exception of our DG Solar projects, are subject to the mandatory reliability standards of the NERC. The NERC reliability standards are a series of requirements that relate to maintaining the reliability of the North American bulk electric system and cover a wide variety of topics including physical and cybersecurity of critical assets, information protocols, frequency and voltage standards, testing, documentation and outage management. If we fail to comply with these standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties. Although our Utility Project Entities are not subject to state utility rate regulation because they sell energy exclusively on a wholesale basis, we are subject to other state regulations that may affect our projects\u2019 sale of energy and operations. Changes in state regulatory treatment are\nunpredictable and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nWith few material federal regulatory policies driving the growth of renewable energy, each U.S. state has its own renewable energy regulations and policies. Renewable energy developers must anticipate the future policy direction in each state and province and secure viable projects before they can bid to procure an offtake agreement or other contract through often highly competitive auctions. A failure to anticipate accurately the future policy direction in a jurisdiction or to secure viable projects could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nThe structure of the industry and regulation in the United States is currently, and may continue to be, subject to challenges and restructuring proposals. Additional regulatory approvals may be required due to changes in law or for other reasons. We expect the laws and regulation applicable to our business and the energy industry generally to be in a state of transition for the foreseeable future. Changes in such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nOur DG Solar business depends in part on the regulatory treatment of third-party owned solar power systems.\nAlthough we own the underlying solar power systems of our DG Solar projects, because we lease such systems to our residential DG Solar customers, their DG Solar offtake agreements are considered third-party ownership arrangements. Therefore, DG Solar customers are considered non-owner third parties. Sales of electricity by third parties face regulatory challenges in some U.S. states and jurisdictions. Other challenges pertain to whether third-party owned solar power systems qualify for the same levels of rebates, tax exemptions or other non-tax incentives available for customer-owned solar power systems and whether third-party owned solar power systems are eligible at all for these incentives. Reductions in, or eliminations of, rebates or incentives for these third-party ownership arrangements could reduce demand for our solar power systems, adversely impact our access to capital and could cause us to increase the price we charge our customers for energy.\nA failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to our interactions with current or prospective residential customers could result in negative publicity, claims, investigations, and litigation, and adversely affect our financial performance.\nA segment of our business focuses on transactions with residential customers. We must comply with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern matters relating to our interactions with residential consumers, including those pertaining to privacy and data security, consumer financial and credit transactions, home improvement contracts, warranties and door-to-door solicitation. These laws and regulations are dynamic and subject to potentially differing interpretations, and various federal, state and local legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current laws or regulations, or enact new laws and regulations, regarding these matters. Changes in these laws or regulations or their interpretation could dramatically affect how we do business, acquire customers, and manage and use information we collect from and about current and prospective customers and the costs associated therewith. We strive to comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to our interactions with residential customers. It is possible, however, that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Our non-compliance with any such law or regulations could also expose the company to claims, proceedings, litigation and investigations by private parties and regulatory authorities, as well as substantial fines and negative publicity, each of which may materially and adversely affect our business. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with such laws and regulations, and increased regulation of matters relating to our interactions with residential consumers could require us to modify our operations and incur significant additional expenses, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information of our customers. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between one company and its subsidiaries, and among the subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations. Several jurisdictions have passed new laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements may cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices. A failure by us, our suppliers or other parties with whom we do business to comply with a posted privacy policies or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, which could have a detrimental effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could be adversely affected by any violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and foreign anti-bribery laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have implemented policies mandating compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We currently only operate in the United States. However, we may acquire businesses outside of the United States and operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. In addition, due to the level of regulation in our industry, our entry into new jurisdictions through acquisitions requires substantial government contact where norms can differ from U.S. standards. While we have implemented policies and procedures and conduct training designed to facilitate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, thereby mitigating the risk of violations of such laws, the employees of our Sponsors, subcontractors and agents may take actions in violation of our policies and anti-bribery laws. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could subject us to criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.\nWe may not be able to extend, renew or replace expiring or terminated offtake agreements at favorable rates or on a long-term basis.\nAs of November 30, 2017, the weighted average remaining life of offtake agreements across our Portfolio was 19.1 years. Our ability to extend, renew or replace our existing offtake agreements depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nwhether the offtake counterparty has a continued need for energy at the time of expiration, which could be affected by, among other things, the presence or absence of governmental incentives or mandates, prevailing market prices and the availability of other energy sources;\n\u2022\nthe satisfactory performance of our delivery obligations under such offtake agreements;\n\u2022\nthe regulatory environment applicable to our offtake counterparties at the time;\n\u2022\nmacroeconomic factors present at the time, such as population, business trends and related energy demand; and\n\u2022\nthe effects of regulation on the contracting practices of our offtake counterparties.\nIf we are not able to extend, renew or replace on acceptable terms existing utility offtake agreements before contract expiration, or if such agreements are otherwise terminated in accordance with their terms prior to their expiration, we may be forced to sell the energy on an uncontracted basis at prevailing market prices, which could be materially lower than we received under the offtake agreement. Alternatively, if there is no market for a project\u2019s uncontracted energy or we lose access to or the right to occupy and use the land on which a project sits, we may be required to decommission the project before the end of its useful life. Additionally, if we are not able to extend or renew our DG Solar offtake agreements before contract expiration, or if such agreements are otherwise terminated in accordance with their terms prior to expiration, we will lose all revenue with respect to such projects. Any failure to extend or replace a significant portion of our existing offtake agreements, or extending, renewing or replacing them at lower prices or with other unfavorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nCertain of the offtake agreements in our Portfolio and offtake agreements that we may enter into in the future contain or may contain provisions that allow the offtake counterparty to terminate the agreement or buyout all or a portion of the asset upon the occurrence of certain events. If these provisions are exercised and we are unable to enter into an offtake agreement on similar terms, in the case of a termination, or find suitable replacement assets to invest in, in the case of a buyout, our cash available for distribution could materially decline.\nCertain of the offtake agreements in our Portfolio and offtake agreements that we may enter into in the future allow or may allow the offtake counterparty to purchase all or a portion of the applicable asset from us. For example, pursuant to the offtake agreements for several of our solar assets, the offtake counterparty has the option to either (i) purchase the applicable solar power system, no earlier than year six after COD of the system, and for a purchase price equal to the greater of a value specified in the contact or the fair market value of the asset determined at the time of exercise of the purchase option or (ii) pay an early termination fee as specified in the contract, terminate the contact and require the project company owned by us to remove the applicable solar power system from the site. If the offtake counterparty of the asset exercises its right to purchase the asset or terminate the offtake agreement, we would need to reinvest the proceeds from the sale or termination payment in one or more assets with similar economic attributes to maintain our cash available for distribution. If we were unable to locate\nand acquire suitable replacement assets in a timely manner, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our Class A shareholders.\nIn addition, some of the offtake agreements in our Portfolio and offtake agreements we may enter into in the future allow or may allow the offtake counterparty to terminate the offtake agreement in the event certain operating thresholds or performance measures are not achieved within specified time periods. In the event an offtake agreement for one or more of our assets is terminated under such provisions, it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash available for distribution until we are able to replace the offtake agreement on similar terms. We cannot provide any assurance that offtake agreements containing such provisions will not be terminated or, in the event of termination, we will be able to enter into a replacement offtake agreement. Furthermore, any replacement offtake agreement may be on terms less favorable to us than the offtake agreement that was terminated.\nA material drop in the price and or increase in the availability of other energy sources would harm our ability to acquire accretive utility projects.\nA utility\u2019s decision to buy renewable energy may be affected by the cost of other energy sources, including nuclear, coal, natural gas and oil, as well as other sources of renewable energy. For example, low natural gas prices have led, in some instances, to increased natural gas consumption in lieu of other energy sources. To the extent renewable energy, particularly solar energy, becomes less cost-competitive due to reduced government targets and incentives that favor renewable energy, cheaper alternatives or otherwise, demand for solar energy and other forms of renewable energy could decrease. Slow growth or a long-term reduction in the energy demand could cause a reduction in the development of utility-scale solar energy projects.\nThe price of electricity from utilities could also decrease as a result of:\n\u2022\nthe construction of additional electric transmission and distribution lines;\n\u2022\na reduction in the price of natural gas as a result of new drilling techniques, oversupply of natural gas or a relaxation of associated regulatory standards;\n\u2022\ngovernmental subsidies or policies benefiting non-renewable energy sources;\n\u2022\nthe energy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce electricity consumption; and\n\u2022\ndevelopment of new renewable energy technologies that provide less expensive energy.\nDecreases in the prices of electricity from the utilities could affect our ability to acquire accretive assets, as our Sponsors and other renewable energy developers may not be able to compete with providers of other energy sources at such lower utility wholesale prices. Our inability to acquire accretive assets could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nA material drop in the price of retail electricity from utilities would harm our ability to acquire accretive C&I and residential assets.\nA reduction in utility electricity prices would make the purchase of solar power systems or the purchase of energy under offtake agreements less economically attractive to residential and C&I customers. In addition, a shift in the timing of peak rates for utility-generated electricity to a time of day when solar energy generation is less efficient could make solar power system offerings less competitive and reduce demand for such solar power systems. If the price of energy available from utilities were to decrease due to any of these reasons, or otherwise, we would be unable to acquire accretive DG Solar assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and make distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nThe C&I market for energy is particularly sensitive to price changes. Typically, C&I customers pay less for energy from utilities than residential customers. Because the price we are able to charge C&I customers is only slightly lower than their current retail rate, any decline in the retail rate of energy for C&I entities could have a significant impact on the development of the C&I market due to the inability to attract additional C&I customers.\nIf the price of energy available from utilities were to decrease due to any of these reasons, or others, we would be unable to acquire accretive residential and C&I assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and make distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nWe generally do not own any of the land on which the projects in our Portfolio are located and our use and enjoyment of the property may be adversely affected to the extent that there are any interest owners, lienholders or leaseholders that have rights that are superior to our rights.\nWe generally do not own any of the land on which the projects in our Portfolio are located and they generally are, and our future projects may be, located on land occupied under long-term easements, leases, licenses and rights of way. The fee ownership interests in the land subject to these easements, leases, licenses and rights of way may be subject to mortgages securing loans or other liens and other easements, lease rights, licenses and rights of way of third parties that were created prior to, or which are otherwise superior to, our projects\u2019 easements, leases and rights of way. As a result, some of our projects\u2019 rights under such easements, leases, licenses or rights of way may be subject to the rights of these third parties. While we generally perform title searches and obtain title insurance (except for the Kern Project, the Macy\u2019s California Project and the Macy\u2019s Maryland Project or where title insurance is commercially unobtainable), record our interests in the real property records of the projects\u2019 localities and enter into non-disturbance agreements (when appropriate) to protect ourselves against such risks, such measures may be inadequate to protect against all risk that our rights to use the land on which our projects are or will be located and our projects\u2019 rights to such easements, leases, licenses and rights of way could be lost, interrupted or curtailed. Any such loss, interruption or curtailment of our rights to use the land on which our projects are or will be located could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nInformation technology system failures, or network disruptions and security breaches, including cybersecurity breaches, could damage our business operations, financial conditions, or reputation.\nThe secure maintenance of information and information technology systems is critical to our business operations. We may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. These may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events or disruptions. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. System failures and disruptions could impede transactions processing and financial reporting.\nIn addition, our infrastructure may be increasingly vulnerable to attacks by hackers or terrorists as a result of the rise in the sophistication and volume of cyberattacks. Any such cyberattack or breach could: (i) compromise our projects thereby adversely affecting generation and transmission to the grid; (ii) adversely affect our business operations; (iii) corrupt data; or (iv) result in unauthorized access to the information stored on our networks, including, company proprietary information and employee data causing the information to be publicly disclosed, lost or stolen or result in incidents that could result in harmful effects on the environment and human health, including loss of life. Any such attack, breach, access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in lost revenue, the inability to conduct critical business functions, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, increased regulation, increased protection costs for enhanced cyber security systems or personnel, damage to our reputation and the rendering of our disclosure controls and procedures ineffective, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nIn addition, our directors and officers may be subject to class action lawsuits relating to the Mergers, and other additional lawsuits that may be filed. Such litigation is common in connection with acquisitions of public companies, regardless of any merits related to the underlying acquisition. For more information about the risks associated with potential lawsuits, please read Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Our Merger with Capital Dynamics-We may be subject to class action lawsuits relating to the Mergers, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results or prevent or delay completion of the Mergers.\u201d\nIf solar energy technology is not suitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return, or if sufficient additional demand for solar power systems does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate, our ability to acquire accretive projects may decrease.\nThe solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development, in comparison to fossil fuel-based electricity generation. If solar energy technology proves unsuitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if additional demand for solar power systems fails to develop sufficiently or takes longer to develop than we anticipate, we may be unable to acquire additional accretive projects to grow our business. In addition, demand for solar power systems in our targeted markets may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate. Many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption of solar energy technology and demand for solar power systems, including the following:\n\u2022\navailability, substance and magnitude of support programs including government targets, subsidies, incentives, renewable portfolio standards and residential net ownership rules to accelerate the development of the solar energy industry;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in economic and market conditions that affect the price of, and demand for, conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources, such as increases or decreases in the price of natural gas, coal, oil and other fossil fuels and the cost-effectiveness of the electricity generated by solar power systems compared to such sources and other non-solar renewable energy sources, such as wind;\n\u2022\nchanges to government regulations and policies may present technical, regulatory, and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar power products;\n\u2022\nperformance, reliability and availability of energy generated by solar power systems compared to conventional and other non-solar renewable energy sources and products;\n\u2022\ncompetitiveness of other renewable energy generation technologies, such as hydroelectric, tidal, wind, geothermal, solar thermal, concentrated solar and biomass;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in capital expenditures by end-users of solar power systems which tend to decrease when the economy slows and when interest rates increase; and\n\u2022\navailability of certain solar technology and suitability for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if additional demand for solar technology fails to develop sufficiently or takes longer to develop than we anticipate.\nSolar energy failing to achieve or being significantly delayed in achieving widespread adoption could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nOur Residential Portfolio and certain of our C&I solar energy projects rely on net metering and other policies to offer competitive pricing to our customers in some of our key markets and to facilitate interconnection of new customers.\nMost U.S. states, along with Washington, D.C., American Samoa, U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering, or net metering. Most of the states where we currently serve customers have adopted a net metering policy. Net metering allows our customers who own grid-connected DG Solar assets to pay the utility only for electricity used net of electricity generated by their solar system. At the end of the billing period, the customer simply pays for the net energy used or receives a credit at the retail rate if more energy is produced than consumed. Utilities that are not subject to a net metering policy typically compensate customers for solar electricity that is exported to the grid at a price lower than the retail price, usually a fixed rate or an \u201cavoided cost\u201d rate that is a proxy for the wholesale price of electricity.\nNet metering policies have received recent scrutiny from legislatures and regulators. Some states, including but not limited to Arizona and Hawaii, have ended net metering on a prospective basis, grandfathering in existing residential customers for a set period of time. New York has replaced net metering on a prospective basis (subject to grandfathering for residential and certain commercial customers for a set period of time) with a \u201cvalue of solar\u201d tariff that values excess energy produced by a distributed generation system based on certain attributes, instead of at the retail rate. California has retained net metering for customers served by investor-owned utilities, but permits those utilities to impose certain additional charges. Our Residential Portfolio and certain of our C&I solar energy projects may be adversely impacted by the elimination of net metering where it is currently in place, the failure to adopt a net metering policy where it currently is not in place, the failure to expand caps on the availability of net metering to new customers in states that have implemented them, or reductions in the amount or value of credit that customers receive through net metering.\nIn addition, our Residential Portfolio and certain of our C&I solar energy projects may be adversely impacted by the unavailability of expedited or simplified interconnection for grid-tied solar power systems, delays in interconnection or any limitation on the number of customer interconnections or amount of solar energy that utilities are required to allow in their service territory or some part of the grid.\nUtilities in some states, including (but not limited to) Arizona, California and Hawaii, have also adopted or proposed new rates or charges that only or disproportionately impact customers that install distributed generation systems or utilize net metering. For example, utilities in some states have proposed or received approval for imposing additional interconnection or monthly charges on customers who interconnect solar power systems installed on their homes or requiring those customers to receive service under \u201ctime of use\u201d rates that provide for different rates during different periods of the day and that could result in a reduction in the amount or value of credits. If such rates or charges are imposed, the cost savings associated with solar\nenergy for current and prospective customers may be significantly reduced and our ability to expand our Residential Portfolio and compete with traditional utility providers could be impacted.\nLimits on net metering, interconnection of solar power systems and other operational policies in key markets could limit the number of solar power systems installed in those markets. If net metering is eliminated or replaced, if caps on net metering are reached, if the amount or value of credit that customers receive for net metering is significantly reduced, or if the utility imposes new rates or changes impacting customers who install distributed generation systems or utilize net metering, current or future customers will be unable to recognize the current cost savings associated with solar energy and net metering. Net metering is used to establish competitive pricing for prospective customers and the absence of net metering and other favorable policies for new customers would impair our ability to compete with utilities and other electricity providers and greatly limit demand for residential solar power systems.\nUntil we can effectively utilize tax benefits, we expect to be dependent on the availability of third-party tax equity financing arrangements, which may not be available in the future.\nA goal of developers and owners of renewable energy assets, including our Sponsors, is to utilize the tax benefits produced by these projects. However, we cannot effectively utilize those benefits currently and may not be able to utilize them in the future. As such, we may acquire projects in the future that include third-party tax equity financing to utilize tax benefits available to certain renewable energy assets. However, no assurance can be given that tax equity investors will be available or willing to invest on acceptable terms at the time of any such acquisition or that the tax incentives and benefits that are needed to make tax equity financing available will remain in place. Tax equity investors have invested in and provided a significant amount of the permanent capital needed for the U.S. assets in our Portfolio and we expect to have similar arrangements for assets we acquire in the future, including any of the SunPower ROFO Projects. In a typical tax equity financing, a tax equity investor makes a capital investment in a class of equity interests of the entity that directly or indirectly owns the physical asset or assets. However, the availability of tax equity financing depends on federal tax incentives that encourage renewable energy development. These incentives primarily include (i) ITCs, which are federal income tax credits equal to (a) 30% multiplied by the basis of eligible assets that commence construction prior to January 1, 2020 and are placed in service before January 1, 2024; (b) 26% multiplied by the basis of eligible assets that commence construction during 2020 and are placed in service before January 1, 2024; (c) 22% multiplied by the basis of eligible assets that commence construction during 2021 and are placed in service before January 1, 2024; and (d) 10% multiplied by the basis of eligible assets that commence construction in 2022 or thereafter or are placed in service on or after January 1, 2024 and (ii) accelerated depreciation of renewable energy assets as calculated under the current tax depreciation system, the modified accelerated cost recovery system of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). No assurance can be given that the federal government will maintain these incentive programs. The reduction or loss of these tax benefits could cause a material adverse effect on the willingness of investors to provide tax equity financing for a portion of the acquisition price of U.S. renewable energy assets, which in turn could impact our ability to make future acquisitions. The 2017 Tax Act, which was signed into law December 22, 2017, enacted major changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws, including a permanent reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate effective January 1, 2018. This reduction in the corporate income tax rate could diminish the capacity of potential investors to benefit from incentives and reduce the value of accelerated depreciation deductions. The availability of tax equity financing with respect to any future acquisitions by us may also be affected by other aspects of the 2017 Tax Act or other future tax law changes, potentially reducing the federal tax benefits of an investment in renewable energy assets to tax equity investors. Such a reduction of these tax benefits could cause a material adverse effect on the willingness of investors to provide tax equity financing.\nCertain of our tax equity financing agreements provide, and tax equity financing arrangements of our future acquisitions may provide, our tax equity investors with a number of minority investor protection rights with respect to the applicable asset or assets that have been financed with tax equity, including restricting the ability of the entity that owns such asset or assets to incur debt. To the extent we want to incur project-level debt at a project in which we co-invest with a tax equity investor, we may be required to obtain the tax equity investor\u2019s consent prior to such incurrence. In addition, the amount of debt that could be incurred by an entity in which we have a tax equity co-investor may be further constrained because even if the tax equity investor consents to the incurrence of the debt at the entity or project level, the tax equity investor may not agree to pledge its interest in the project which could reduce the amount that can be borrowed by the entity.\nFurther, there are a limited number of potential tax equity investors. Such investors have limited funds and renewable energy developers, operators and investors compete against one another and with others for tax equity financing for their capital. Our business strategy depends on the acquisition of additional assets to be able to meet our expected distribution rate. The inability of developers of renewable energy assets to enter into tax equity financing agreements with attractive pricing terms, or at all, could limit our ability to acquire additional assets and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, as the renewable energy industry expands, the cost of tax equity financing may increase and there may not be sufficient tax equity financing available to meet the total demand in any year.\nWhile we currently own only solar energy projects, we may acquire other sources of clean energy and other assets. Any future acquisition of non-renewable energy projects may present unforeseen challenges and result in a competitive disadvantage relative to our more-established competitors.\nWhile we currently only own solar assets, we may in the future choose to acquire other sources of clean energy and other assets, including contracted wind and natural gas, and other types of projects, including land and transmission projects. We may also choose to leverage advancements in technology such as energy storage and increasingly efficient modules to compete against existing renewable generation technologies. We may be unable to identify attractive acquisition opportunities or acquire such projects or technology at a price and on terms that are attractive. In addition, expanding beyond our current expertise may result in our Sponsors not having the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources management and other attributes necessary to operate such assets optimally, which could expose us to increased operating costs, unforeseen liabilities or risks including regulatory and environmental issues associated with entering new sectors of the energy industry, including requiring a disproportionate amount of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have an adverse impact on our business and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to more established market participants. A failure to successfully integrate such acquisitions with our then-existing projects as a result of unforeseen operational difficulties or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with Our Sponsors\nSince the economic and management rights of First Solar and SunPower are impacted by the performance of our business in different ways, First Solar and SunPower may fail to agree on our management, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan.\nUntil November 30, 2019, our Sponsors each own (i) 50% of the economic interests of Holdings, which represent the incentive distribution rights, and (ii) 50% of the management interests of Holdings, which represent the right to govern Holdings and the General Partner. In addition, each of our Sponsors has certain rights to appoint the directors of the General Partner and to nominate the officers of the General Partner for approval by the board of the General Partner. Beginning after November 30, 2019, the economic interests of our Sponsors are subject to adjustment annually based on the relative performance of each Sponsor\u2019s contributed Project Entities and any additional assets contributed to OpCo by such Sponsor against the performance of all Project Entities held by OpCo. If, after the adjustment to a Sponsor\u2019s economic interests, such Sponsor has held at least 70% of the economic interests for at least two consecutive fiscal years, then such Sponsor shall have the option to require the other Sponsor to transfer part of its management interest to such Sponsor, thereby effectively giving such Sponsor management control. In addition, after November 30, 2019, payments on the economic interests of Holdings to our Sponsors are subject to an annual reallocation among the Sponsors based on the relative performance of the assets contributed by each Sponsor compared to the projected performance of such assets at the time of contribution. Each Sponsor can also lose its right to appoint directors and officers of the General Partner in the event such Sponsor (i) holds less than 40% of the economic interests for the three previous fiscal years or (ii) if, in each of such three fiscal years, the cash generated and distributed, subject to certain exclusions, by one Sponsor\u2019s contributed Project Entities and any additional assets contributed by such Sponsor to OpCo prior to the end of the most recent fiscal year is less than 40% of the cash generated and distributed, subject to certain exclusions, by both Sponsors\u2019 contributed Project Entities and any additional assets contributed by both Sponsors to OpCo prior to the end of the most recent fiscal year. In addition, in the event our Sponsors cannot agree on a management decision after a required negotiation period, either Sponsor can initiate a process that will result in the purchase by one Sponsor of the other Sponsor\u2019s interests in Holdings or a sale to a third party. A shift in control to one of our Sponsors could result in significant changes to our business plan, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile these provisions are intended to incentivize our Sponsors to contribute high-performing assets to us, they also cause our Sponsors to have differently aligned interests in us, which could cause them to disagree on certain management decisions, including the timing, selection, cost and financing of acquisitions. While our Sponsors are under no obligation to provide us additional acquisition opportunities, we expect our Sponsors will be our primary source for the acquisition of additional solar energy projects in the future. If our Sponsors do not agree on their management of us, one or both of them may choose not to offer us additional future solar energy projects which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and make distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nThe General Partner and its affiliates, including our Sponsors, have conflicts of interest with us and limited duties to us and our Class A shareholders, and they may favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our Class A shareholders.\nOur Sponsors indirectly own and control the General Partner and appoint all of the General Partner\u2019s officers and directors. All of the General Partner\u2019s executive officers and a majority of the General Partner\u2019s directors also are employees of our Sponsors. Conflicts of interest exist and may arise as a result of the relationships between the General Partner and its affiliates, including our Sponsors, on the one hand, and us and our shareholders, on the other hand. Although the General Partner has a duty to manage us in a manner beneficial to us and our shareholders, the General Partner\u2019s directors and officers have fiduciary duties to manage the General Partner in a manner beneficial to its owner, Holdings, which is owned by our Sponsors. In addition, under the MSAs, First Solar and SunPower each provide certain services or arrange for certain services to be provided to us, including with respect to carrying out our day-to-day management and providing individuals to act as the General Partner\u2019s executive officers. These same executive officers may help the Board evaluate potential acquisition opportunities presented by First Solar under the First Solar ROFO Agreement and SunPower under the SunPower ROFO Agreement.\nIn resolving such conflicts of interest, the General Partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates, including our Sponsors, over the interests of our shareholders. These conflicts include the following situations, among others:\n\u2022\nnone of our Partnership Agreement, the MSAs or any other agreement requires First Solar, SunPower or their affiliates to pursue a business strategy that favors us or dictates what markets to pursue or grow. First Solar\u2019s and SunPower\u2019s directors and officers have a fiduciary duty to make these decisions in the best interests of First Solar and SunPower, respectively, which may be contrary to our interests;\n\u2022\ncontracts between us, on the one hand, and the General Partner and its affiliates, on the other, are not and may not be the result of arm\u2019s-length negotiations;\n\u2022\nthe General Partner\u2019s affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us and neither the General Partner nor its affiliates have any obligation to present business opportunities to us except for the SunPower ROFO Projects if SunPower decides to sell such project during the term of the SunPower ROFO Agreement;\n\u2022\nthe General Partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us, such as First Solar and SunPower, in resolving conflicts of interest;\n\u2022\nwe do not have any officers or employees and rely solely on officers and employees of the General Partner and its affiliates, including First Solar and SunPower. The officers of the General Partner will also devote significant time to the business of First Solar and SunPower and will be compensated by First Solar and SunPower accordingly, as applicable;\n\u2022\nour Partnership Agreement replaces the fiduciary duties that would otherwise be owed by the General Partner with contractual standards governing its duties and limits the General Partner\u2019s liabilities and the remedies available to our shareholders for actions that, without these limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty under applicable Delaware law;\n\u2022\nexcept in limited circumstances, the General Partner has the power and authority to conduct our business without shareholder approval;\n\u2022\nactions taken by the General Partner may affect the amount of cash available to pay distributions to our Class A shareholders;\n\u2022\nthe General Partner determines which costs incurred by it are reimbursable by us;\n\u2022\nwe reimburse the General Partner and its affiliates for expenses;\n\u2022\nthe General Partner intends to limit its liability regarding our contractual and other obligations;\n\u2022\nour Class A shares are subject to the General Partner\u2019s limited call right;\n\u2022\nthe General Partner controls the enforcement of the obligations that it and its affiliates owe to us, including SunPower\u2019s obligations under the SunPower ROFO Agreement and our Sponsors\u2019 other commercial agreements with us; and\n\u2022\nwe may choose not to retain counsel, independent accountants or other advisors separate from those retained by the General Partner to perform services for us or for the holders of our Class A shares.\nA decision by the General Partner to favor its own interests and the interests of our Sponsors over our interests and the interests of our shareholders could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nOur Sponsors and other affiliates of the General Partner are not restricted in their ability to compete with us.\nOur Partnership Agreement provides that the General Partner is restricted from engaging in any business activities other than acting as the General Partner and those activities incidental to its ownership of interests in us. Affiliates of the General Partner, including our Sponsors and their subsidiaries, are not prohibited, including under the MSAs, from owning solar energy projects or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Our Sponsors currently hold interests in, and may make investments in and purchases of, entities that acquire, own and operate other power generators. Our Sponsors will be under no obligation to make any acquisition opportunities available to OpCo, other than under the SunPower ROFO Agreement.\nUnder the terms of our Partnership Agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, does not apply to the General Partner or any of its affiliates, including its executive officers and directors and our Sponsors. Any such person or entity that becomes aware of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for us will not have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to us. Any such person or entity will not be liable to us or to any limited partner for breach of any fiduciary duty or other duty by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another person or entity or does not communicate such opportunity or information to us. This may create actual and potential conflicts of interest between us and affiliates of the General Partner and result in less than favorable treatment of us and holders of our Class A shares.\nIf our Sponsors terminate their respective services agreements or other arrangements with us or our subsidiaries, or either of them defaults in the performance of its obligations thereunder, we may be unable to contract with a substitute service provider on similar terms, or at all, and may not get the expected benefit of such other arrangements.\nWe rely on our Sponsors to provide us with administrative and management services under the MSAs and do not have independent executive or senior management personnel. Under these agreements, certain of our Sponsors\u2019 employees provide services to us. These services are not the primary responsibility of these employees, nor are these employees required to act for us alone. The MSAs do not require our Sponsors to engage any specific individuals for purposes of providing services to us and our Sponsors have the discretion to determine which of their respective employees will perform the services required to be provided to us. Each of the MSAs provides that First Solar and SunPower, respectively, may terminate the applicable agreement (i) upon 30 days\u2019 prior written notice of termination to us if we default in the performance or observance of any material term, condition or covenant contained in the agreement in a manner that results in material harm to First Solar, SunPower or any of their respective affiliates (other than our subsidiaries and us), and the default continues unremedied for a period of 60 days after written notice of the breach is given to us, (ii) upon the happening of certain events relating to the bankruptcy or insolvency of Holdings, the General Partner, OpCo, us or certain OpCo\u2019s subsidiaries, or (iii) if First Solar and SunPower and their respective affiliates (other than our subsidiaries and us) cease to control us. If either First Solar or SunPower terminates its MSA or if either of them defaults in the performance of its obligations thereunder, we may be unable to contract with a substitute service provider on similar terms or at all, and the costs of substituting service providers may be substantial. In addition, our Sponsors are familiar with our projects and, as a result, our Sponsors have certain synergies with us. Substitute service providers would lack such synergies and may not be able to provide the same level of service to us. If we cannot locate a service provider that is able to provide us with substantially similar services as our Sponsors provide under the MSAs on similar terms, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nIn addition, we depend on our Sponsors to provide a substantial portion of the services required for the operation and maintenance and the administration and management of our projects. Our Sponsors may not perform their services as, when and where required. Additionally, in the event that our Sponsors have a dispute, they have agreed to a resolution provision that could ultimately eliminate the ownership of one or both of our Sponsors, allowing such Sponsor(s) to terminate any agreements under which they provide operation and maintenance or administration and management services to us. To the extent that First Solar or SunPower do not fulfill their obligations to manage operations of our projects, are not effective in doing so or terminate the agreements governing such services, we may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to enter into long-term replacement agreements to provide for operation and maintenance and the administration and management of our projects and other required services, we would seek to purchase the related services under short-term agreements, exposing us to market price volatility. In addition, if our Sponsors fail to comply with their indemnification obligations related to tax equity financing arrangements for our current or future projects, we may be required to make payments thereunder, and such payments may be substantial. The failure of First Solar or SunPower to fulfill its\nobligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our Class A shareholders.\nOur arrangements with our Sponsors limit their liability, and we have agreed to indemnify our Sponsors against claims that they may face in connection with such arrangements, which may lead our Sponsors to assume greater risks when making decisions relating to us than they otherwise would if acting solely for their own account.\nUnder the MSAs, our Sponsors and their affiliates have not assumed any responsibility other than to provide or arrange for the provision of the services described in the applicable MSA in good faith. Additionally, under the MSAs, the liability of our Sponsors and their affiliates is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law to conduct involving bad faith, fraud or willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, to action that was known to have been unlawful. We have agreed to indemnify our Sponsors and their affiliates to the fullest extent permitted by law from and against any claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses incurred by an indemnified person or threatened in connection with our operations, investments and activities or in respect of or arising from the MSAs or the services provided by our Sponsors and their affiliates, except to the extent that the claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses are determined to have resulted from the conduct in respect of which such persons have liability as described above. Additionally, the maximum amount of the aggregate liability of our Sponsors or any of their affiliates in providing services under the MSAs or of any director, officer, employee, agent or other representative of our Sponsors or any of their affiliates, is equal to the aggregate amount of the management fee received by the applicable Sponsor in the most recent calendar year. These protections may result in our Sponsors and their affiliates tolerating greater risks when making decisions than otherwise would be the case, including when determining whether to use leverage in connection with acquisitions. The indemnification arrangements to which our Sponsors and their affiliates are a party may also give rise to legal claims for indemnification, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Shares\nHolders of our Class A shares have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect the General Partner or its directors.\nUnlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, our shareholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management\u2019s decisions regarding our business. Our shareholders have no right on an annual or ongoing basis to elect the General Partner or its Board. Rather, the Board is appointed by our Sponsors, indirectly through their ownership of Holdings. Furthermore, if our shareholders are dissatisfied with the performance of the General Partner, they have little ability to remove the General Partner. As a result of these limitations, the price at which the Class A shares trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. Our Partnership Agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of shareholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting the shareholders\u2019 ability to influence the manner or direction of management.\nOur Partnership Agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of our Class A shares for actions taken by the General Partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duties.\nOur Partnership Agreement contains provisions that restrict the remedies available to shareholders for actions taken by the General Partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duties under state fiduciary duty law. For example, our Partnership Agreement provides that:\n\u2022\nwhenever the General Partner, the Board or any committee thereof (including the Conflicts Committee) makes a determination or takes, or declines to take, any other action in their respective capacities, or an affiliate of the general partner causes the general partner to do so, the General Partner, the Board and any committee thereof (including the Conflicts Committee), as applicable, is required to make such determination, or take or decline to take such other action, in good faith, meaning that it subjectively believed that the decision was in, or not adverse to, the best interests of our partnership, and, except as specifically provided by our Partnership Agreement, will not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by our Partnership Agreement, Delaware law, or any other law, rule or regulation, or at equity;\n\u2022\nthe General Partner will not have any liability to us or our shareholders for decisions made in its capacity as a general partner so long as such decisions are made in good faith;\n\u2022\nthe General Partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us or our shareholders resulting from any act or omission unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the General Partner or its officers and directors, as the case may be,\nacted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the conduct was unlawful; and\n\u2022\nthe General Partner will not be in breach of its obligations under our Partnership Agreement (including any duties to us or our shareholders) if a transaction with an affiliate or the resolution of a conflict of interest is:\n\u2022\napproved by the Conflicts Committee, although the General Partner is not obligated to seek such approval;\n\u2022\napproved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares, excluding any shares owned by the General Partner and its affiliates, although the General Partner is not obligated to seek such approval;\n\u2022\ndetermined by the Board to be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties; or\n\u2022\ndetermined by the Board to be fair and reasonable to us, taking into account the totality of the relationships among the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us.\nIn connection with a situation involving a transaction with an affiliate or a conflict of interest, any determination by the General Partner, the Board or any committee thereof (including the Conflicts Committee) must be made in good faith. If an affiliate transaction or the resolution of a conflict of interest is not approved by our shareholders or the Conflicts Committee and the Board determines that the resolution or course of action taken with respect to the affiliate transaction or conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in the third and fourth subbullets above, then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, the Board acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or the partnership challenging such determination, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption.\nOur Partnership Agreement restricts the voting rights of shareholders owning 20% or more of any class of shares then outstanding.\nShareholders\u2019 voting rights are further restricted by a provision of our Partnership Agreement providing that any shares held by a person or related group that owns 20% or more of any class of shares then outstanding, other than the General Partner, its affiliates, their transferees and persons who acquired such shares with the prior approval of the Board, cannot vote on any matter.\nOur Partnership Agreement replaces the General Partner\u2019s fiduciary duties to holders of our Class A shares with contractual standards governing its duties.\nOur Partnership Agreement contains provisions that eliminate the fiduciary standards to which the General Partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law and replace those standards with several different contractual standards. For example, our Partnership Agreement permits the General Partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as the General Partner, free of any duties to us and our shareholders. This provision entitles the General Partner and its affiliates to consider only the interests and factors that it desires and relieves it of any duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or our shareholders. Examples of decisions that the General Partner and its affiliates may make in their individual capacities include:\n\u2022\nhow to allocate corporate opportunities among us and its affiliates;\n\u2022\nwhether to exercise its limited call right, preemptive rights or registration rights;\n\u2022\nwhether to seek approval of the resolution of a conflict of interest by the Conflicts Committee;\n\u2022\nhow to exercise its voting rights with respect to the units it or its affiliates own in OpCo and us;\n\u2022\nwhether to exchange its OpCo common units for our Class A shares; and\n\u2022\nwhether to consent to any merger, consolidation or conversion of us or OpCo or to an amendment to our Partnership Agreement or the OpCo limited liability company agreement.\nThese decisions may be made by the owner of the General Partner. Holdings, which is owned by our Sponsors, is the owner of the General Partner.\nBy purchasing a Class A share, a Class A shareholder becomes bound by the provisions in our Partnership Agreement, including the provisions discussed above.\nThe General Partner interest or the control of the General Partner may be transferred to a third party without shareholder consent.\nOur Partnership Agreement does not restrict the ability of Holdings to transfer all or a portion of its ownership interest in the General Partner to a third party. The new owner of the General Partner would then be in a position to replace the Board with its own designees and thereby exert significant control over the decisions made by the board of directors and officers.\nThe incentive distribution rights of our Sponsors, through Holdings, may be transferred to a third party without shareholder consent.\nOur Sponsors may cause Holdings to transfer its incentive distribution rights to a third party at any time without the consent of our shareholders. If our Sponsors transfer their incentive distribution rights to a third party, they will have less incentive to support an increase in our distributions. A transfer of incentive distribution rights by our Sponsors could reduce the likelihood of First Solar or SunPower selling or contributing additional solar energy projects to us, which in turn would impact our ability to grow our portfolio.\nOur Sponsors, through Holdings, or any transferee holding a majority of the incentive distribution rights, may elect to cause OpCo to issue common units to Holdings in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to the incentive distribution rights, without the approval of the Conflicts Committee or our shareholders. This election may result in lower distributions to our Class A shareholders in certain situations.\nThe holder or holders of a majority of the incentive distribution rights, which is currently our Sponsors through Holdings, have the right, at any time when there are no OpCo subordinated units outstanding and the holders have received incentive distributions at the highest level to which they are entitled (200%) for each of the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters (and the aggregate amounts distributed in respect of such four-quarter period did not exceed adjusted operating surplus for such four-quarter period), to reset the minimum quarterly distribution and the initial target distribution levels at higher levels based on our cash distribution at the time of the exercise of the reset election. Following a reset election, the minimum quarterly distribution will be reset to an amount equal to the average cash distribution per unit for the two fiscal quarters immediately preceding the reset election (such amount is referred to as the \u201creset minimum quarterly distribution\u201d), and the target distribution levels will be reset to correspondingly higher levels based on percentage increases above the reset minimum quarterly distribution. Our Sponsors have the right to transfer the incentive distribution rights at any time, in whole or in part, and any transferee holding a majority of the incentive distribution rights shall have the same rights as our Sponsors with respect to resetting target distributions.\nIn the event of a reset of the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels, the holders of the incentive distribution rights will be entitled to receive, in the aggregate, the number of OpCo\u2019s common units equal to that number of OpCo common units which would have entitled the holders to an average aggregate quarterly cash distribution in the prior two quarters equal to the average of the distributions on the incentive distribution rights in the prior two quarters. We anticipate that the General Partner would exercise this reset right in order to facilitate acquisitions or internal expansion projects that would not otherwise be sufficiently accretive to cash distributions per OpCo common unit. It is possible, however, that our Sponsors or a transferee could exercise this reset election at a time when it is experiencing, or expects to experience, declines in the cash distributions it receives related to its incentive distribution rights and may therefore desire to be issued OpCo common units rather than retain the right to receive incentive distribution payments based on target distribution levels that are less certain to be achieved in the then-current business environment. This risk could be elevated if our incentive distribution rights have been transferred to a third party. As a result, a reset election may cause our Class A shareholders to experience reduction in the amount of cash distributions that they would have otherwise received had we not issued Class A shares to the General Partner in connection with resetting the target distribution levels.\nEven if holders of our Class A shares are dissatisfied, they cannot initially remove the General Partner without its consent.\nShareholders will be unable initially to remove the General Partner or OpCo\u2019s managing member without its consent because the General Partner and its affiliates own sufficient shares to be able to prevent its removal. The vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of all outstanding shares (including shares owned by the General Partner and its affiliates, including our Sponsors) is required to remove the General Partner. As of November 30, 2017, the General Partner and its affiliates, including our Sponsors, owned 64.5% of our outstanding shares through their ownership of Class B shares. In addition, any vote to remove the General Partner during the subordination period must provide for the election of a successor general partner by the holders of a majority of the Class A shares and a majority of the Class B shares, voting as separate classes. This provides Holdings the ability to prevent the removal of the General Partner.\nFurthermore, shareholders\u2019 voting rights are further restricted by our Partnership Agreement provision providing that any shares held by a person that owns 20% or more of any class of shares then outstanding, other than the General Partner, its affiliates, their transferees and persons who acquired such shares with the prior approval of the Board, cannot vote on any matter.\nOur Partnership Agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of shareholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting the shareholders\u2019 ability to influence the manner or direction of management.\nWe may issue additional Class A shares or other partnership interests without shareholder approval, which would dilute shareholder interests.\nAt any time, we may issue an unlimited number of limited partner interests of any type without the approval of our shareholders, and our shareholders (other than our Sponsors and their affiliates) have no preemptive or other rights (solely as a result of their status as shareholders) to purchase any such limited partner interests. Further, there are no limitations in our Partnership Agreement on our ability to issue equity securities that rank equal or senior to our Class A shares as to distributions or in liquidation or that have special voting rights and other rights. The issuance by us of additional Class A shares or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:\n\u2022\nour existing shareholders\u2019 proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash we have available to distribute on each Class A share may decrease;\n\u2022\nbecause a lower percentage of total outstanding OpCo units will be OpCo subordinated units, the risk that a shortfall in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution will be borne by OpCo\u2019s common unitholders, including the Partnership, will increase;\n\u2022\nthe ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase;\n\u2022\nthe relative voting strength of each previously outstanding share may be diminished; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of our Class A shares may decline.\nThe market price of our Class A Shares could be adversely affected by sales of substantial amounts of our Class A Shares in the public or private markets, including sales by our Sponsors, including upon conversion of the OpCo subordinated units.\nOur Sponsors collectively own 15,500,000 OpCo common units that can be exchanged for 15,500,000 Class A Shares and sold into the public market at any time. In addition, the subordination period could end as soon as the first business day after the distribution with respect to the quarter ending August 31, 2018, at which time the 35,500,000 OpCo subordinated units owned by our Sponsors will automatically convert into 35,500,000 OpCo common units and be eligible to be exchanged for 35,500,000 Class A Shares as well. Sales by our Sponsors of a substantial number of our Class A Shares in the public or private markets at any time, including upon the end of the subordination period, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our Class A Shares or could impair our ability to obtain capital through an offering of equity securities. Our Sponsors have registration rights relating to the offer and sale of any Class A shares that they hold, which would facilitate the disposition of large blocks of Class A Shares.\nThe General Partner has a limited call right that may require you to sell your Class A shares at an undesirable time or price.\nIf at any time the General Partner and its affiliates, including our Sponsors, own more than 80% of the aggregate of the number of Class A shares then outstanding and the number of Class B shares equal to the number of OpCo common units owned by the Sponsors and their affiliates, the General Partner will have the right, but not the obligation, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the Class A shares held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than their then-current market price, as calculated pursuant to the terms of our Partnership Agreement. As a result, you may be required to sell your Class A shares at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on your investment. You may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of your shares. At November 30, 2017, the General Partner and its affiliates own approximately 64.5% of our outstanding shares through their ownership of Class B shares. At the end of the subordination period, assuming no additional issuances of Class A shares by us, the General Partner and its affiliates will own OpCo common units convertible into approximately 64.5% of our outstanding Class A shares and therefore would not be able to exercise the call right at that time.\nReimbursements and fees owed to the General Partner and its affiliates for services provided to us or on our behalf will reduce cash available for distribution. The amount and timing of such reimbursements and fees will be determined by the General Partner and there are no limits on the amount that OpCo may be required to pay.\nUnder the OpCo limited liability company agreement, prior to making any distributions on OpCo\u2019s common units, OpCo will reimburse the General Partner and its affiliates, including the Partnership, for out-of-pocket expenses they incur and payments they make on our behalf. OpCo will also pay certain fees and reimbursements under the MSAs prior to making any distributions on OpCo\u2019s common units. The reimbursement of expenses and certain payments made under credit support arrangements and payment of fees, if any, to the General Partner and its affiliates will reduce the amount of available cash OpCo has to pay cash distributions to us and the amount that we have available to pay distributions to our Class A shareholders. Under the OpCo limited liability company agreement, there is no limit on the fees and expense reimbursements OpCo may be required to pay.\nThe General Partner\u2019s discretion in establishing cash reserves may reduce the amount of available cash.\nThe OpCo limited liability company agreement requires OpCo\u2019s managing member to deduct from operating surplus cash reserves that it determines are necessary to fund future operating expenditures. In addition, our Partnership Agreement and the OpCo limited liability company agreement permit the General Partner to reduce available cash by establishing cash reserves for the proper conduct of business, to comply with applicable law or agreements to which we or our subsidiaries are a party or to provide funds for future distributions to OpCo\u2019s members and our partners. These cash reserves will affect the amount of cash distributed by OpCo and the amount of cash available for distribution to our Class A shareholders.\nWe and OpCo can borrow money to pay distributions, which would reduce the amount of credit available to operate our business.\nThe OpCo limited liability company agreement allows us to make working capital borrowings to pay distributions to our Class A shareholders or OpCo\u2019s unitholders. Accordingly, if we or OpCo have available borrowing capacity, we or OpCo can make distributions on our Class A shares or OpCo\u2019s common and subordinated units, as applicable, even though cash generated by our operations may not be sufficient to pay such distributions. Any working capital borrowings by us or OpCo to make distributions will reduce the amount of working capital borrowings we or OpCo can make for operations.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely impact the price of our Class A shares, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and our ability to make cash distributions at our intended levels.\nInterest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. As with other yield-oriented securities, our share price is impacted by our level of our cash distributions and implied distribution yield. The distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our shares, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on the price of our Class A shares, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and our ability to make cash distributions at our intended levels.\nExcept in limited circumstances, the General Partner has the power and authority to conduct our business without shareholder approval.\nUnder our Partnership Agreement, the General Partner has full power and authority to do all things, other than those items that require shareholder approval or with respect to which the General Partner has sought Conflicts Committee approval, on such terms as it determines to be necessary or appropriate to conduct our business. In addition, since we are the managing member of OpCo, determinations made by us under the OpCo limited liability company agreement will be made at the direction of the General Partner. Decisions that may be made by the General Partner in accordance with our Partnership Agreement or the OpCo limited liability company agreement include:\n\u2022\nmaking any expenditures, lending or borrowing money, assuming, guaranteeing or contracting for indebtedness and other liabilities, issuing evidences of indebtedness, including indebtedness that is convertible into our securities, and incurring any other obligations;\n\u2022\npurchasing, selling, acquiring or disposing of our securities, or issuing additional options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to our securities;\n\u2022\nacquiring, disposing, mortgaging, pledging, encumbering, hypothecating or exchanging any or all of our assets;\n\u2022\nnegotiating, executing and performing any contracts, conveyances or other instruments;\n\u2022\nmaking cash distributions;\n\u2022\nselecting and dismissing employees and agents, outside attorneys, accountants, consultants and contractors and determining their compensation and other terms of employment or hiring;\n\u2022\nmaintaining insurance for our or OpCo\u2019s benefit and the benefit of our respective partners;\n\u2022\nforming, acquiring an interest in, contributing property to and making loans to any limited or general partnership, joint venture, corporation, limited liability company or other entity;\n\u2022\ncontrolling any matters affecting our rights and obligations, including bringing and defending of actions at law or in equity, otherwise engaging in the conduct of litigation, arbitration or mediation, incurring legal expenses and settling claims and litigation;\n\u2022\nindemnifying any person against liabilities and contingencies to the extent permitted by law;\n\u2022\nmaking tax, regulatory and other filings or rendering periodic or other reports to governmental or other agencies having jurisdiction over our business or assets; and\n\u2022\nentering into and terminating agreements with any of its affiliates to render services to us or to itself in the discharge of its duties as the General Partner.\nOur Partnership Agreement provides that the General Partner must act in good faith when making decisions on our behalf, and our Partnership Agreement further provides that in order for a determination to be made in good faith, the General Partner must subjectively believe that the determination is in, or not adverse to, the best interests of our partnership.\nContracts between us, on the one hand, and the General Partner and its affiliates, on the other hand, may not be the result of arm\u2019s-length negotiations.\nOur Partnership Agreement allows the General Partner to determine, in good faith, any amounts to pay itself or its affiliates for any services rendered to us. The General Partner may also enter into additional contractual arrangements with any of its affiliates on our behalf. The General Partner will determine in good faith the terms of any arrangement or transaction entered into by the Partnership. Similarly, agreements, contracts or arrangements between us and the General Partner and its affiliates that are entered into by the Partnership will not be required to be negotiated on an arm\u2019s-length basis, although, in some circumstances, the General Partner may determine that the Conflicts Committee may make a determination on our behalf with respect to such arrangements.\nThe General Partner and its affiliates have no obligation to permit us to use any assets or services of the General Partner and its affiliates, except as may be provided in contracts entered into specifically for such use. There is no obligation of the General Partner and its affiliates to enter into any contracts of this kind.\nClass A shareholders have no right to enforce the obligations of the General Partner and its affiliates under agreements with us.\nAny agreements between us, on the one hand, and the General Partner and its affiliates, on the other hand, do not, and in the future will not, grant to the shareholders, separate and apart from us, the right to enforce the obligations of the General Partner and its affiliates in our favor.\nThe General Partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us.\nThe attorneys, independent accountants and others who perform services for us are retained by the General Partner. Attorneys, independent accountants and others who perform services for us are selected by the General Partner or our Conflicts Committee and may perform services for the General Partner and its affiliates. We may retain separate counsel for ourselves or the holders of shares in the event of a conflict of interest between the General Partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us or the holders of shares, on the other, depending on the nature of the conflict. We do not intend to do so in most cases.\nFor so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain requirements that apply to other public companies.\nFor as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the Jumpstart Our Business Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies\nthat are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to provide an auditor\u2019s attestation report on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports. We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if we have more than $1.1 billion of revenues in a fiscal year, have more than $700 million in market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nTo the extent that we rely on any of the exemptions available to emerging growth companies, our Class A shareholders will receive less information about our executive compensation and internal control over financial reporting than issuers that are not emerging growth companies. If some investors find our Class A shares to be less attractive as a result, the trading price of our Class A shares may decline.\nShareholders may have to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them.\nUnder certain circumstances, shareholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully distributed to them. Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, we may not make a distribution to our shareholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount. Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interest and liabilities that are non-recourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.\nWhile we believe we currently have effective internal control over financial reporting, we may identify a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting that could cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and result in a decrease in the value of our Class A shares.\nOur management is responsible for maintaining internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nWe need to continuously maintain our internal control processes and systems and adapt them as our business grows and changes. This process is expensive, time-consuming and requires significant management attention. We cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Furthermore, as we grow our business or acquire other businesses, our internal controls may become more complex and we may require significantly more resources to ensure they remain effective. Failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, either in our existing business or in businesses that we may acquire, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and the trading price of our Class A shares may decline.\nRemediation of a material weakness could require us to incur significant expense and if we fail to remedy any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, the trading price of our Class A shares may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, including the SEC or the NASDAQ. We may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods.\nThe NASDAQ does not require a publicly traded partnership like us to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements.\nBecause we are a publicly traded limited partnership, the NASDAQ does not require us, and we do not have, a majority of independent directors on the Board or a compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee. Additionally, any future issuance of additional partnership interests, including to affiliates, will not be subject to the NASDAQ\u2019s shareholder approval rules that apply to a corporation. Accordingly, shareholders will not have the same protections afforded to certain corporations that are subject to all of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nOur future tax liability may be greater than expected if we do not generate NOLs sufficient to offset taxable income or if tax authorities challenge certain of our tax positions.\nEven though we are organized as a limited partnership under state law, we are treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and thus are subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on our net taxable income. We expect to generate NOLs and NOL carryforwards that we can use to offset future taxable income. As a result, we do not expect to pay meaningful U.S. federal income tax for approximately ten years. This estimate is based upon assumptions we have made regarding, among other things, OpCo\u2019s income, capital expenditures and operating expenses and it ignores the effect of any possible acquisitions of additional assets, including the SunPower ROFO Projects. While we expect that our NOLs and NOL carryforwards will be available to us as a future benefit, in the event that they are not generated as expected, are successfully challenged by the IRS (in a tax audit or otherwise), or are subject to future limitations as described below, our ability to realize these benefits may be limited. Further, the IRS or other tax authorities could challenge one or more tax positions we or OpCo take, such as the classification of assets under the income tax depreciation rules, the characterization of expenses for income tax purposes, the extent to which sales, use or goods and services tax applies to operations in a particular state or the availability of property tax exemptions with respect to our projects, which could reduce the NOLs we generate. Further, any change in law may affect our tax position, including the size of our expected NOLs.\nOur federal and state tax positions may be challenged by the relevant tax authority. The process and costs, including potential penalties for nonpayment of disputed amounts, of contesting such challenges, administratively or judicially, regardless of the merits, could be material. A reduction in our expected NOLs and NOL carryforwards, a limitation on our ability to use such losses, or other tax attributes, such as tax credits, and future tax audits or a challenge by tax authorities to our tax positions may result in a material increase in our estimated future income or other tax liabilities, which would negatively impact the amount of after-tax cash available for distribution to our Class A shareholders and our financial condition.\nOur ability to use NOLs and NOL carryforwards to offset future income may be limited.\nOur ability to use any NOLs generated by us could be substantially limited if we were to experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Code. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d would occur if our \u201c5-percent shareholders,\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Code, including certain groups of persons treated as \u201c5-percent shareholders,\u201d collectively increased their ownership in us by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. An ownership change can occur as a result of a public offering of our Class A shares, as well as through secondary market purchases of our Class A shares and certain types of reorganization transactions. A corporation (including any entity that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that experiences an ownership change will generally be subject to an annual limitation on the use of its pre-ownership change NOLs and NOL carryforwards (and certain other losses and/or credits) equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the \u201clong-term tax-exempt rate\u201d (as determined by the IRS) for the month in which the ownership change occurs. Such a limitation could, for any given year, have the effect of increasing the amount of our U.S. federal income tax liability, which would negatively impact the amount of after-tax cash available for distribution to our Class A shareholders and our financial condition.\nOur ability to use any NOLs generated by us could also be substantially limited by changes in U.S. federal tax law.\nDistributions to Class A shareholders may be taxable as dividends.\nEven though we are organized as a limited partnership under state law, we are treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, if we make distributions from current or accumulated earnings and profits as computed for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such distributions will generally be taxable to Class A shareholders as ordinary dividend income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Distributions paid to non-corporate U.S. shareholders will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates, provided that certain holding period and other requirements are satisfied. We estimate that we will have limited earnings and profits for eight or more years. However, it is difficult to predict whether we will generate earnings and profits as computed for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any given tax year, and although we expect that a portion of our distributions to Class A shareholders will exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits as computed for U.S. federal income tax purposes and therefore constitute a non-taxable return of capital distribution to the extent of a shareholder\u2019s basis in its Class A shares, this may not occur. In addition, although return-of-capital distributions are generally non-taxable to the extent of a shareholder\u2019s basis in its Class A shares, such distributions will reduce the shareholder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its Class A shares, which will result in an increase in the amount of gain (or a decrease in the amount of loss) that will be recognized by the shareholder on a future disposition of our Class A shares, and to the extent any return-of-\ncapital distribution exceeds a shareholder\u2019s basis, such distributions will be treated as gain on the sale or exchange of the Class A shares.\nChanges in ownership outside our control may increase property tax exposure.\nA subsidiary of Southern Company owns a 51% economic interest in, and we own a 49% economic interest in, each of the Henrietta Project Entity, the Lost Hills Blackwell Project Entity, the North Star Project Entity and the Solar Gen 2 Project Entity. In addition, a subsidiary of Southern Company owns a 66% economic interest in, and we own a 34% economic interest in, the Stateline Project Entity. Collectively, these five project entities in which we own minority interests constitute over 68% of the MW of the projects in our portfolio of solar assets as of November 30, 2017.\nThe assets of each of these five joint venture projects are all located in California, which exempts active solar power systems from state and local property taxes. However, California\u2019s property tax exemption for these projects will terminate if there is a direct or indirect change in ownership of the systems. As a result of our minority interest, we cannot prevent a change in ownership in these project entities if Southern Company sells its controlling interest to a third party. Exposure to California state and local property taxes would negatively impact the amount of after-tax cash available for distribution to our Class A shareholders and our financial condition.", "PERMNO": 15415, "SIC": 4991, "TIC": "CAFD"}
