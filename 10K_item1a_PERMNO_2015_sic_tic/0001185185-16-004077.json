{"cik": "1236275", "company": "SilverSun Technologies, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nWe have a large accumulated deficit, may incur future losses and may be unable to maintain profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $10,642,172 and $11,016,477, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 we had stockholders' equity of $1,556,321 and $13,607 respectively. We may incur net losses in the future. Our ability to achieve and sustain long-term profitability is largely dependent on our ability to successfully market and sell our products and services, control our costs, and effectively manage our growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain profitability. In the event we fail to maintain profitability, our stock price could decline.\nWe cannot accurately forecast our future revenues and operating results, which may fluctuate.\nOur operating history and the rapidly changing nature of the markets in which we compete make it difficult to accurately forecast our revenues and operating results. Furthermore, we expect our revenues and operating results to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe timing of sales of our products and services;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of product implementation, particularly large design projects;\n\u00b7\nunexpected delays in introducing new products and services;\n\u00b7\nincreased expenses, whether related to sales and marketing, product development, or administration;\n\u00b7\nthe mix of product license and services revenue; and\n\u00b7\ncosts related to possible acquisitions of technology or businesses.\nWe may fail to develop new products, or may incur unexpected expenses or delays.\nAlthough we currently have fully developed products available for sale, we may need to develop various new technologies, products and product features and to remain competitive. Due to the risks inherent in developing new products and technologies - limited financing, loss of key personnel, and other factors - we may fail to develop these technologies and products, or may experience lengthy and costly delays in doing so. Although we are able to license some of our technologies in their current stage of development, we cannot assure that we will be able to develop new products or enhancements to our existing products in order to remain competitive.\nWe may need additional financing which we may not be able to obtain on acceptable terms. If we are unable to raise additional capital, as needed, the future growth of our business and operations could be severely limited.\nA limiting factor on our growth is our limited capitalization, which could impact our ability to execute on our business plan. If we raise additional capital through the issuance of debt, this will result in increased interest expense. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of the Company held by existing shareholders will be reduced and our shareholders may experience significant dilution. In addition, new securities may contain rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of our Common Stock. If additional funds are raised by the issuance of debt or other equity instruments, we may become subject to certain operational limitations (for example, negative operating covenants). There can be no assurance that acceptable financing necessary to further implement our business plan can be obtained on suitable terms, if at all. Our ability to develop our business, fund expansion, develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures, could suffer if we are unable to raise the additional funds on acceptable terms, which would have the effect of limiting our ability to increase our revenues or possibly attain profitable operations in the future.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or to reduce probability of fraud occurrence. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our reputation and adversely impact the trading price of our Common Stock.\nEffective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. We may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed.\nOur evaluations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act the Company concluded that the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective due to our limited finance staff and corresponding segregation of duties, and the ineffective management review of complex transactions included in the consolidated financial statements, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management is composed of a small number of individuals resulting in a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist. In order to remedy this situation we would need to hire additional staff. Currently, we are unable to allocate the necessary resources to hire additional staff and to facilitate greater segregation of duties. However, we will reassess our resources capabilities and priorities in the following year and evaluate the cost-benefit relationship of possible changes in our controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.\nManagement believes that the material weaknesses are the result of the lack of scale of our operations and are intrinsic to our small size. Nonetheless, our small size and our current internal control deficiencies may have a material adverse effect on our ability to accurately and timely report our financial information which, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. This could result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could negatively impact the price of our Common Stock as well as our access to additional capital.\nWe may fail to recruit and retain qualified personnel.\nWe expect to rapidly expand our operations and grow our sales, development and administrative operations. Accordingly, recruiting and retaining such personnel in the future will be critical to our success. There is intense competition from other companies for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities, particularly sales, marketing and managed services. If we fail to identify, attract, retain and motivate these highly skilled personnel, we may be unable to continue our marketing and managed services activities and service our clients\u2019 needs, and this could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nIf our technologies and products contain defects or otherwise do not work as expected, we may incur significant expenses in attempting to correct these defects or in defending lawsuits over any such defects.\nSoftware products are not currently accurate in every instance, and may never be. Furthermore, we could inadvertently release products and technologies that contain defects. In addition, third-party technology that we include in our products could contain defects. We may incur significant expenses to correct such defects. Clients who are not satisfied with our products or services could bring claims against us for substantial damages. Such claims could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and, if successful, could result in the plaintiffs being awarded significant damages. Our payment of any such expenses or damages could prevent us from becoming profitable.\nOur success is highly dependent upon our ability to compete against competitors that have significantly greater resources than we have.\nThe ERP software, EDI software, MSP and business consulting industries are highly competitive, and we believe that this competition will intensify. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, product development and marketing resources, greater name recognition and larger client bases than we do. Our competitors could use these resources to market or develop products or services that are more effective or less costly than any or all of our products or services or that could render any or all of our products or services obsolete. Our competitors could also use their economic strength to influence the market to continue to buy their existing products.\nIf we are not able to protect our trade secrets through enforcement of our confidentiality and non-competition agreements, then we may not be able to compete effectively and we may not be profitable.\nWe attempt to protect our trade secrets, including the processes, concepts, ideas and documentation associated with our technologies, through the use of confidentiality agreements and non-competition agreements with our current employees and with other parties to whom we have divulged such trade secrets. If the employees or other parties breach our confidentiality agreements and non-competition agreements or if these agreements are not sufficient to protect our technology or are found to be unenforceable, our competitors could acquire and use information that we consider to be our trade secrets and we may not be able to compete effectively. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical and manufacturing resources than we have, and we may not be profitable if our competitors are also able to take advantage of our trade secrets.\nOur failure to secure trademark registrations could adversely affect our ability to market our product candidates and our business.\nOur trademark applications in the United States and any other jurisdictions where we may file may be denied, and we may not be able to maintain or enforce our registered trademarks. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, with respect to the United States Patent and Trademark Office and any corresponding foreign agencies, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our applications and/or registrations, and our applications and/or registrations may not survive such proceedings. Failure to secure such trademark registrations in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect our ability to market our product candidates and our business.\nWe may unintentionally infringe on the proprietary rights of others.\nMany lawsuits currently are being brought in the software industry alleging violation of intellectual property rights. Although we do not believe that we are infringing on any patent rights, patent holders may claim that we are doing so. Any such claim would likely be time-consuming and expensive to defend, particularly if we are unsuccessful, and could prevent us from selling our products or services. In addition, we may also be forced to enter into costly and burdensome royalty and licensing agreements.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid technological change and failure to adapt our product development to these changes may cause our products to become obsolete.\nWe participate in a highly dynamic industry characterized by rapid change and uncertainty relating to new and emerging technologies and markets. Future technology or market changes may cause some of our products to become obsolete more quickly than expected.\nThe trend toward consolidation in our industry may impede our ability to compete effectively.\nAs consolidation in the software industry continues, fewer companies dominate particular markets, changing the nature of the market and potentially providing consumers with fewer choices. Also, many of these companies offer a broader range of products than us, ranging from desktop to enterprise solutions. We may not be able to compete effectively against these competitors. Furthermore, we may use strategic acquisitions, as necessary, to acquire technology, people and products for our overall product strategy. The trend toward consolidation in our industry may result in increased competition in acquiring these technologies, people or products, resulting in increased acquisition costs or the inability to acquire the desired technologies, people or products. Any of these changes may have a significant adverse effect on our future revenues and operating results.\nWe face intense price-based competition for licensing of our products which could reduce profit margins.\nPrice competition is often intense in the software market. Price competition may continue to increase and become even more significant in the future, resulting in reduced profit margins.\nThe software and technology industry is highly competitive. If we cannot develop and market desirable products that the public is willing to purchase, we will not be able to compete successfully. Our business may be adversely affected and we may not be able to generate any revenues.\nWe have many potential competitors in the software industry. We consider the competition to be competent, experienced, and may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. Our ability to compete effectively may be adversely affected by the ability of these competitors to devote greater resources to the development, sales, and marketing of their products than are available to us. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors, also, offer a wider range of software products, have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases than the Company. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, customer desires, as well as undertake more extensive promotional activities, offer terms that are more attractive to customers and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than the Company. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to compete successfully against present or future competitors or that the competitive pressure we may encounter will not force us to cease operations.\nIf there are events or circumstances affecting the reliability or security of the internet, access to our website and/or the ability to safeguard confidential information could be impaired causing a negative effect on the financial results of our business operations.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our website infrastructure may be vulnerable to computer viruses, hacking or similar disruptive problems caused by members, other internet users, other connected internet sites, and the interconnecting telecommunications networks. Such problems caused by third-parties could lead to interruptions, delays or cessation of service to our customers. Inappropriate use of the internet by third-parties could also potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer system, which may deter individuals from becoming customers. Such inappropriate use of the internet includes attempting to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, which is commonly known as \u201ccracking\u201d or \u201chacking.\u201d Although we have implemented security measures, such measures have been circumvented in the past by hackers on other websites on the internet, although our networks have never been breached, and there can be no assurance that any measures we implement would not be circumvented in future. Dealing with problems caused by computer viruses or other inappropriate uses or security breaches may require interruptions, delays or cessation of service to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we lose the services of any of our key personnel, including Mark Meller and Jeffrey D. Roth, our business may suffer.\nWe are dependent on Mark Meller, our Chief Executive Officer and key employees in our operating subsidiary, specifically Jeffrey D. Roth, Chief Executive Officer of SWK. The loss of any of our key personnel could materially harm our business because of the cost and time necessary to retain and train a replacement. Such a loss would also divert management attention away from operational issues.\nTo service our debt obligations, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. Any failure to repay our outstanding indebtedness as it matures, could materially adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to satisfy our debt obligations and repay or refinance our maturing indebtedness will depend principally upon our future operating performance.\nAs a result, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, will affect our ability to make payments on our debt and comply with the covenants of the line of credit. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt service obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, incurring additional debt, issuing equity or convertible securities, utilizing our line of credit, reducing discretionary expenditures and selling certain assets (or combinations thereof). Our ability to execute such alternative financing plans will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. In addition, our ability to execute such alternative financing plans may be subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, including our revolving credit facility and our term loan. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants compared to those associated with any debt that is being refinanced, which could further restrict our business operations. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or our inability to refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related To Our Securities\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCBB and OTCQB, which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCBB and OTCQB. The quotation of our shares on the OTCBB and OTCQB may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future.\nThere is limited liquidity on the OTCBB and OTCQB, which enhances the volatile nature of our equity.\nWhen fewer shares of a security are being traded on the OTCBB and OTCQB, volatility of prices may increase and price movement may outpace the ability to deliver accurate quote information. Due to lower trading volumes in shares of our common stock, there may be a lower likelihood that orders for shares of our common stock will be executed, and current prices may differ significantly from the price that was quoted at the time of entry of the order.\nOur stock price is likely to be highly volatile because of our limited public float.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile because there has been a relatively thin trading market for our stock, which causes trades of small blocks of stock to have a significant impact on our stock price. You may not be able to resell shares of our common stock following periods of volatility because of the market\u2019s adverse reaction to volatility. Other factors that could cause such volatility may include, among other things: actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; the absence of securities analysts covering us and distributing research and recommendations about us; overall stock market fluctuations; economic conditions generally; announcements concerning our business or those of our competitors; our ability to raise capital when we require it, and to raise such capital on favorable terms; conditions or trends in the industry; litigation; changes in market valuations of other similar companies; announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures; future sales of common stock; actions initiated by the SEC or other regulatory bodies; and general market conditions. Any of these factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nIn order to raise sufficient funds to expand our operations, we may have to issue additional securities at prices which may result in substantial dilution to our shareholders.\nIf we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt, our current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership will be reduced. In addition, these transactions may dilute the value of our common shares outstanding. We may also have to issue securities that may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock.\nOur stock is thinly traded, so you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all.\nThe shares of our common stock are traded on the OTCBB and OTCQB and are thinly traded, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common stock at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a smaller reporting company that is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community who generate or influence sales volume. Even in the event that we come to the attention of such persons, they would likely be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we become more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, our stock price may not reflect an actual or perceived value. Also, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as is currently the case, as compared to a seasoned issuer that has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. A broader or more active public trading market for our common shares may not develop or if developed, may not be sustained. Due to these conditions, you may not be able to sell your shares at or near ask prices or at all if you need money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.\nCurrently, there is a limited public market for our securities, and there can be no assurances that any public market will ever develop and, even if developed, it is likely to be subject to significant price fluctuations.\nWe have a trading symbol for our common stock, namely \u2018SSNT\u2019. However, our stock has been thinly traded. Consequently, there can be no assurances as to whether:\n\u00b7\nany substantial market for our shares will develop;\n\u00b7\nthe prices at which our common stock will trade; or\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which investor interest in us will lead to the development of an active, liquid trading market. Active trading markets generally result in lower price volatility and more efficient execution of buy and sell orders for investors.\nUntil our common stock is fully distributed and an orderly market develops in our common stock, if ever, the price at which it trades is likely to fluctuate significantly. Prices for our common stock will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors, including the depth and liquidity of the market for shares of our common stock, developments affecting our business, including the impact of the factors referred to elsewhere in these risk factors, investor perception of our Company and general economic and market conditions. No assurances can be given that an orderly or liquid market will ever develop for the shares of our common stock.\nWe are subject to the penny stock rules which will make our securities more difficult to sell.\nWe are subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules because our securities sell below $5.00 per share. The penny stock rules require broker-dealers to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. In addition, the bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to completing the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation.\nFurthermore, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction, the broker dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. The penny stock rules are burdensome and may reduce purchases of any offerings and reduce the trading activity for our securities. As long as our securities are subject to the penny stock rules, the holders of such securities will find it more difficult to sell their securities.", "PERMNO": 16680, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "SSNT"}
