Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. Listed below, not necessarily in order of importance or probability of occurrence, are the most significant risk factors applicable to us. Additionally, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified. See \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe may be unable to effectively manage our rapid growth or achieve anticipated growth, which could place significant strain on our management personnel, systems and resources.\nWe have experienced rapid growth and significantly expanded our business over the past several years, both organically and through strategic acquisitions. Our rapid growth has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Continued expansion increases the challenges we face in:\n\u2022\nrecruiting, training and retaining sufficiently skilled professionals and management personnel;\n\u2022\nadhering to and further improving our high-quality process execution standards and maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction;\n\u2022\nmanaging a larger number of customers in a greater number of industries and locations;\n\u2022\nmaintaining effective oversight of personnel and delivery centers;\n\u2022\ncoordinating effectively across geographies and business units to execute our strategic plan; and\n\u2022\ndeveloping and improving our internal administrative, operational and financial infrastructure.\nMoreover, we intend to continue our expansion for the foreseeable future and pursue available opportunities. As we introduce new services or enter into new markets, we may face new market, technological, operational, compliance and administrative risks and challenges. As a result of these and other challenges associated with expansion, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated growth and our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur failure to successfully attract, hire, train and retain new personnel with the qualifications necessary to fulfill the needs of our existing and future customers could materially adversely affect our ability to provide high quality services to those customers.\nThe ability to hire and retain highly skilled information technology professionals, including project managers, IT engineers and other technical personnel, is critical to our success. To maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business, we must attract, hire, train and retain personnel with diverse skill sets and competencies, including those with management experience, across the geographically diverse locations in which we operate. Competition for highly skilled professionals is intense in the markets where we operate, and we may experience significant employee turnover rates due to such competition. If we are unable to attract, hire, train or retain highly skilled personnel, our ability to meet and develop ongoing and future business could be jeopardized and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA significant increase in the attrition rate among professionals with specialized skills could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity and could lead to a decline in demand for our services. In addition, any reductions in headcount for economic or business reasons, however temporary, could negatively affect our reputation as an employer, and our ability to hire personnel to meet our business requirements may suffer.\nIncreases in wages for our people and other compensation expense could prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and result in dilution to our stockholders.\nWage costs for industry professionals in the emerging markets in which we have significant operations and delivery centers are lower than comparable wage costs in more developed countries. However, wage costs in the service industry in these countries may increase at a faster rate than in the past, which ultimately may make us less competitive unless we are able to increase the efficiency and productivity of our people. Wage inflation may also increase our cost of providing services and reduce our profitability.\nAdditionally, we have granted certain equity-based awards under our stock incentive plans and entered into other stock-based compensation arrangements in the past, and expect to continue this practice. The expenses associated with stock-based compensation may reduce the attractiveness to us of issuing equity awards under our equity incentive plan. However, if we do not grant equity awards, or if we reduce the value of equity awards we grant, we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel. If we grant more equity awards to attract and retain key personnel, the expenses associated with such additional equity awards could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, any new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish our use and the value of our equity-based awards. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage or cause us to consider changes to our pay structure. The issuance of equity-based compensation also results in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nOur success depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior executives and other key personnel, and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services.\nOur future success heavily depends upon the continued services of our senior executives and other key employees. If one or more of our senior executives or key employees are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, it could disrupt our business operations, and we may not be able to replace them easily or at all. In addition, competition for senior executives and key personnel in our industry is intense, and we may be unable to retain our senior executives and key personnel or attract and retain new senior executives and key personnel in the future, in which case our business may be severely disrupted. If any of our senior executives or key personnel, such as business development managers, joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose customers, suppliers, know-how and key personnel to them.\nOur profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our resource utilization and productivity levels.\nOur profitability is significantly impacted by our utilization and productivity levels of fixed-cost resources, such as our professionals as well as other resources such as computers and office space. Our ability to manage our utilization levels depends significantly on our ability to hire and train high-performing professionals, to plan effectively for future needs, to staff projects appropriately, and on the general economy and its effect on our customers and their business decisions regarding the use of our services. If we experience a slowdown or stoppage of work for any customer or on any project for which we have dedicated personnel or facilities, we may not be able to reallocate these assets to other customers and projects to keep their utilization and productivity levels high. If we are not able to maintain optimal resource utilization levels without corresponding cost reductions or price increases, our profitability will suffer.\nOur global business exposes us to operational and economic risks.\nWe are a global company with substantial international operations. The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks.\nRisks inherent in conducting international operations include:\n\u2022\nforeign exchange fluctuations;\n\u2022\napplication and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or export, including tariffs, quotas and other trade protection measures;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing intellectual property and/or contractual rights;\n\u2022\ncomplying with a wide variety of foreign laws;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\ncompetition from companies with more experience in a particular country or with international operations; and\n\u2022\noverall foreign policy and variability of foreign economic conditions.\nOur global operations are conducted predominantly in U.S. dollars, however we generate a significant portion of our revenues and incur expenditures in various currencies other than U.S. dollars. The majority of our customers are in North America and Western Europe, while most of our personnel and delivery centers are located in lower cost locations. These factors expose us to foreign exchange risks relating to revenues, compensation, purchases, capital expenditures, receivables and other balance-sheet items. As we continue to leverage our global delivery model, a larger portion of our revenues and incurred expenses may be in currency other than U.S. dollars. In some countries, we may be subject to regulatory or practical restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies, which would limit our ability to use cash across our global operations and increase our exposure to currency fluctuations. This risk could increase as we continue expanding our global operations, which may include entering emerging markets that may be more likely to impose these types of restrictions. Currency exchange volatility caused by political or economic instability or other factors, could also materially impact our results. See \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nOur industry is sensitive to the economic environment and the industry tends to decline during general economic downturns. Given our significant revenues from North America and Europe, if those economies weaken or slow, pricing for our services may be depressed and our customers may reduce or postpone their technology related spending significantly, which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability.\nWar, terrorism, other acts of violence or natural or manmade disasters may affect the markets in which we operate, our customers, and our service delivery.\nOur business may be negatively affected by instability, disruption or destruction in a geographic region in which we operate, regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest; and natural or manmade disasters, including famine, flood, fire, earthquake, storm or disease. Such events may cause customers to delay their decisions on spending for the services we provide and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles. These events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world, whether the facilities are ours or those of our customers, which could materially adversely affect our financial results. By disrupting communications and travel, giving rise to travel restrictions, and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly-skilled and qualified professionals, these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our customers. Travel restrictions could cause us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled personnel we need for our operations. In addition, any extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network services at our facilities, as well as system failures at, or security breaches in, our facilities or systems, could also adversely affect our ability to serve our customers.\nEmerging markets are subject to greater risks than more developed markets, including significant legal, economic, tax and political risks.\nWe have significant operations in certain emerging market economies in Eastern Europe, India and other Asian countries. Emerging markets are vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns elsewhere in the world and are subject to greater risks than more developed markets, including those that may result from foreign laws and regulations, the potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions or sanctions, tax increases, fluctuations in exchange rates, inflation, unstable political and military situations, labor issues, and less established legal systems. The economies of certain countries where we operate have experienced periods of considerable instability and have been subject to abrupt downturns. Such economic instability and any future deterioration in the international economic situation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\nContinuing military activities in Ukraine have combined with Ukraine\u2019s weak economic conditions to fuel ongoing economic uncertainty in Ukraine, Russia and other markets. The European Union, United States and other nations have imposed, and may continue imposing, further economic sanctions, including specific sanctions on certain Russian entities (specifically in the energy, defense and financial sectors). Prolonged political instability in Ukraine, sanctions against Russia and Russia\u2019s potential response to such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We have delivery centers in Ukraine employing 5,836 billable professionals as of December 31, 2018, none of which is located in the most volatile regions of Eastern Ukraine. We also have delivery centers in Russia, employing 4,438 billable professionals as of December 31, 2018 located in various cities including Moscow and St. Petersburg. To date we have not experienced any interruption in our office infrastructure, utility supply or internet connectivity needed to support our customers. We continue to monitor the situation closely. Our contingency plans include relocating work and/or personnel to other locations and adding new locations, as appropriate.\nThe U.S. Congress and Trump administration may make substantial changes to fiscal, political, regulatory and other federal policies that may adversely affect our business, and financial results.\nChanges in general economic or political conditions in the United States or other regions could adversely affect our business. For example, the administration under President Donald Trump has put forth and may continue to propose significant changes with respect to a variety of issues, including international trade agreements, import and export regulations, tariffs and customs duties, foreign relations, immigration laws, and corporate governance laws, that could have a positive or negative impact on our business.\nWe do not have long-term commitments from our customers, and our customers may terminate contracts before completion or choose not to renew contracts. A loss of business from significant customers could materially affect our results of operations.\nOur ability to maintain continuing relationships with our major customers is essential to the growth and profitability of our business. However, the volume of work performed for any specific customer is likely to vary from year to year, especially since we generally are not our customers\u2019 exclusive IT services provider and we generally do not have long-term commitments from customers to purchase our services. The ability of our customers to terminate engagements with or without cause makes our future revenues uncertain. Although a substantial majority of our revenues are generated from customers who also contributed to our revenues during the prior year, our engagements with our customers are typically for projects that are singular in nature. Therefore, we must seek to obtain new engagements when our current engagements end.\nThere are a number of factors relating to our customers that are outside of our control, which might lead them to terminate a contract or project with us, including:\n\u2022\nfinancial difficulties;\n\u2022\ncorporate restructuring, or mergers and acquisitions activity;\n\u2022\nchange in strategic priorities, resulting in elimination of the impetus for the project or a reduced level of technology related spending;\n\u2022\nchange in outsourcing strategy resulting in moving more work to the customer\u2019s in-house technology departments or to our competitors; and\n\u2022\nreplacement of existing software with packaged software supported by licensors.\nTermination or non-renewal of a customer contract could cause us to experience a higher than expected number of unassigned employees and thus compress our margins until we are able to reallocate our headcount. The loss of any of our major customers, or a significant decrease in the volume of work they outsource to us or the price at which we sell our services to them, if not replaced by new service engagements, could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nOur revenues are highly dependent on a limited number of industries, and any decrease in demand for outsourced services in these industries could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our customers is concentrated in five specific industry verticals: Financial Services; Software & Hi-Tech; Business Information & Media; Travel & Consumer; and Life Sciences & Healthcare. Our business growth largely depends on continued demand for our services from customers in these five industry verticals and other industries that we may target in the future, as well as on trends in these industries to outsource the type of services we provide.\nA downturn in any of our targeted industries, a slowdown or reversal of the trend to outsource IT services in any of these industries or the introduction of regulations that restrict or discourage companies from outsourcing could result in a decrease in the demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other developments in the industries in which we operate may also lead to a decline in the demand for our services, and we may not be able to successfully anticipate and prepare for any such changes. Decreased demand for our services, or increased pricing pressure on us from our customers in these key industries could adversely affect our results of operations.\nFurthermore, developments in the industries we serve and our expansion into new industries could shift customer demand to new services, solutions or technology. If our customers demand new services, solutions or technologies, we may be less competitive in these new areas or may need to make significant investments to meet that demand. Additionally, as we expand into serving new verticals, our solutions and technology may be used by, or generally affect, a broader base of customers and end users, which may expose us to new business and operational risks.\nIf our pricing structures are based on inaccurate expectations and assumptions regarding the cost and complexity of performing our work, or if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services, then our contracts could be unprofitable.\nWe face a number of risks when pricing our contracts and setting terms with our customers. Our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts, assumptions and predictions about our projects, the marketplace, global economic conditions (including foreign exchange volatility) and the coordination of operations and personnel in multiple locations with different skill sets and competencies. Our pricing and cost estimates for the work that we perform may include anticipated long-term cost savings that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract. Because of these inherent uncertainties, we may underprice our projects (particularly with fixed-price contracts), fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts. Any increased or unexpected costs, delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings, or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work, including those caused by factors outside our control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable. Moreover, if we are not able to pass on to our customers increases in compensation costs (whether driven by competition for talent or ordinary-course pay increases) or charge premium prices when justified by market demand or the type of service, our profitability may suffer.\nIn addition, a number of our contracts contain conditions in pricing terms that are dependent on our ability to meet defined performance goals, service levels and completion schedules. Our failure to meet these specified conditions or our failure to meet customer expectations in such contracts may result in less profitable or unprofitable engagements.\nIf we are not successful in managing increasingly large and complex projects, we may not achieve our financial goals and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTo successfully perform larger and more complex projects, we need to establish and maintain effective, close relationships with our customers, continue high levels of customer satisfaction and develop a thorough understanding of our customers\u2019 operations. In addition, we may face a number of challenges managing larger and more complex projects, including:\n\u2022\nmaintaining high-quality control and process execution standards;\n\u2022\nmaintaining planned resource utilization rates on a consistent basis and using an efficient mix of on-site, off-site and offshore staffing;\n\u2022\nmaintaining productivity levels and implementing necessary process improvements; and\n\u2022\ncontrolling costs.\nOur ability to successfully manage large and complex projects depends significantly on the skills of our professionals. In addition, large and complex projects may involve multiple engagements or stages, and there is a risk that a customer may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements. Such cancellations or delays may make it difficult to plan our project resource requirements. If we fail to successfully obtain engagements for large and complex projects, we may not achieve our revenue growth and other financial goals. Even if we are successful in obtaining such engagements, failure to effectively manage these large and complex projects could damage our reputation, cause us to lose business, compress our margins and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe face risks associated with having a long selling and implementation cycle for our services that require us to make significant resource commitments prior to realizing revenues for those services.\nWe have a long selling cycle for our services. Before potential customers commit to use our services, they require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them on the value of our services and our ability to meet their requirements. Therefore, our selling cycle is subject to many risks and delays over which we have little or no control, including our customers\u2019 decision to select another service provider or in-house resources to perform the services and the timing of our customers\u2019 budget cycles and approval processes. If our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens for one or more large projects, it would negatively affect the timing of our revenues and our revenue growth. In certain cases, we may begin work and incur costs prior to executing a contract. A delay in our ability to obtain a signed agreement or other evidence that the parties to the agreement have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations of an arrangement, or to complete certain contract requirements, may cause fluctuations in recognized revenues between periods.\nImplementing our services also involves a significant commitment of resources over an extended period of time from both our customers and us. Our current and future customers may not be willing or able to invest the time and resources necessary to implement our services, and we may fail to close sales with potential customers to whom we have devoted significant time and resources. Any significant failure to generate revenues or delays in recognizing revenues after incurring costs related to our sales or services processes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to collect our receivables from, or bill our unbilled services to our customers, our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our customers of the amounts they owe us for work performed. There is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our customers. If our customers suffer financial difficulties, it could cause them to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us. Timely collection of customer balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues. If we are unable to meet our contractual requirements, we might experience delays in collection of or inability to collect accounts receivable, and in such cases, our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face intense and increasing competition for customers and opportunities from onshore and offshore IT services and other consulting companies. If we are unable to compete successfully against competitors, pricing pressures or loss of market share could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe market for our services is highly competitive, and we expect competition to persist and intensify. We face competition from offshore IT services providers in other outsourcing destinations with low wage costs such as India and China, as well as competition from large, global consulting and outsourcing firms and in-house IT departments of large corporations. Customers tend to engage multiple IT services providers instead of using an exclusive IT services provider, which could reduce our revenues to the extent that customers obtain services from competing companies. Customers may prefer services providers that have more locations or that are based in countries more cost-competitive or more stable than some of the emerging markets in which we operate.\nCurrent or prospective customers may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring services from onshore to offshore service providers, which could seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide services from within the countries in which our customers operate.\nSome of our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing or technical resources; therefore, we may be unable to retain our customers while competing against such competitors. Increased competition, our inability to compete successfully, pricing pressures or loss of market share could have a material adverse effect on our business. Customer buying patterns can change if customers become more price sensitive and accepting of low-cost suppliers with less emphasis on quality.\nIf we are unable to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, methodologies and evolving industry standards we may lose customers and our business could be materially adversely affected.\nRapidly changing technologies, methodologies and evolving industry standards are inherent in the market for our services. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to anticipate developments in our industry, enhance our existing services and to develop and introduce new services to keep pace with such changes and developments and to meet changing customer needs. The process of developing our customer solutions is extremely complex and is expected to become increasingly complex and expensive in the future due to the introduction of new platforms, operating systems, technologies and methodologies. Our ability to keep pace with, anticipate or respond to these changes is subject to a number of risks, including that:\n\u2022\nwe may find it difficult or costly to update our services, applications, tools and software and to develop new services quickly enough to meet our customers\u2019 needs;\n\u2022\nwe may find it difficult or costly to make some features of our software work effectively and securely over the Internet or with new or changed operating systems;\n\u2022\nwe may find it difficult or costly to update our software and services to keep pace with evolving industry standards, methodologies, regulatory and other developments in the industries where our customers operate; and\n\u2022\nwe may find it difficult to maintain a high level of quality in implementing new technologies and methodologies.\nWe may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely manner, or if we do respond, the services, technologies or methodologies we develop or implement may not be successful in the marketplace. Further, services, technologies or methodologies that are developed by our competitors may render our services non-competitive or obsolete. Our failure to enhance our existing services and to develop and introduce new services to promptly address the needs of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUndetected software design defects, errors or failures may result in loss of business or in liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur software development solutions involve a high degree of technological complexity, have unique specifications and could contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect or correct. Errors or defects may result in the loss of current customers and loss of, or delay in, revenues, loss of market share, loss of customer data, a failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance, diversion of development resources and increased support or service costs. We cannot provide assurance that, despite testing by our customers and us, errors will not be found in new software product development solutions. Any such errors could result in litigation, other claims for damages against us, as well as reputational harm and thus could materially adversely affect our business.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to network security could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have access to collect, store, process, and transmit sensitive or confidential data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. Physical security and the secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to human error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, misappropriated, lost or stolen. Such a breach or disruption could also disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, as well as require us to expend significant resources to protect against further breaches and to rectify problems caused by these events. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under applicable laws, and regulatory penalties and could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position.\nWe may be liable to our customers for damages caused by the disclosure of confidential information, system failures or errors.\nIf any person, including any of our personnel, misappropriates sensitive or confidential customer information, including personally identifiable information, we could be subject to significant liability from our customers or from our customers\u2019 customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws. Some of our customer agreements do not limit our potential liability for certain types of occurrences, including breaches of confidentiality and infringement indemnity. Furthermore, breaches of confidentiality may entitle the aggrieved party to equitable remedies, including injunctive relief. Any such breach or misappropriation resulting in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information, or a violation of intellectual property rights, whether through employee misconduct, breach of our computer systems, systems failure or otherwise, may subject us to liabilities, damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers.\nIf we cause disruptions to our customers\u2019 businesses or provide inadequate service, our customers may have claims for substantial damages against us, which could cause us to lose customers, have a negative effect on our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf our billable professionals make errors in the course of delivering services to our customers or fail to consistently meet the service requirements of a customer, these errors or failures could disrupt the customer\u2019s business, which could result in a reduction in our revenues or a claim for substantial damages against us, and could also result in a customer terminating our engagement. Any failure in a customer\u2019s system or breach of security relating to the services we provide to the customer could damage our reputation or result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. The assertion of one or more large claims against us, whether or not successful, could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant failure in our systems, telecommunications or IT infrastructure could harm our service model, which could result in a reduction of our revenues and otherwise disrupt our business.\nOur service model relies on maintaining active voice and data communications, online resource management, financial and operational record management, customer service and data processing systems between our client sites, our delivery centers and our customer management locations. Our business activities may be materially disrupted in the event of a partial or complete failure of any of these technologies, which could be due to software malfunction, computer virus attacks, conversion errors due to system upgrades, damage from fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, unauthorized entry, demands placed on internet infrastructure by growing numbers of users and time spent online, increased bandwidth requirements or other events beyond our control. Loss of all or part of the infrastructure or systems for a period of time could hinder our performance or our ability to complete customer projects on time which, in turn, could lead to a reduction of our revenues or otherwise materially adversely affect our business and business reputation.\nOur ability to generate and retain business could depend on our reputation in the marketplace.\nOur services are marketed to customers and prospective customers based on a number of factors. Since many of our specific customer engagements involve unique services and solutions, our corporate reputation is a significant factor in our customers\u2019 evaluation of whether to engage our services, and our customers\u2019 perception of our ability to add value through our services is critical to the profitability of our engagements. We believe the EPAM brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees.\nHowever, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by current or former customers and employees, competitors, vendors, adversaries in legal proceedings, government regulators, as well as members of the investment community and the media. There is a risk that negative information about our Company, even if untrue, could adversely affect our business. In particular, damage to our reputation could be challenging to repair, could make potential or existing customers reluctant to select us for new engagements, and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the EPAM brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us.\nWe may invest substantial cash in new facilities and physical infrastructure, and our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately.\nTo support the continued growth of our business, we may invest in new facilities and physical infrastructure. We may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities. These expansions will likely increase our fixed costs and if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately, our profitability may be reduced.\nIf we fail to integrate or manage acquired companies efficiently, or if the acquired companies do not perform to our expectations, our overall profitability and growth plans could be materially adversely affected.\nPart of our expansion strategy includes strategic acquisitions. These transactions involve significant challenges, including the risk that an acquisition does not advance our business strategy, that we do not achieve a satisfactory return on our investment, that we are unable to successfully integrate an acquired company\u2019s employees, customer relationships and operations, and that the transactions divert significant management attention and financial resources from our ongoing business. These challenges could disrupt our ongoing business and increase our expenses, including causing us to incur significant one-time expenses and write-offs, and making it more difficult and complex for our management to effectively manage our operations. If we are not able to successfully integrate an acquired entity and its operations and to realize the benefits envisioned for such acquisition, our overall growth and profitability plans may be adversely affected.\nOur effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors.\nWe conduct business globally and file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors, including changes in the amount of income taxed by or allocated to the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates; changing tax laws, regulations and interpretations of such tax laws in multiple jurisdictions; and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits or examinations and any related interest or penalties.\nThe determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation, judgment and calculations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain. Our determination of tax liability is always subject to review or examination by authorities in various jurisdictions. If a tax authority in any jurisdiction reviews any of our tax returns and proposes an adjustment, including, but not limited to, a determination that the transfer prices and terms we have applied are not appropriate, such an adjustment could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, any significant changes to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cU.S. Tax Act\u201d) enacted in 2017, or to regulatory guidance associated with the U.S. Tax Act, could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate.\nOur operating results may be negatively impacted by the loss of certain tax benefits provided to companies in our industry by the governments of Belarus and other countries.\nIn Belarus, our local subsidiary along with other member technology companies of High-Technologies Park have a full exemption from Belarus income tax and value added tax until 2049 and are taxed at reduced rates on a variety of other taxes. In Russia, our local subsidiary along with other qualified IT companies, benefit from paying obligatory social contributions to the government at a significantly reduced rate as well as an exemption from value added tax in certain circumstances. If these tax benefits are changed, terminated, not extended or comparable new tax incentives are not introduced, we expect that our effective income tax rate and/or our operating expenses would increase significantly, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Provision for Income Taxes.\u201d\nThere may be adverse tax and employment law consequences if the independent contractor status of some of our personnel or the exempt status of our employees is successfully challenged.\nIn several countries, certain of our personnel are retained as independent contractors. The criteria to determine whether an individual is considered an independent contractor or an employee are typically fact sensitive and vary by jurisdiction, as can the interpretation of the applicable laws. If a government authority or court makes any adverse determination with respect to some or all of our independent contractors, we could incur significant costs, including for prior periods, in respect of tax withholding, social security taxes or payments, workers\u2019 compensation and unemployment contributions, and recordkeeping, or we may be required to modify our business model, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us against losses.\nAlthough we maintain some insurance coverage, including professional liability insurance, property insurance coverage for certain of our facilities and equipment and business interruption insurance coverage for certain of our operations, we do not insure for all risks in our operations. If any claims for injury are brought against us, or if we experience any business disruption, litigation or natural disaster, we might incur substantial costs and diversion of resources.\nMost of the agreements we have entered into with our customers require us to purchase and maintain specified insurance coverage during the terms of the agreements, including commercial general insurance or public liability insurance, umbrella insurance, product liability insurance, and workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Some of these types of insurance are not available on reasonable terms or at all in some countries in which we operate.\nThe banking and financial systems in less developed markets where we hold funds remain less developed than those in some more developed markets, and a banking crisis could place liquidity constraints on our business and materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe have cash in banks in countries such as Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Armenia, where the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability, banking and other financial systems generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets, and bank deposits made by corporate entities are not insured. A banking crisis, or the bankruptcy or insolvency of banks through which we receive or with which we hold funds, particularly in Belarus, may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions in that region, which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur business could be negatively affected if we incur legal liability, including with respect to our indemnification obligations, in connection with providing our solutions and services.\nIf we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our customers, we could be subject to legal liability. If we cannot or do not perform our obligations, we could face legal liability and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope and/or amount of our potential liability. As a result, we might face significant legal liability and payment obligations, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, as we expand our business through strategic acquisitions and organically, our new and existing contracts with customers may contain terms that do not fully protect us against new risks, which may increase our potential exposure to losses.\nWe may not be able to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property, and our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business and competitive position.\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition and trade secret laws, as well as intellectual property assignment and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our intellectual property rights. Protection of intellectual property rights and confidentiality in some countries in which we operate may not be as effective as in the United States or other countries with more mature legal systems.\nWhen personnel start with EPAM, we require our employees and independent contractors to enter into written agreements, which assign to EPAM all intellectual property and work product made, developed or conceived by them in connection with their employment or engagement with us. These agreements also provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed or otherwise made available by us be kept confidential. These agreements may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, and we cannot ensure that we would be successful in defending a challenge by our current or former employees or independent contractors to such agreements. We also enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our customers and certain vendors; however, these agreements may not fully protect our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure. Reverse engineering, unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our and our customers\u2019 proprietary technologies, tools and applications could enable third parties to benefit from our or our customers\u2019 technologies, tools and applications without paying them for doing so, and our customers may hold us liable for that act and seek damages and compensation from us, which could harm our business and competitive position.\nWe rely on our trademarks, trade names, service marks and brand names to distinguish our services and solutions from the services of our competitors, and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. Third parties may oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of our trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our services and solutions, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Further, we cannot provide assurance that competitors will not infringe our trademarks, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nWe may need to enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation. Litigation relating to our intellectual property may not prove successful and might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.\nWe may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to defend. If we fail to defend ourselves against such claims, we may lose significant intellectual property rights and may be unable to continue providing our existing services.\nOur success largely depends on our ability to use and develop our technology, tools, code, methodologies and services without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, including patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks. We may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of other intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe typically indemnify customers who purchase our services and solutions against potential infringement of intellectual property rights, which subjects us to the risk of indemnification claims. These claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers, regardless of the merits of these claims and are often not subject to liability limits or exclusion of consequential, indirect or punitive damages. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers, redesign or cease offering our allegedly infringing services or solutions, or obtain licenses for the intellectual property that such services or solutions allegedly infringe. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our services or solutions.\nThe holders of patents and other intellectual property rights potentially relevant to our service offerings may make it difficult for us to acquire a license on commercially acceptable terms. In addition, we may be unaware of intellectual property registrations or applications relating to our services that may give rise to potential infringement claims against us. There may also be technologies licensed to and relied on by us that are subject to infringement or other corresponding allegations or claims by third parties, which may damage our ability to rely on such technologies.\nParties making infringement claims may be able to obtain an injunction to prevent us from delivering our services or using technology involving the allegedly infringing intellectual property. Intellectual property litigation is expensive, time-consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention from our business. Protracted litigation could also result in existing or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our software product development services or solutions until resolution of such litigation, or could require us to indemnify our customers against infringement claims in certain instances. Any of these actions, regardless of the outcome of litigation or merits of the claim, could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other countries in which we operate, including export restrictions, economic sanctions and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-corruption laws. If we are not in compliance with applicable legal requirements, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures.\nAs a company with international operations, we are subject to many laws and regulations restricting our operations, including activities involving restricted countries, organizations, entities and persons that have been identified as unlawful actors or that are subject to U.S. sanctions imposed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, or other international sanctions that prohibit us from engaging in trade or financial transactions with certain countries, businesses, organizations and individuals. We are subject to the FCPA, which prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in other countries. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices, although adherence to local customs and practices is generally not a defense under U.S. and other anti-bribery laws.\nWe have a compliance program with controls and procedures designed to ensure our compliance with the FCPA, OFAC sanctions, and other sanctions, laws and regulations. The continuing implementation and ongoing development and monitoring of the program may be time consuming and expensive, and could result in the discovery of issues or violations with respect to the foregoing by us or our employees, independent contractors, subcontractors or agents of which we were previously unaware.\nAny violations of these or other laws, regulations and procedures by our employees, independent contractors, subcontractors and agents could expose us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, fines or business restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and would adversely affect our reputation and the market for shares of our common stock and may require certain of our investors to disclose their investment in our Company under certain state laws.\nChanges in the European regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could expose us to risks of noncompliance and costs associated with compliance.\nEPAM is subject to the European GDPR, which imposes significant restrictions and requirements relating to the processing of personal data that are more burdensome than current privacy standards in the United States. GDPR establishes complex legal obligations that organizations must follow with respect to the processing of personal data, including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the European Union to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security, and the imposition of additional notification, security and other control measures.\nOur customers and we are at risk of enforcement actions taken by the European Union data protection authorities, and we may face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations, which could result in penalties and fines for non-compliance. Moreover, individuals or organizations can make direct claims against us in the event of any loss or damage as a result of a breach of these regulations.\nSome customers are seeking additional assurances from us about our processing of personal data provided or made available by our customers to us in the course of our business. The burden of compliance with additional customer requirements may result in significant additional cost, complexity and risk in our services. We may experience changes in customer behaviors due to the potential risks resulting from the implementation of GDPR. We are required to establish processes and change certain operations in relation to the processing of personal data as a result of GDPR, which may involve substantial expense and distraction from other aspects of our business.\nAnti-outsourcing legislation and restrictions on immigration, if adopted, may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to customers in the United States or other countries, which could hamper our growth and cause our revenues to decline.\nThe majority of our professionals are offshore. Some of our projects require a portion of the work to be undertaken at our customers\u2019 facilities, which may require our personnel to obtain work authorizations to travel and work at client sites outside of our personnel\u2019s home countries. The ability of our employees to work in necessary locations around the world depends on their ability to obtain the required visas and work permits, and this process can be lengthy and difficult. Immigration laws are subject to legislative change, as well as to variations in standards of application and enforcement due to political forces and economic conditions. Moreover, delays in the process to obtain visas may result in delays in the ability of our personnel to travel to meet with our customers, provide services to our customers or to continue to provide services on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, the issue of companies outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in many countries, including the United States, which is our largest source of revenues. It is possible that pending legislation in the United States regarding offshore outsourcing may impose restrictions on our ability to deploy employees holding U.S. work visas to customer locations, which could adversely impact our business. If enacted, such measures may broaden restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly, impact private industry with measures such as tax disincentives or intellectual property transfer restrictions, and/or restrict the use of certain work visas.\nOur reliance on visas for a number of employees makes us vulnerable to such changes and variations as it affects our ability to staff projects with employees who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed. We may not be able to obtain a sufficient number of visas for our employees or we may encounter delays or additional costs in obtaining or maintaining such visas, in which case we may not be able to provide services to our customers on a timely and cost-effective basis or manage our sales and delivery centers as efficiently as we otherwise could, any of which could hamper our growth and cause our revenues to decline.\nOur subsidiaries in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine can be forced into liquidation on the basis of formal noncompliance with certain legal requirements.\nWe operate in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine primarily through locally organized subsidiaries. Certain provisions of Russian law and the laws of the other countries may allow a court to order liquidation of a locally organized legal entity on the basis of its formal noncompliance with certain requirements during formation, reorganization or during its operations. If the company fails to comply with certain requirements including those relating to minimum net assets, governmental or local authorities can seek the involuntary liquidation of such company in court, and the company\u2019s creditors will have the right to accelerate their claims or demand early performance of the company\u2019s obligations as well as demand compensation for any damages. If involuntary liquidation of any of our subsidiaries were to occur, such liquidation could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need additional capital, and a failure by us to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us, or at all, could limit our ability to grow our business and develop or enhance our service offerings to respond to market demand or competitive challenges.\nWe believe that our current cash, cash flow from operations and revolving line of credit are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months. We may, however, require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If these resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain another credit facility, and we cannot be certain that such additional financing would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders, and additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could impose operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations.\nOur stock price is volatile.\nOur common stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results, announcements by our competitors and us, projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts or uncertainty about current global economic conditions. The stock market, as a whole, also has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance. Furthermore, we believe our stock price should reflect future growth and profitability expectations and, if we fail to meet these expectations, our stock price may significantly decline.\nOur liability-classified restricted stock units, which are subject to mark-to-market accounting, and the calculation of weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in accordance with the treasury method are both affected by our stock price. Any fluctuations in the price of our stock will affect our future operating results.", "PERMNO": 13210, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "EPAM"}
