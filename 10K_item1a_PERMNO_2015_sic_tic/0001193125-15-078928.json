RISK FACTORS\nThe risks described below may materially impact your investment in our company or may in the future, and, in some cases already do, materially affect us and our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should carefully consider these factors with respect to your investment in our securities.\nWe face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively may negatively affect sales of our products and services.\nCompetition in the medical diagnostic product and other markets in which we operate is intense and expected to increase as new products, services and technologies become available and new competitors enter the market. Our competitors in the United States and abroad are numerous and include, among others, diagnostic testing and medical products companies, universities and other research institutions. Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities, clinical, manufacturing, regulatory and marketing experience and financial and managerial resources than we do. Our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected by:\n\u2022\ncustomers\u2019 perceptions of the comparative quality of our competitors\u2019 products or services;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture, in a cost-effective way, sufficient quantities of our products to meet customer demand;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our competitors to develop products, services and technologies that are more effective than ours or that render ours obsolete;\n\u2022\nour competitors\u2019 ability to obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would prevent us from offering competing products or services;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our competitors to obtain regulatory approval for the commercialization of products or services more rapidly or effectively than we do; and\n\u2022\ncompetitive pricing by our competitors, particularly in emerging markets.\nIn addition, as markets for our products become saturated with competing products, such as for our meter-based Alere Triage BNP test, the growth rates of sales unit volume and average selling prices for those products may decline, which may adversely impact our product sales, gross margins and overall financial results. This may occur even if we are able to successfully introduce new products in these markets, and achieve market acceptance of those products, in a timely manner.\nWe face risks and uncertainties relating to the FDA warning letter and OIG subpoena.\nOn October 9, 2012, we received a warning letter from the FDA referencing inspectional observations set forth in an FDA Form 483 that we received in June 2012. The observations were the result of an inspection of our San Diego facility conducted earlier during 2012 relating to our Alere Triage products, which resulted in two recalls of certain Alere Triage products and revised release specifications for our Alere Triage meter-based products. We have submitted evidence of our completion of most of the actions we committed to in response to the FDA Form 483 and warning letter. In September 2014, as follow up to a further inspection of our San Diego facility, the FDA notified us that this most recent inspection was classified \u201cvoluntary action indicated,\u201d meaning that the objectionable conditions or practices found in the inspection do not meet the threshold of significance requiring regulatory action, but that the formal close-out of the October 2012 warning letter could not occur until after a future inspection.\nIn May 2012, Alere San Diego, Inc. received a subpoena from the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or the OIG, seeking documents relating primarily to the quality control testing and performance characteristics of our Alere Triage cardiac marker devices and the Triage TOX Drug Screen manufactured at Alere San Diego. We have provided documents in response to the OIG subpoena, and the investigation is ongoing.\nWe cannot assure you that the government will find our efforts to resolve the FDA warning letter or the investigation initiated by the OIG subpoena to be satisfactory. We may be unable to implement corrective actions within a timeframe or in a manner satisfactory to the FDA. Failure to do so can result in enforcement proceedings by the government, which may include potential civil or criminal fines and penalties, including disgorgement of amounts earned on any legally-adulterated products; injunctive relief, which could limit, modify or constrain our ability to manufacture, market and sell our products; and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. We have received inquiries from regulatory authorities outside the United States regarding the Alere Triage recalls in the United States and, in at least one case, remedial or corrective action was required. We cannot predict whether other governments\u2019 regulatory authorities will require additional remedial or corrective actions in the future. The investigation initiated by the OIG subpoena can result in civil or criminal fines or penalties, increased supervision of our business operations by the OIG, or exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. We are unable to predict when these matters will be resolved or what action, if any, the government will take in connection with these matters. The issues arising out of the FDA inspection and OIG subpoena may be expanded to cover other matters. We can also face product liability, third-party payer, shareholder, or other litigation. Any of these risks and uncertainties can adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe may experience difficulties that delay or prevent our development, introduction or marketing of new or enhanced products or services.\nOur success depends on our ability to effectively introduce new and competitive products and services. The development of new or enhanced products or services is a complex, costly and uncertain process and is becoming increasingly complex and uncertain in the United States. Furthermore, developing and manufacturing new products and services require us to anticipate customers\u2019 and patients\u2019 needs and emerging technology trends accurately. We may experience research and development, manufacturing, regulatory, marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent our introduction of new or enhanced products and services. The research and development process in the healthcare industry generally takes a significant amount of time from design stage to product launch. This process is conducted in various stages, and each stage presents the risk that we will not achieve our goals. We may have to abandon a product in which we have invested substantial resources. We cannot be certain that:\n\u2022\nany of our products or services under development will prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwe will be able to obtain, in a timely manner or at all, necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nthe products and services we develop can be manufactured or provided at acceptable cost and with appropriate quality; or\n\u2022\nthese products and services, if and when approved, can be successfully marketed.\nThese factors, as well as manufacturing or distribution problems or other factors beyond our control, could delay the launch of new products or services. Any delay in the development, approval, production, marketing or distribution of a new product or service could materially and adversely affect our competitive position, our branding and our results of operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by international business risks.\nWe generate a significant percentage of our net revenue from outside the United States, and a significant number of our employees, including manufacturing, sales, support, and research and development personnel, are located outside the United States, including in Africa, Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Norway, the Philippines, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. Conducting business outside the United States subjects us to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nlost revenues as a result of macroeconomic developments, such as the current European budgetary issues, debt crisis and related European financial restructuring efforts, which may cause European governments to reduce spending and cause the value of the Euro to further deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power of European customers and the dollar value of European sales;\n\u2022\ndecreased liquidity resulting from longer accounts receivable collection cycles typical of foreign countries;\n\u2022\nlower productivity resulting from difficulties we encounter in staffing and managing sales, support, and research and development operations across many countries;\n\u2022\nlost revenues or unexpected expenses resulting from difficulties associated with enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nlost revenues or unexpected expenses resulting from disputes with third-party distributors of our products or from third parties claiming distribution rights to our products under foreign laws or legal systems;\n\u2022\nlost revenues or unexpected expenses resulting from the imposition by foreign governments of trade barriers such as tariffs, quotas, preferential bidding, and import restrictions;\n\u2022\nhigher cost of sales resulting from import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nlost revenues or other adverse effects resulting from acts of war, terrorism, theft or other lawless conduct or otherwise resulting from economic, social or political instability in or affecting foreign countries in which we sell our products or operate;\n\u2022\nlost revenues or other adverse effects resulting from international sanctions regimes;\n\u2022\nadverse effects resulting from changes in foreign regulatory or other laws affecting sales of our products or our foreign operations;\n\u2022\ngreater tax liability resulting from international tax laws, including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\nincreased costs to comply with changes in legislative or regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nlost revenues or increased expenses resulting from the failure of laws to protect our intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nlost revenues resulting from delays in obtaining import or export licenses, transportation difficulties and delays resulting from inadequate local infrastructure.\nOur international operations subject us to varied and complex domestic, foreign and international laws and regulations, as further discussed below. Compliance with these laws and regulations often involves significant costs or requires changes in our business practices that may reduce revenues and profitability.\nWe could incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our global operations and could become subject to legal penalties if we do not comply with certain regulations.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are subject to a number of legal requirements, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the customs, export, trade sanctions and anti-boycott laws of the U.S., including those administered by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Department of Commerce and the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Treasury Department, as well as those of other nations in which we do business. Compliance with these laws and regulations is complex and involves significant costs. In addition, our training and compliance programs and our other internal control policies may not always protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. Any violation of these requirements by us, our employees or our agents may subject us to significant criminal and civil liability.\nBecause our business relies heavily on foreign operations and revenues, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and our need to convert currencies may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business relies heavily on our foreign operations. Eight of our ten largest manufacturing operations are located in Canada, China, Germany, Japan, Norway, South Korea and the United Kingdom, and we also have manufacturing operations in India and Israel. We have significant research and development operations in Germany and the United Kingdom, and we conduct additional research and development activities in China, Israel, Japan and South Korea. In addition, for 2014, approximately 47% of our net revenue was derived from sales outside the United States. Because of the scope of our foreign operations and foreign sales, we face significant exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as our business practices evolve and could result in increased costs or reduced revenue and could affect our actual cash flow. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and, in some instances, may have a significant impact on our operating results. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can cost-effectively mitigate these risks.\nHealthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010), or the ACA, makes comprehensive reforms at the federal and state level affecting the coverage and payment for healthcare services in the United States. The ACA contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of Medicare and Medicaid. While certain provisions of the ACA took effect immediately, others have delayed effective dates. Given the scope of the changes made by the ACA and the ongoing implementation efforts, we cannot predict the impact of every aspect of the new law on our operations.\nIn particular, the ACA significantly alters Medicare Advantage reimbursements by setting the federal benchmark payment closer to the payments in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program. This change could reduce our revenues from the Medicare Advantage plans for which we perform services, although the precise effect on any particular plan, much less the impact on us, is impossible to predict. Effective January 1, 2013, the ACA includes a 2.3% excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices sold outside of the retail setting. For 2014, we incurred $9.8 million in excise tax expense related to the domestic sale of our medical device products as a result of the implementation of this tax. Legislative provisions impose federal reporting requirements regarding payments or relationships between manufacturers of covered drugs, devices or biological or medical supplies, and physicians, among others.\nAdditionally, revenues associated with our diabetes business have been impacted by the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies, or the DMEPOS, Competitive Bidding Program operated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS. Under this program, Medicare no longer reimburses suppliers for certain products and services, including mail-order diabetes testing supplies, based on the Medicare fee schedule amount. Instead CMS now provides reimbursement for those products and services based on a competitive bidding process. While the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program limits the number of potential participants in the mail-order diabetes testing supplies market, it also requires us to sell diabetes supplies subject to Medicare reimbursement at significantly lower prices, which has had a material adverse effect on the profitability of these products.\nLegislative and regulatory bodies, including Congress, are likely to continue to pursue healthcare reform initiatives and may continue to reduce the funding of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including Medicare Advantage, in an effort to reduce overall healthcare spending. The ultimate impact of all of the reforms in the ACA, and its impact on us, is impossible to predict. If all of the reforms in the legislation are implemented, or if other reforms in the United States or elsewhere are adopted, those reforms may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the results of clinical studies required to gain regulatory approval to sell our products are not available when expected, or do not demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of those products, we may be unable to sell those products.\nBefore we can sell certain of our products, we must conduct clinical studies intended to demonstrate that those products are safe and effective and perform as expected. The results of these clinical studies are used to obtain regulatory approval from government authorities such as the FDA. Clinical studies are experiments involving human patients having the diseases or medical conditions that the product is trying to evaluate or diagnose. Conducting clinical studies is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. In some cases, we may spend several years completing the necessary clinical studies.\nIf we fail to adequately manage our clinical studies, those clinical studies and corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our products altogether. Even if we successfully manage our clinical studies, we may not obtain favorable results and may not obtain\nregulatory approval. If we are unable to market and sell our new products or are unable to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to obtain required clearances or approvals for the commercialization of our products in the United States, we would not be able to sell those products in the United States.\nOur future performance depends on, among other matters, the timely receipt of necessary regulatory approvals for new products. Regulatory approval can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. In addition, regulatory processes are subject to change, and new or changed regulations can result in increased costs and unanticipated delays.\nIn the United States, clearance or approval to commercially distribute new medical devices is received from the FDA through clearance of a Premarket Notification 510(k), or 510(k), or through a Premarket Approval, or PMA. The FDA may deny 510(k) clearance because, among other reasons, it determines that our product is not substantially equivalent to another U.S. legally marketed device. The FDA may deny a PMA because, among other reasons, it determines that our product is not sufficiently safe or effective. As part of the clearance or approval process, if we intend to sell certain diagnostic tests for home use or for use by laboratories holding a CLIA Certificate of Waiver, including most physician office laboratories, we must generally provide data, demonstrating to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction, that the criteria for our tests are simple with a low risk of error. Failure to obtain FDA clearance or approval would preclude commercialization in the U.S. and failure to obtain or maintain CLIA-waived status for any product would preclude us from selling that product for home use or to CLIA-waived laboratories, which could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations.\nModifications or enhancements that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness, or that constitute a major change in the intended use of the device, require new 510(k) or PMA submissions. We have made modifications to some of our products since receipt of initial 510(k) clearance or PMA. With respect to several of these modifications, we filed new 510(k)s describing the modifications and received FDA 510(k) clearance. We have made other modifications to some of our products that we believe do not require the submission of new 510(k)s or PMAs. The FDA may not agree with any of our determinations not to submit a new 510(k) or PMA for any of these modifications made to our products. If the FDA requires us to submit a new 510(k) or PMA for any device modification, we may be prohibited from marketing the modified products until the new submission is cleared or approved by the FDA. As long as our San Diego facility remains subject to the FDA warning letter that we received in October 2012, that facility may be ineligible to receive PMA approvals. While no PMA submissions are currently pending for that facility and we do not plan any new submissions for that facility in 2015, if we are unable to resolve the warning letter in a timely manner, our ability to gain approval for new or enhanced products could be adversely impacted.\nWe are subject to regulatory approval requirements of the foreign countries in which we sell our products, and these requirements may prevent or delay us from marketing our products in those countries.\nWe are subject to the regulatory approval requirements for each foreign country in which we sell our products. The process for complying with these approval requirements can be lengthy and expensive. Any changes in foreign approval requirements and processes may cause us to incur additional costs or lengthen review times of our products. We may not be able to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, and any failure to do so may cause us to incur additional costs or prevent us from marketing our products in foreign countries, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Some foreign governments require export certificates from the FDA in order for us to market our products in their countries. If we are unable to obtain these certificates from the FDA, we may be unable to market our products in certain foreign countries.\nOur business is subject to substantial regulatory oversight and our failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in significant costs or, in certain circumstances, the suspension or withdrawal of previously obtained clearances or approvals.\nOur businesses are extensively regulated by the FDA and other federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies. These regulations impact many aspects of our operations, including development, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, physician interaction and record-keeping.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory agencies may require post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the performance of approved products or may place conditions on any product approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of those products. The discovery of problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product, including notices of correction or product recalls, such as our December 2014 voluntary urgent medical device correction initiated with respect to our Alere INRatio and Alere INRatio2 systems and our April 2014 recall of our Alere INRatio2 PT/INR Professional Test Strips, or even withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, in some cases we may sell products or provide services which are reliant on the use or commercial availability of products of third parties, including medical devices, equipment or pharmaceuticals, and regulatory restrictions placed upon any such third-party products could have a material adverse impact on the sales or commercial viability of our related products or services. We are subject to routine inspection by the FDA and other agencies for compliance with the Quality System Regulation and Medical Device Reporting requirements in the United States and other applicable regulations worldwide. Our manufacturing facilities and those of our suppliers and distributors also are, or can be, subject to periodic regulatory inspections.\nUnder CLIA, some of our drug testing laboratories in the United States are required to be certified to meet quality assurance, quality control and personnel standards. Laboratories also must undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspections. Our laboratories that perform drug testing on employees of federal government contractors and some other entities are regulated by the United States SAMHSA, which has established detailed performance and quality standards that laboratories must meet in order to perform this work.\nPortions of our business are subject to unique licensing or permit requirements. For example, we may be required to obtain certification to participate in governmental payment programs, such as state or federal Medicaid/Medicare programs. We may need an operating license in some states, and some states have established Certificate of Need programs regulating the expansion of healthcare operations.\nWe are also subject to laws relating to matters such as privacy, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances.\nWe may incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products or injunctions against our distribution of products, termination of our service agreements by our customers, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. Changes in applicable laws, changes in the interpretation or application of such laws, or any failure to comply with existing or future laws, regulations or standards which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects. Moreover, new laws may be enacted, or regulatory agencies may impose new or enhanced standards, that would increase our costs, as well as expose us to risks associated with non-compliance.\nWe are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations that could result in significant liability, require us to change our business practices and restrict our operations in the future.\nWe are subject to laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly\nand willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any payer, not only the Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration programs. These laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical devices by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, with hospitals, physicians, laboratories and other potential purchasers of medical devices and related services.\nOther laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. These laws may also be triggered by failure to return identified overpayments to a payer. Anti-kickback and false claims laws prescribe civil and/or criminal penalties for noncompliance that can be substantial including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the United States, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs.\nOn December 5, 2014, CMS issued a final rule titled \u201cRequirements for Medicare Incentive Reward Program and Provider Enrollment.\u201d This rule implemented several provider enrollment requirements, including a significant, new regulatory provision that will permit CMS to revoke Medicare billing privileges for a provider or supplier that has a pattern or practice of submitting claims that fail to meet Medicare requirements. The provisions of the new rule became effective on February 3, 2015. In determining whether a provider or suppler is subject to revocation of its billing privileges pursuant to this rule, CMS will consider the following criteria:\n\u2022\nthe percentage of submitted claims that were denied;\n\u2022\nthe reason(s) for the claim denials;\n\u2022\nwhether the provider or supplier has any history of final adverse actions and the nature of any such actions;\n\u2022\nthe length of time over which the pattern continued;\n\u2022\nhow long the provider or supplier has been enrolled in Medicare; and\n\u2022\nany other information regarding the provider or supplier\u2019s specific circumstances that CMS deems relevant.\nSince we are reimbursed directly by federal healthcare programs for certain goods and services and, given that many of our customers rely on reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs to cover a substantial portion of their expenditures, our exclusion from such programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid change.\nBilling and payment for healthcare services are highly regulated, and the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in civil or criminal sanctions, including exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs.\nA portion of our healthcare products and services are paid for by private and governmental third-party payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These third-party payers typically have different and complex billing and documentation requirements that we must satisfy in order to receive payment, and they carefully audit and monitor our compliance with these requirements. Governmental payers and their agents, including Medicare Administrative Contractors, Zone Program Integrity Contractors, and\nothers, as well as the Department of Health and Human Services, the OIG, CMS and state Medicaid programs, conduct audits in the ordinary course of our operations. These audits focus on compliance with coverage and reimbursement rules and guidelines under Medicare and Medicaid. These types of audits often lead to determinations that certain claims should not have been paid by Medicare and/or Medicaid, and the programs seek to recoup or offset amounts they assert have been paid in error. We regularly receive notices of such determinations of overpayment, which vary widely in amount. These determinations are subject to administrative appeal rights, which we routinely pursue. The timeframe for these appeals can be long and the results are often unpredictable. Depending on the nature of the audit, overpayment determinations can be substantial.\nWe must also comply with numerous other laws applicable to billing and payment for healthcare services, including privacy laws. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in non-payment, refunds, exclusion from government healthcare programs, and civil or criminal liabilities, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. In addition, failure by third-party payers to properly process our payment claims in a timely manner could delay our receipt of payment for our products and services, which may have a material adverse effect on our cash flows.\nIncreasing health insurance premiums and co-payments or high-deductible health plans may cause individuals to forgo health insurance and avoid medical attention, either of which may reduce demand for our products and services.\nHealth insurance premiums, co-payments and deductibles have generally increased in recent years. These increases may cause individuals to forgo health insurance, as well as medical attention. This behavior may reduce demand for our point-of-care diagnostic products.\nOur ability to protect our information systems and electronic transmissions of sensitive data from data corruption, cyber-based attacks, security breaches or privacy violations is critical to the success of our business.\nWe are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to securely process, transmit and store electronic information, including personal information of our customers. Security breaches of this infrastructure, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, malware attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can cause all or portions of our websites to be unavailable, create system disruptions, shutdowns, erasure of critical data and software or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. We invest in security technology to protect our data against risks of data security breaches and cyber-attacks and we have implemented solutions, processes, and procedures to help mitigate these risks, such as encryption, virus protection, security firewalls and comprehensive information security and privacy policies. However, despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. The age of our information technology systems, as well as the level of our protection and business continuity or disaster recovery capability, varies from site to site, and there can be no guarantee that any such plans, to the extent they are in place, will be effective. In addition, a security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure of consumer information (including personally identifiable information or protected health information) could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with disparate state breach notification laws and otherwise subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. If we are unable to prevent further security breaches or privacy violations or implement satisfactory remedial measures, our operations could be disrupted, we may be subject to legal claims or proceedings, or we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss and other regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information, including sensitive consumer data, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d While we currently expend resources to protect against cyber-attacks and security breaches, hackers and other cyber criminals are using increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving techniques, and we may need to expend additional resources to continue to protect\nagainst potential security breaches or to address problems caused by such attacks or any breach of our safeguards. In addition, a data security breach could distract management or other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties.\nIn addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, this could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nOur growth is subject to global economic and political conditions, and operational disruptions at our facilities.\nOur business is affected by global economic conditions and the state of the financial markets. There can be no assurance that global economic conditions and financial markets will not worsen and that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows, results of operations, financial positions or our ability to access capital, such as the adverse effects resulting from a prolonged shutdown in government operations in both the United States and internationally. Our business is also affected by local economic conditions, including inflation, recession, financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation. Political changes, some of which may be disruptive, could interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location.\nPoor economic conditions may negatively impact our toxicology business.\nThe high rates of unemployment that have recently affected the United States and other countries negatively impact the demand for pre-employment drug testing. Additionally, reduced government funding for drug screening programs negatively impacts the market for our toxicology tests. Finally, a portion of our domestic laboratory testing services is reimbursed by Medicare and private payers and is subject to continued downward price pressure. If any, or all, of these trends continue or accelerate, they may have a material adverse impact on the results of our toxicology business operations.\nIf we deliver products with defects, we may be subject to product recalls or negative publicity, our credibility may be harmed, market acceptance of our products may decrease and we may be exposed to liability.\nThe manufacturing and marketing of professional and consumer diagnostics involve an inherent risk of product liability claims. For example, a defect in one of our diagnostic products could lead to a false positive or false negative result, affecting the eventual diagnosis. Our product development and production are extremely complex and could expose our products to defects. Manufacturing and design defects could lead to recalls (either voluntary or required by the FDA or other government authorities) and could result in the removal of a product from the market. Defects in our products could also harm our reputation, lead to negative publicity and decrease sales of our products.\nIn addition, our marketing of monitoring services may cause us to be subjected to various product liability or other claims, including, among others, claims that inaccurate monitoring results lead to injury or death, or, in the case of our toxicology monitoring services, the imposition of criminal sanctions. Any product liability or other claim brought against us, regardless of merit, could be costly to defend and could result in an increase to our insurance premiums. If we are held liable for a claim, that claim could materially damage our business and financial condition.\nWe may experience manufacturing problems or delays due to, among other reasons, our volume and specialized processes, which could result in decreased revenue or increased costs.\nThe global supply of our products depends on the uninterrupted efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities. Many of our manufacturing processes are complex and involve sensitive scientific processes, including unique and often proprietary antibodies which cannot be replicated or acquired through alternative sources without undue delay or expense. Other processes present difficult technical challenges to obtain the manufacturing yields necessary to operate profitably. In addition, our manufacturing processes may require complex and specialized equipment which can be expensive to repair or replace with required lead times of up to a year.\nThe manufacturing of certain of our products is concentrated in one or more of our plants, with limited alternate facilities. Any event that negatively impacts our manufacturing facilities, our manufacturing systems or equipment, or our contract manufacturers or suppliers could delay or suspend shipments of products or the release of new products or could result in the delivery of inferior products. Our revenues from the affected products would decline and we could incur losses until such time as we or our contract manufacturers are able to restore our or their production processes or we are able to put in place alternative contract manufacturers or suppliers.\nWe rely on suppliers for raw materials and other products and services, and fluctuations in the availability and price of such products and services may adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nWe rely on numerous third parties to supply raw materials and other components for our manufacturing processes. In some cases, these raw materials and components are available only from a sole supplier. We also rely on a number of significant third-party manufacturers to produce some of our professional diagnostics products. Stringent requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products may prevent us from quickly establishing additional or replacement sources for the raw materials, components or manufacturing services that we use or from doing so without excessive cost. As a result, a reduction or interruption in supply or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials, components or manufacturing services could have a material adverse effect on our business, result of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCompliance with the SEC\u2019s conflict minerals rules will continue to increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to the SEC\u2019s disclosure requirements for public companies that manufacture, or contract to manufacture, products for which certain minerals and their derivatives, namely tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d are necessary to the functionality or production of those products. These regulations require us to determine which of our products contain conflict minerals and, if so, to perform an extensive inquiry into our supply chain in an effort to determine whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo, or DRC, or an adjoining country. We have incurred and expect to incur further additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. Because our supply chain is complex, the country of origin inquiry and due diligence procedures that we have implemented may not enable us to ascertain the origins of any conflict minerals that we use or determine that these minerals did not originate from the DRC or an adjoining country, which may harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as DRC conflict-free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead to a loss of revenue. These new requirements could also have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.\nWe could suffer monetary damages, incur substantial costs or be prevented from using technologies important to our products as a result of pending legal proceedings.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings arising out of our business. Because of the nature of our business, we may be subject at any particular time to commercial disputes, product liability claims, negligence claims or various other lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our business, including infringement and other licensing and intellectual property claims, distributor disputes, privacy claims, employment matters or investor matters. The lawsuits we face generally seek damages, sometimes in substantial amounts, for commercial or personal injuries allegedly suffered and can include claims for punitive or other special damages. An adverse ruling or rulings in one or more such lawsuits could, individually or in the aggregate, substantially harm our sales, results of operations and financial performance.\nThe rights we rely upon to protect the intellectual property underlying our products may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our technology, which would reduce a competitive advantage provided by our proprietary technology.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to develop or acquire commercially valuable intellectual property rights and to enforce those rights. The degree of present and future protection for our intellectual property is uncertain and may change. The risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents and other proprietary rights include the following:\n\u2022\npending patent applications we have filed, or to which we have exclusive rights, may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents;\n\u2022\npatents licensed or issued to us or our customers may not provide a competitive advantage;\n\u2022\nother parties may challenge patents or patent applications licensed or issued to us or our customers;\n\u2022\nother companies may design around technologies we have patented, licensed or developed; and\n\u2022\nall patents have a limited life, meaning at some point valuable patents will expire and we will lose the competitive advantage they provide. For example, certain patents related to our lateral flow technology expire in 2015.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. Nevertheless, these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products. If these measures do not protect our rights, third parties could access our technology and our competitive advantage in the market would be reduced. In addition, employees, consultants and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property, and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach. We also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries. For a variety of reasons, we may decide not to file for patent, copyright or trademark protection or prosecute potential infringements of our patents. Our trade secrets may also become known through other means not currently foreseen by us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, our competitors or customers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology and products without infringing any of our intellectual property rights, or design around our proprietary technologies.\nClaims by others that our products infringe their proprietary rights could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services and could increase our costs.\nSubstantial litigation over intellectual property rights exists in the professional and consumer diagnostics industries. We expect that our products and services could be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number and functionality of our products grow and as we enter new\nand different industries and markets. Third parties may have or obtain patents which our products and services or technology may actually or allegedly infringe. Any of these third parties might assert infringement claims against us. Any litigation could result in the expenditure of significant financial resources and the diversion of management\u2019s time and resources. In addition, litigation in which we are accused of infringement may result in negative publicity, have an impact on prospective customers, cause product delays, or require us to develop alternative technologies, make substantial payments to third parties or enter into royalty or license agreements, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If a successful claim of infringement were made against us and we could not develop non-infringing technology or license rights to the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost-effective basis, we may be forced to stop selling current products or abandon new products under development and we could be exposed to legal actions by our customers.\nWe may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive and, if we lose, could cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights, which would reduce our ability to compete.\nIn order to protect or enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights, we may initiate litigation or other proceedings against, or enter into negotiations or settlement discussions with, third parties. Litigation may be necessary to:\n\u2022\nassert claims of infringement;\n\u2022\nenforce licensing terms and conditions;\n\u2022\nprotect our trade secrets or know-how; or\n\u2022\ndetermine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of ourselves or others.\nWe have initiated a number of lawsuits against competitors whom we believe to be selling products that infringe our proprietary rights. These lawsuits and any other lawsuits that we initiate in the future could be expensive, take significant time and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Litigation can also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, we may provoke third parties to assert claims against us.\nIntellectual property law relating to the fields in which we operate is still evolving and, consequently, patent and other intellectual property positions in our industry are subject to change and often uncertain. We may not prevail in any of these suits or other efforts to protect our technology, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially valuable. During the course of these suits, there may be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation. If securities analysts or investors perceive any of these results to be negative, the trading prices of our securities may decline.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions.\nSince our inception, we acquired numerous businesses, including Axis-Shield in 2011, eScreen in 2012 and Epocal in 2013. While our business strategy no longer focuses on acquisitions, we may acquire other businesses in the future. The ultimate success of our acquisitions depends, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities from integrating acquired businesses or assets into our existing businesses. However, the acquisition and successful integration of independent businesses or assets is a complex, costly and time-consuming process, and the benefits we realize may not exceed the costs of the acquisition. The risk and difficulties associated with acquiring and integrating companies and other assets include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe impact of the acquisition on our financial and strategic position and reputation;\n\u2022\nconsolidating manufacturing, research and development operations and quality systems, where appropriate;\n\u2022\nintegrating newly-acquired businesses or product lines into a uniform financial reporting system;\n\u2022\ncoordinating sales, distribution and marketing functions and strategies;\n\u2022\nestablishing or expanding manufacturing, sales, distribution and marketing functions in order to accommodate newly-acquired businesses or product lines or rationalizing these functions to take advantage of synergies;\n\u2022\npreserving the important licensing, research and development, manufacturing and supply, distribution, marketing, customer and other relationships of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nminimizing the diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically separate operations; and\n\u2022\nregulatory and legal issues relating to the integration of legacy and newly-acquired businesses.\nThese factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, and managing multiple acquisitions or investments at the same time could exacerbate these risks. To the extent that we issue equity securities in connection with any acquisition or investment, existing shareholders may experience dilution. Our acquisitions have often provided for future contingent payments, or earn-outs, based on the achievement of performance targets or milestones. These arrangements can impact or restrict integration of acquired businesses and can result in disputes, including litigation. Additionally, regardless of the form of consideration we pay, acquisitions and investments could negatively impact our net income and earnings per share.\nIf goodwill or other intangible assets that we have recorded in connection with our acquisitions of other businesses become impaired, we could have to take significant charges against earnings.\nAs a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded, and may continue to record, a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets. Under current accounting guidelines, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired. In 2010 and 2011, we recorded significant goodwill impairment charges. Any further reduction or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in additional charges against earnings, which could materially reduce our reported results of operations in future periods.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with divestitures.\nSince our inception, we have, from time to time, disposed of various assets or business units, including ACS in October 2014 and our health management business in January 2015, and we are continuing to pursue potential dispositions of other non-core assets. We may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or exit opportunities on advantageous terms and in a timely manner. If we are unable to dispose of any such assets, we may shut down the related operations, which could lead to additional expenses, accounting charges, write-offs and payments to resolve outstanding contractual obligations and other claims, any of which could be material. Further, any disposition we do undertake may be subject to pre-closing conditions and approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. Any consummated disposition may also have an adverse effect on our operations or financial results that is more significant that we expect.\nDivestitures may also involve continued financial obligations with respect to the divested assets or business, including through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial\nobligations, any of which may be material. In some circumstances, some of our indemnification obligations in connection with divestitures may be unlimited in duration or amount. In addition, dispositions that provide for future contingent payments, or earn-outs, based on the achievement of performance targets or milestones can result in disputes, including litigation, and may not generate proceeds we expect to receive.\nWe may be required under the agreements governing our indebtedness to obtain the consent of our lenders to certain dispositions or to apply all or a portion of the proceeds from a disposition to the repayment of our outstanding indebtedness. If we make any future dispositions or enter into any alternative transactions, such as strategic alliances, joint ventures or other business combinations, we may be unable to structure them in a way that will enhance our creditworthiness, meet our strategic alternatives or otherwise be successful.\nWe do not have complete control over the operations of SPD, our 50/50 joint venture with P&G.\nBecause SPD is a 50/50 joint venture, we do not have complete control over its operations, including business decisions, which may impact SPD\u2019s profitability.\nAdditionally, certain subsidiaries of P&G have the right, at any time upon certain material breaches by us or our subsidiaries of our obligations under the joint venture documents, to acquire all of our interest in SPD at fair market value less any applicable damages.\nOur business has substantial indebtedness.\nWe currently have, and will likely continue to have, a substantial amount of indebtedness. Our indebtedness could, among other things, make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, require us to use a large portion of our cash flow from operations to repay and service our debt or otherwise create liquidity problems, limit our flexibility to adjust to market conditions, place us at a competitive disadvantage and expose us to interest rate fluctuations. As of December 31, 2014, we had total debt outstanding of $3.7 billion, which included $2.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our secured credit facility, consisting of \u201cA\u201d term loans (including \u201cDelayed Draw\u201d term loans) in the aggregate principal amount of $785.9 million, \u201cB\u201d term loans (including the term loans previously referred to as \u201cIncremental B-1\u201d term loans and \u201cIncremental B-2\u201d term loans, which term loans have been converted into and consolidated with the \u201cB\u201d term loans) in the aggregate principal amount of $1,330.8 million and revolving credit loans in the aggregate principal amount of $127.0 million. Our secured credit facility has various final maturity dates occurring in 2016 and 2017, subject to the possible acceleration of such maturity dates to November 15, 2015 if any of our 3% convertible senior subordinated notes remain outstanding on that date, as discussed below. At December 31, 2014, we also had $1.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our 7.25% senior notes, our 8.625% senior subordinated notes and our 6.5% senior subordinated notes, all of which mature in 2018 or 2020, as well as $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our 3% convertible senior subordinated notes, which mature in 2016.\nWe expect to obtain the money to pay our expenses and pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from our operations, dispositions of non-core assets, and potentially from debt or equity offerings. Accordingly, our ability to meet our obligations depends on our future performance and capital raising activities, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources prove inadequate to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations, restructure or refinance our debt, which we may be unable to do on acceptable terms, and forego attractive business opportunities. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives.\nThe maturity dates of our secured credit facility could be accelerated if we are unable to refinance our 3% convertible senior subordinated notes before November 15, 2015.\nOur secured credit facility has various final maturity dates occurring in 2016 and 2017, but if any of our 3% convertible senior subordinated notes remain outstanding on November 15, 2015 (subject to certain exceptions provided in the credit agreement governing our secured credit facility), our secured credit facility will instead mature on such date. We may not forcibly redeem the 3% convertible senior subordinated notes prior to their stated maturity on May 15, 2016. Accordingly, unless we are able to secure the participation of the holders of all of the 3% convertible senior subordinated notes in a tender offer for the repurchase, refinancing or other similar transaction relating to all of those notes prior to November 15, 2015 or are able to secure adequate waivers of the maturity acceleration requirement from the lenders under our secured credit facility, we may be required to repay or make arrangements to restructure or refinance the indebtedness outstanding under our secured credit facility earlier than we had expected, which we may be unable to do on acceptable terms.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness subject us to various restrictions that may limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness subject us to various restrictions on our ability to engage in certain activities, including, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nacquire other businesses or make investments;\n\u2022\nraise additional capital;\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or create liens on our assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions on our stock;\n\u2022\nrepurchase or redeem our stock or senior or subordinated debt;\n\u2022\nprepay indebtedness;\n\u2022\ndispose of assets; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nThese restrictions may limit or restrict our cash flow and our ability to pursue business opportunities or strategies that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests.\nOur secured credit facility contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants that we may not satisfy, and that, if not satisfied, could result in the acceleration of the amounts due under our secured credit facility and the limitation of our ability to borrow additional funds in the future.\nThe agreements governing our secured credit facility subject us to various financial and other restrictive covenants with which we must comply on an ongoing or periodic basis. These include covenants pertaining to maximum consolidated secured leverage ratios, minimum consolidated interest coverage ratios and limits on capital expenditures. If we violate any of these covenants, we may suffer a material adverse effect. Most notably, our outstanding debt under our secured credit facility could become immediately due and payable, our lenders thereunder could proceed against any collateral securing such indebtedness, and our ability to borrow additional funds in the future could be limited or terminated. Alternatively, we could be forced to refinance or renegotiate the terms and conditions of our secured credit facility, including the interest rates, financial and restrictive covenants and security requirements of the secured credit facility, on terms that may be significantly less favorable to us.\nA default under any of the agreements governing our indebtedness could result in a default and acceleration of indebtedness under other agreements.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement could result in a default and acceleration of our repayment obligations under other agreements. If a cross-default were to occur, we may not be able to pay our debts or borrow sufficient funds to refinance them. Even if new financing were available, it may not be available on\nacceptable terms. If some or all of our indebtedness is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations upon a change of control or fundamental change, which could limit our opportunity to enter into a change of control or fundamental change transaction.\nIf we undergo a change of control, as provided in our secured credit facility, our 7.25% senior notes, our 8.625% senior subordinated notes or our 6.5% senior subordinated notes, or a fundamental change or termination of trading, as provided in the 3% convertible senior subordinated notes, we may be required to repay or repurchase some or all of such indebtedness. We may not have sufficient financial resources to satisfy all of our repayment and repurchase obligations. Our failure to satisfy our repayment and repurchase obligations would constitute a default under the relevant indentures and under our secured credit facility and could have material adverse consequences for us and our stakeholders.\nOur operating results may fluctuate for various reasons and, as a result, period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations will not necessarily be meaningful.\nMany factors relating to our business, such as those described elsewhere in this section, make our future operating results uncertain and may cause them to fluctuate from period to period. Because our revenue and operating results are difficult to predict, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not a good indicator of our future performance. If revenue declines in a quarter, our results of operations will be harmed because many of our expenses are relatively fixed. In particular, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses are not significantly affected by variations in revenue. If our quarterly operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could drop suddenly and significantly.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of amounts that have been accrued.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and we may take certain income tax positions on our tax returns that tax authorities may disagree with. We provide reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions. However, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax regulations to our global operations in many jurisdictions. Therefore, a dispute with a tax authority may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities associated with our returns.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate. There are several proposals to reform U.S. tax rules being considered by U.S. law makers, including proposals that may reduce or eliminate the deferral of U.S. income tax on our unrepatriated earnings, potentially requiring those earnings to be taxed at the U.S. federal income tax rate, reduce or eliminate our ability to claim foreign tax credits, and eliminate various tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the U.S. In addition, as part of its base erosion and profit shifting initiative, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, has proposed a number of changes to the tax codes of its member states that are designed to address perceived tax avoidance by multinational organizations. Our future reported financial results may be adversely affected by tax rule changes which restrict or eliminate our ability to claim foreign tax credits or deduct expenses attributable to foreign earnings, or otherwise affect the treatment of our unrepatriated earnings.\nWe may incur losses in excess of our insurance coverage.\nOur insurance coverage includes product liability, property, healthcare professional and business interruption policies. Our insurance coverage contains policy limits, specifications and exclusions. We\nbelieve that our insurance coverage is consistent with general practices within our industry. Nonetheless, we may incur losses of a type for which we are not covered by insurance or which exceed the limits of liability of our insurance policies. In that event, we could experience a significant loss which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition.\nOur future success depends on our ability to recruit and retain key personnel.\nOur future success depends on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain highly-qualified personnel, including our executive officers and scientific, technical, sales and marketing employees, and their ability to manage growth successfully. Experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed. In addition, the loss of any of our key personnel, particularly key research and development personnel, could harm our business and prospects and could impede the achievement of our research and development, operation or strategic objectives.\nFuture sales of our common stock, including shares issuable upon conversion of our Series B Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, or Series B Preferred Stock, or our 3% convertible senior subordinated notes, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity securities in the public market could depress the price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. The price of our common stock could be affected by issuances of substantial numbers of shares of our common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of our Series B Preferred Stock or our 3% convertible senior subordinated notes or by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our common stock. If the conditions applicable to the conversion of our Series B Preferred Stock were satisfied, then subject to adjustment, each of the 1.8 million shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2014 could convert into 5.7703 shares of our common stock, or a total of 10.2 million shares of our common stock. Upon certain extraordinary transactions, depending on the market price of our common stock at that time, the conversion rate could increase such that significantly more shares of common stock could be issued. The $150.0 million in aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 3% convertible senior subordinated notes is convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of approximately $43.98 per share, or a total of 3.4 million shares.\nThe holders of our Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive liquidation payments in preference to the holders of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the outstanding shares of our Series B Preferred Stock had an aggregate stated liquidation preference of $709.8 million. Dividends accrue on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a rate of 3% per annum, and we have the option to pay these dividends in cash or in shares of common stock or additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock. If we pay these dividends in shares of common stock or additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock, the number of shares of common stock or Series B Preferred Stock issued will be based upon market prices at the time of such payment. Upon a liquidation of our company, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive a liquidation payment prior to the payment of any amount with respect to the shares of our common stock. The amount of this preferential liquidation payment is the aggregate stated liquidation preference, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. Because of the substantial liquidation preference to which the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled, the amount available to be distributed to the holders of our common stock upon a liquidation of our company could be substantially limited or reduced to zero.\nThe terms of the Series B Preferred Stock may limit our ability to raise additional capital through subsequent issuances of preferred stock.\nFor so long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding, we are not permitted, without the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Series B\nPreferred Stock then outstanding, to authorize or designate any class or series of capital stock having rights on liquidation or as to distributions (including dividends) senior to the Series B Preferred Stock. This restriction could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may limit the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, which may not be in your best interests.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us, even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. For example, subject to the rights of the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred stock issued, which would allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or change in control.\nIn addition, our board of directors may in the future adopt other protective measures, such as a stockholder rights plan, which could delay, deter or prevent a change in control.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 and the occurrence of this, or any other material weakness, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to report accurate financial information in a timely manner.\nOur management recently concluded that, as described under the heading \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures,\u201d we had a material weakness as of December 31, 2014 and therefore did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or effective disclosure controls and procedures, as of that date. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness related to the failure to design controls to assess the accounting for deferred tax assets which became recognizable as a result of the disposition. We are taking steps to remediate the material weakness. However, the remedial measures we are taking may not be adequate to prevent future misstatements or avoid other control deficiencies or material weaknesses. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error and the risk of fraud. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of or internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management. As a result, it is possible that our financial statements will not comply with generally accepted accounting principles, will contain a material misstatement or will not be available on a timely basis, any of which could cause investors to lose confidence in us and lead to, among other things, unanticipated legal, accounting and other expenses, delays in filing required financial disclosures, enforcement actions by government authorities, fines, penalties, the delisting of our securities and liabilities arising from stockholder litigation.", "PERMNO": 89230, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "ALR"}
