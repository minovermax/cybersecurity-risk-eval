Risk Factors\nSet forth below are certain risk factors that could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. You should carefully read the following risk factors, together with the financial statements, related notes and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that contain risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the discussion of \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d on page two of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in connection with your consideration of the risk factors and other important factors that may affect future results described below.\nRisks Related to Our Industries\nSoftware licensing models are evolving and if we are not able to make our fonts and font technologies available under these models, our business prospects could suffer.\nNew licensing and business models are evolving in the software industry. For example, as content is delivered across a variety of digital and print media, licensing models that provide flexibility across consumption platforms are being introduced. As software licensing models evolve, we may not be successful in adapting to or maintaining these new business models and our business prospects could suffer.\nWe face significant competition in various markets, and if we are unable to compete successfully, our ability to generate revenue from our business could suffer.\nWe face significant competition in the market for type and related technologies. We believe that our most significant competitive threat comes from companies that compete with some of our specific offerings. Those competitors currently include Adobe, Google, FreeType and local providers of solutions whose products are specific to a particular country\u2019s language. We also compete with the internal resources of our customers to whom we license our solutions, most of which have greater financial, technical and other resources than we do. Similarly, we also face competition from font foundries, font-related websites and independent professionals.\nSome of our current or future competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do, may enjoy greater name recognition than we do or may have more experience or advantages than we have in the markets in which they compete. These advantages may include, among others:\n\u2022\nsales and marketing advantages;\n\u2022\nthe recruitment and retention of skilled personnel;\n\u2022\nthe establishment and negotiation of profitable strategic, distribution and customer relationships;\n\u2022\nthe development and acquisition of innovative software technology and the acquisition of software companies;\n\u2022\ngreater ability to experiment with and to drive industry-wide adoption of new licensing models;\n\u2022\ngreater ability to pursue larger scale product development and distribution initiatives on a global basis;\n\u2022\nsubstantially larger patent portfolios; and\n\u2022\noperational advantages.\nFurther, many of the devices that incorporate our solutions also include technologies and fonts developed by our competitors. As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in product development in order to enhance our solutions and introduce new high-quality solutions to meet the wide variety of competitive pressures. Our ability to generate revenue from our business could suffer if we fail to do so successfully.\nCurrent and future industry standards may limit our business opportunities.\nVarious industry leaders have adopted or are in the process of adopting standards for consumer devices that incorporate, or have the potential to incorporate, our technologies. In addition, standards applicable to web-based development and distribution, such as web publishing platforms, are evolving. Although we have made some efforts, where applicable, to have our solutions adopted as industry standards, these efforts have been limited, and we do not control the ultimate decision with respect to whether our solutions will be adopted as industry standards in the future or, to the extent they are adopted, whether and for how long they will continue as such. If industry standards adopted exclude our solutions or we are unable to be compatible with such adopted solutions, we will lose market share and our ability to secure the business of customers subject to those standards will be adversely affected. Costs or potential delays in the development of our solutions to comply with such standards could significantly increase our expenses and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to others who comply faster or in a more cost efficient way or those whose solutions are adopted as the industry standard. We may also need to acquire or license additional intellectual property rights from third parties which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, and we may be required to license our intellectual property to third parties for purposes of standards compliance.\nOpen source software may make us more vulnerable to competition because new market entrants and existing competitors could introduce similar products quickly and cheaply.\nOpen source refers to the free sharing of software code used to build applications in the software development community. Individual programmers may modify and create derivative works and distribute them at no cost to the end-user. To the extent that open source software that has the same or similar functionality as our technologies is developed or gains market share, demand for our technologies may decline; we may have to reduce the prices we charge for our technologies; and our results of operations may be negatively affected. For example, as the Android operating system became more prevalent in smart phones and tablets, the opportunity to embed our technology directly into these devices declined.\nIn addition, open source type software has become more widely available and to the extent such type is widely adopted, the demand for our type offerings may decrease and our revenue could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Type, Technology and Expertise\nIf we fail to develop and deliver innovative type and technologies in response to changes in our industry, including changes in consumer tastes or trends, our revenue could decline.\nThe markets for our type, technology and expertise are characterized by rapid change and technological evolution and are intensely competitive and price sensitive. Our future success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to develop and deliver innovative type and technologies that are widely adopted in response to changes in our industry, that are compatible with the solutions introduced by other participants in our industry and for which our customers are willing to pay competitive prices. For example, as screen resolution technology improves, our offering must evolve to reflect the fact that text legibility is, in part, being addressed by these technical solutions. We rely on the introduction of new or expanded solutions with additional or enhanced features and functionality to allow us to maintain our value in the face of downward pressure on our pricing resulting from efforts by our Creative Professional and OEM customers to reduce costs. We may not correctly identify new or changing market trends at an early enough stage to capitalize on market opportunities. For example, our customers are participating in an increasingly global marketplace, and we need to ensure our global type offering and related technologies meet these needs. Our failure to deliver such innovative type and technologies that allow us to stay competitive and for which we can maintain our pricing would adversely affect our revenue.\nThe success of our business is influenced by the interoperability of our solutions with a variety of consumer devices and software applications and operating systems.\nTo be successful we must design our type and technologies to interoperate effectively with a variety of consumer devices, software applications, operating systems and content creation platforms. We depend on the cooperation of consumer device manufacturers with respect to the components integrated into their devices, such as PDLs, as well as software developers that create the operating systems and applications, to incorporate our solutions into their product offerings. Content creation platforms are evolving rapidly and our solutions must meet the needs of both authors and device manufacturer who seek to have targeted customers consume information on multiple devices. To the extent our fonts and font technologies are less relevant, are incompatible, or contain errors or defects, our business would be adversely affected.\nOur type and technologies compete with solutions offered by some of our customers, which have significant competitive advantages.\nWe face competitive risks in situations where our customers are also current or potential competitors. For example, Adobe is a significant licensee of our fonts, but Adobe is also a competitor with respect to the licensing of technologies and fonts. To the extent that Adobe or our other customers choose to utilize competing solutions they have developed or in which they have an interest, rather than utilizing our solutions, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Adobe also offers broader product lines than we do, including software products outside of the type market that provide Adobe with greater opportunities to bundle and cross-sell products to its large user base. To the extent our customers were to offer type or technologies comparable to ours at a similar or lower price, our revenue could decline and our business would be harmed.\nOur business is dependent in part on type and technologies we license from third parties and these license rights may be inadequate for our business.\nCertain of our solutions are dependent in part on the licensing and incorporation of technologies from third parties, and we license a substantial number of fonts from third parties. For example, we have\nlicense agreements with Microsoft, Adobe and others under which we license certain fonts, and our e-commerce sites, including www.myfonts.com, rely upon the license of type from third parties. Our license agreements with these parties are limited by the ownership or licensing rights of our licensors. If any of the technologies we license from third parties fail to perform as expected, if our licensors do not continue to support any of their technology or intellectual property, including fonts, because they go out of business or otherwise, or if the technologies or fonts we license are subject to infringement claims, then we may incur substantial costs in replacing the licensed technologies or fonts or fall behind in our development schedule and our business plan while we search for a replacement. In addition, replacement technology and fonts may not be available for license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which could subject us to claims by our customers for breach of the terms of our agreements with them.\nOur business and prospects depend on the strength of our brands, and if we do not maintain and strengthen our brands, we may be unable to maintain or expand our business.\nMaintaining and strengthening the brand of the Monotype Libraries and our other brands is critical to maintaining and expanding our business, as well as to our ability to enter into new markets for our type, technology and expertise. If we fail to promote and maintain these brands successfully, our ability to sustain and expand our business and enter into new markets will suffer. Maintaining and strengthening our brands will depend heavily on our ability to continue to develop and provide innovative and high-quality solutions for our customers, as well as to continue to maintain our strong online presence and relationships with third-party type and technology providers. For example, we will need to ensure our type and technologies are as relevant for the evolving digital publishing needs of our Creative Professional customers. If we fail to adapt to changing consumer preferences or if we introduce solutions that our customers or potential customers reject, the strength of our brands could be adversely affected. Further, unauthorized third parties may use our brands in ways that may dilute or undermine their strength.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, we could lose our intellectual property rights, which could negatively affect our revenue or dilute or undermine the strength of our brands.\nOur success is heavily dependent upon our ability to protect our intellectual property which includes our type and technologies. To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of United States and international patents, design registrations, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret restrictions, end user license agreements, or EULAs, and the implementation and enforcement of nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions. Despite these efforts, we may be unable to effectively protect our proprietary rights and the enforcement of our proprietary rights may be extremely costly. For example, our ability to enforce intellectual property rights in the actual design of our fonts is limited.\nWe hold patents related to certain of our rasterizer and compression technologies and registered trademarks on many of our fonts. Our patents may be challenged or invalidated, patents may not issue from any of our pending applications or claims allowed from existing or pending patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength (or may not issue in the countries where products incorporating our technology may be sold) to provide meaningful protection or be of any commercial advantage to us. Some of our patents have been and/or may be licensed or cross-licensed to our competitors. We rely on trademark protection for the names of our fonts. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and distribute our proprietary technologies and fonts. Also, many applications do not need to identify our fonts by name, such as those designs embedded in mobile telephones and set-top boxes, and therefore may not need to license trademarked fonts. We sometimes protect fonts by copyright registration but we do not always own the copyrights in fonts licensed from third parties. In addition, we cannot be certain that we will be able to enforce our copyrights against a third party who independently develops fonts even if it generates font designs identical to ours.\nOur EULA generally permits the embedding of our fonts into an electronic document only for the purpose of viewing and printing the document, but technologies, including those related to web-based fonts, may exist or may develop which allow unauthorized persons who receive such an embedded\ndocument to use the embedded font for editing the document or even to install the font into an operating system, the same as if the font had been properly licensed. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property or copying of our fonts may dilute or undermine the strength of our brands. Also, we may be unable to generate revenue from products that incorporate our type or technologies without our authorization. Monitoring unauthorized use of our solutions is difficult and expensive. A substantial portion of the consumer devices that require type or related technologies are manufactured in China. We cannot be certain that the steps we take to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property will be effective, particularly in countries like China where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.\nWe may be forced to litigate to defend our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims by third parties against us relating to intellectual property rights.\nDisputes and litigation regarding the ownership of technologies and fonts and rights associated with solutions such as ours are common, and sometimes involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence. Third parties have from time-to-time claimed, and in the future may claim, that our products and services infringe or violate their intellectual property rights. Any such claims could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages and prevent us from selling our products. We may be forced to litigate to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners pursuant to any such litigation, which could further exhaust our resources. Furthermore, as a result of an intellectual property challenge, we may be required to enter into royalty, license or other agreements, and we may not be able to obtain such agreements at all or on terms acceptable to us. We have been in the past involved in litigation with third parties, including Adobe, to defend our intellectual property rights and have not always prevailed.\nCertain component technologies in our solutions may be subject to open source licenses, which may restrict how we use or distribute our technologies or require that we release the source code of certain technologies subject to those licenses.\nCertain open source licenses, such as the GNU Lesser General Public License, require that source code subject to the license be released or made available to the public. Such open source licenses typically mandate that proprietary technologies, when combined in specific ways with open source software, become subject to the open source license. We take steps to ensure that our proprietary technologies are not combined with, or do not incorporate, open source software in ways that would require our proprietary technologies to be subject to an open source license. However, few courts have interpreted the open source licenses, and the manner in which these licenses may be interpreted and enforced is therefore subject to uncertainty. While our end-user license agreement, or EULA, prohibits the use of our technologies in any way that would cause them to become subject to an open source license, our customers could, in violation of our EULA, combine our technologies with technologies covered by an open source license.\nIn addition, we rely on multiple software engineers to design our proprietary technologies. Although we take steps to ensure that our engineers do not include open source software in the technologies they design, we may not exercise complete control over the product development efforts of our engineers and we cannot be certain that they have not incorporated open source software into our proprietary technologies. In the event that portions of our proprietary technologies are determined to be subject to an open source license, we might be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, which could reduce or eliminate our ability to commercialize our solutions. Also, our ability to market our\ntype and technologies depends in part on the existence of proprietary operating systems. If freely distributed operating systems like Linux or Android become more prevalent, the need for our solutions may diminish and our revenue could be adversely affected. Finally, in the event we develop technologies that operate under or are delivered under an open source license, such technologies may have little or no direct financial benefit to us.\nRisks Related to Our Customers and our Customer Relationships\nWe derive a substantial majority of our revenue from a limited number of licensees, and if we are unable to maintain these customer relationships or attract additional customers, our revenue will be adversely affected.\nWe derive a substantial majority of our revenue from the licensing of our type and technologies to OEMs, including ISVs, and to creative professionals who use our fonts in the content that they create. Some of our license agreements are for a limited period of time and, upon expiration of their license agreements, these customers may not renew their agreements or may elect not to enter into new agreements with us on terms as favorable as our current agreements. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, our top ten licensees by revenue accounted for approximately 35.3%, 37.2% and 41.0% of our total revenue, respectively. Accordingly, if we are unable to maintain these relationships or establish relationships with new customers, our licensing revenue will be adversely affected.\nIf standard setting industry leaders were to discontinue their use of our solutions in their products, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nBecause of their market position as industry leaders, the incorporation by Hewlett Packard, or HP, of our solutions in its laser printers and the incorporation of our solutions by Adobe in its PostScript product promote widespread adoption of our technologies by manufacturers seeking to maintain compatibility with HP and Adobe. If HP or Adobe were to stop using our solutions in their products, the market acceptance of our technologies by other consumer device manufacturers would be materially and adversely affected, and this would in turn adversely affect our revenue.\nWe face pressure from our customers to lower our license fees and, to the extent we lower them in the future, our revenue may be adversely affected.\nThe consumer device markets are highly competitive and consumer device manufacturers are continually looking for ways to reduce the costs of components included in their products in order to maintain or broaden consumer acceptance of those products. Because our type and technologies are a component incorporated into consumer devices, when negotiating renewals of customer contracts, we face pressure from our customers to lower our license fees. In addition, our Creative Professional business is increasingly comprised of recurring revenue, including SaaS subscription-based licensing models. We have in the past, and may in the future, need to lower our recurring license fees, either immediately or over time, to preserve customer relationships or extend use of our type or technologies. To the extent contractual license fees for any particular customer are lower in the future, we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve related increases in the use of our technologies or other benefits to fully offset the effects of these adjustments.\nIf we are unable to further penetrate our existing markets or adapt or develop our type or technologies, our business prospects could be limited.\nIn our Creative Professional business, we expect that our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to successfully penetrate both the desktop and digital publishing and advertising markets through our relationships with our e-commerce, business enterprise, agency and publishing customers. To date, we have penetrated only some of these markets. In our OEM business, we expect that our future\nsuccess will depend, in part, upon our ability to successfully penetrate existing markets for consumer devices, including laser printers, digital copiers, mobile devices, e-book readers, automotive displays, digital televisions, set-top boxes and consumer appliances. Our ability to grow our revenue depends upon our ability to further penetrate these markets and to successfully penetrate those markets in which we currently have no presence. Demand for our solutions in any of these developing markets may not develop or grow, and a sufficiently broad base of Creative Professional and OEM customers may not adopt or continue to use products that employ our solutions. Because of our limited experience in some of these markets, we may not be able to adequately adapt our business and our solutions to the needs of these customers.\nOur success depends on the existence of a market for consumer devices that incorporate our type and technologies.\n\u2022\nOur revenue depends in large part on market demand for solutions that enable consumer devices to render high-quality text.\nThe consumer device market is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and needs, and frequent new platform and product introductions. If the need for laser printers and other consumer devices utilizing our technology were to decrease or if current models of these products were replaced by new or existing products for which we do not have a competitive solution or if our solutions are replaced by others that become the industry standard and we are not able to develop technologies to build on such industry standards, our customers may not purchase our solutions and our revenue would be adversely affected. For example, if consumer devices evolve from text-based screens to voice controlled or gesture activated interactions, our solutions may be less relevant to the device manufacturers. Similarly, if the Android platform, for example, increases market share in the e-reader, television or automotive industries and we are not able to develop additional solutions to build on such platform, our revenue would be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nThe market for laser printers is a mature market growing at a slower rate than other markets in which we operate. To the extent that sales of laser printers level off or decline, our licensing revenue may be adversely affected.\nA significant portion of our revenue in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was derived from laser printer manufacturers. The laser printer market is a mature market and as a result, it has grown at a slower rate than other markets in which we operate. If sales of printers incorporating our solutions level off, or decline, then our licensing revenue may be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nOur licensing revenue depends in large part upon device manufacturers incorporating our type and technologies into their products, and if our solutions are not incorporated in these products or fewer products are sold that incorporate our solutions, our revenue will be adversely affected.\nOur licensing revenue from OEMs depends upon the extent to which these device manufacturers embed our type and technologies in their products. We do not control their decision whether or not to embed our solutions into their products, and we do not control their product development or commercialization efforts. If we fail to develop and offer solutions that adequately or competitively address the needs of the changing marketplace, OEMs may not be willing to embed our solutions into their products. The process utilized by OEMs to design, develop, produce and sell their products is generally 12 to 24 months in duration. As a result, if an OEM is unwilling or unable to embed our solutions into a product that it is manufacturing or developing, we may experience significant delays in generating revenue while we wait for that OEM to begin development of a new product that may embed our solutions. In addition, if OEMs sell fewer products incorporating our solutions, our revenue will be adversely affected.\nOur operating results may fluctuate based upon an increase or decrease of market share by consumer device manufacturers to whom we license our type or technologies.\nThe terms of our license agreements with our consumer device manufacturers vary. For example, we have fixed fee licensing agreements with certain customers, some of which may decline over time. If these customers, some of whom are instrumental in setting industry standards and influencing early adoption of platforms or technology incorporating our solutions, were to increase their share of the consumer device market, under the terms of these agreements there would not be a corresponding increase in our revenue. Any change in the market share of consumer device manufacturers to whom we license our type or technologies is entirely outside of our control.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nWe conduct a substantial portion of our business outside North America and, as a result, we face diverse risks related to engaging in international business.\nWe have offices in six foreign countries and we are dedicating a significant portion of our sales efforts in countries outside North America. We are dependent on international sales for a substantial amount of our total revenue. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, approximately 47.6%, 45.3% and 47.5%, respectively, of our total revenue was derived from operations outside the U.S. and we expect that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. This future international revenue will depend on the continued use and expansion of our type and technologies, including the licensing of our solutions worldwide.\nWe are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to enforce our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent that the United States does, which increases the risk of unauthorized and uncompensated use of our type or technologies;\n\u2022\nUnited States and foreign government trade restrictions, including those that may impose restrictions on importation of programming, technology or components to or from the United States;\n\u2022\nforeign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements, including foreign taxes that we may not be able to offset against taxes imposed upon us in the United States, and foreign tax and other laws limiting our ability to repatriate funds to the United States;\n\u2022\nrisks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, in particular fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Japanese yen, the European Union\u2019s euro, and the United Kingdom\u2019s pound sterling, including risks related to hedging activities we may undertake;\n\u2022\nforeign labor laws, regulations and restrictions;\n\u2022\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, natural disasters, war and/or events of terrorism; and\n\u2022\nthe strength of international economies.\nIf we have difficulty finding appropriate partnership and/or acquisition candidates, our ability to execute aspects of our strategic plan may be hindered.\nWe intend to pursue selectively complementary acquisitions, strategic partnerships, including relationships with creative agencies, and third party intellectual property licenses to accelerate our time to market, penetrate new geographies and expand our offering. Execution of our strategy relies on finding\nand closing partnerships and/or acquisitions that fit with our business and that meet our financial expectations. To the extent that we are unable to identify appropriate opportunities and close deals on acceptable financial terms, we may face hurdles in executing portions of our strategy. In addition, the pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated.\nIf we do find appropriate acquisition candidates, the acquisition process may divert our management\u2019s attention or result in additional dilution to stockholders or use of resources that are necessary to operate other parts of our business.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may seek to acquire businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. Acquisitions could create risks for us, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating acquired personnel, operations and technologies;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs or liabilities associated with such acquisitions;\n\u2022\nincurrence of acquisition-related costs;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nuse of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and\n\u2022\nuse of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate such acquisitions.\nIn addition, we could discover deficiencies withheld from us in an acquisition or otherwise not uncovered in our due diligence prior to the acquisition. These deficiencies could include problems in internal controls, product quality, customer relationships or compliance with applicable laws, any of which could result in us becoming subject to unforeseen liabilities. Moreover, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our earnings based on this impairment assessment process, which could harm our results of operations. Acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or in the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results and integrating acquired entities that have operating practices and cultures that differ from our own may hinder our ability to achieve the expected results of an acquisition. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results may suffer.\nWe rely on the manufacturers to whom we license our type and technologies to prepare accurate royalty reports for our determination of licensing revenue and if these reports are inaccurate, our revenue may be under-, or over-stated and our forecasts and budgets may be incorrect.\nOur license revenue is generated primarily from royalties and recurring revenues paid by customers who license our type and technologies. Under these arrangements, our customers typically pay us a fee based on usage of our solutions and we rely on our licensees to accurately report their usage. We calculate our license fees, prepare our financial reports, projections and budgets and direct our licensing and technology development efforts based in part on these reports. However, it is often difficult for us to independently determine whether or not our licensees are reporting accurately. We have implemented an audit program of our licensees\u2019 records, but the effects of this program may be limited as audits are generally expensive and time consuming, and initiating audits could harm our relationships with licensees. In addition, our audit rights are contractually limited. To the extent that our licensees understate or fail to report their usage of their solutions, we will not collect and recognize revenue to which we are entitled. Alternatively, we may encounter circumstances in which a customer may notify us that it previously reported inaccurate usage. In such cases, we may be required to give our licensee a credit which would result in a reduction in revenue in the period in which a credit is granted, and such a reduction could be material.\nParties from whom we license fonts or components of our technologies may challenge the basis for our calculations of the royalties due to them.\nSome of our agreements with licensors require us to give them the right to audit our calculations of royalties payable to them. In addition, licensors may at any time challenge the basis of our calculations and we cannot be sure that we will be successful in our defense. Any royalties paid as a result of any successful challenge would increase our expenses and could negatively impact our relationship with such licensor, including by impairing our ability to continue to use and re-license technologies or fonts from that licensor.\nA prolonged economic downturn could materially harm our business.\nOur ability to generate revenue is affected by the level of business activity of our Creative Professional and OEM customers, which, in most cases, is affected by the level of economic activity occurring in the industries and markets that our customers serve. Negative trends in the general economy, including trends resulting from a recession, the availability of credit, actual or threatened military action by the United States, terrorist attacks on the United States or abroad, or increased oil prices, could cause a decrease in consumer and/or business spending on computer hardware and software, and consumer devices in general, and could negatively affect the rate of growth of consumer device markets or of adoption of consumer devices. Any economic downturn, including a reduction in consumer confidence or disposable income in general, could also adversely affect the demand for fonts or impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services that they have purchased. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery and this uncertainty makes it difficult to determine if past experience is a good guide to the future. If the general economy or markets in which we operate worsen from present levels, the demand for fonts and font technologies could decline, and our revenue and profitability could be materially and adversely impacted.\nSecurity vulnerabilities in our products or systems could lead to reduced revenues or to liability claims.\nMaintaining the security of our products, computers and networks, including data centers that house our equipment and deliver our services, is an important issue for us and our customers. Unauthorized parties may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, malware and other malicious software programs that attack our products and services, our networks, or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products, services and networks. Hardware, software and applications including cloud-based solutions that we procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of the system. Because techniques used by unauthorized parties to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until long after being launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We can make no assurance that we will be able to detect, prevent, timely and adequately address, or mitigate the negative effects of cyberattacks or other security breaches, and we cannot guarantee that our systems will not be compromised, whether as a result of criminal conduct, advances in computer hacking, service disruptions, or data security incidents due to employee error, malfeasance, or other vulnerabilities. Any of these occurrences, whether intentional or accidental, could lead to interruptions, delays, or cessation of operation of our products, services and networks.\nUnauthorized parties may seek to, among other things, misappropriate, compromise or alter our intellectual property, our confidential information, or confidential information of third parties including our customers; create system disruptions or product or service vulnerabilities; or cause shutdowns. Unauthorized disclosure, misuse, loss or corruption of our data, damage or misuse of our computer systems, or the inability of our customers to access or use our systems and solutions could disrupt our operations, result in a material loss of business, expose us to substantial legal liability, and significantly harm our reputation. Potential breaches of our security measures and the accidental loss, inadvertent\ndisclosure or unauthorized dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive, personal or confidential data about us, our employees or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our employees, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability or fines for us, governmental inquiry and oversight, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. We may be required to expend significant resources to attempt to protect against security threats, enhance our security measures, or investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. If such efforts are unsuccessful, we could experience the disruption of our operations, a material loss of business, exposure to substantial legal liability and significant harm to our reputation.\nWe incur significant costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with changing laws and regulations, including those affecting public companies, which could affect our operating results.\nWe have incurred and will incur significant costs, and have and could experience internal resources constraints, associated with the evaluation of and compliance with evolving corporate governance, reporting and other requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Massachusetts data protection laws, as well as rules implemented by the SEC, and the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect that the rules and regulations applicable to us could cause our legal and financial compliance costs to increase and could make some activities more time-consuming and costly. In addition, in the current public company environment, officers and directors are subject to increased scrutiny and may be subject to increased potential liability. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers. This could negatively impact our future success.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. The revenue we generate and our operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\ndemand for consumer devices that include our solutions;\n\u2022\ndemand for our fonts and custom font design services;\n\u2022\ndelays in product shipment by our customers;\n\u2022\nindustry consolidation;\n\u2022\nintroduction, enhancement and market acceptance of type and technology offered by us and our competitors;\n\u2022\nprice reductions or business model changes by us or our competitors or changes in how type and related technologies are priced and licensed;\n\u2022\nthe mix of solutions offered by us and our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe mix of international and U.S. revenue generated by licensing our solutions;\n\u2022\nfinancial implications of acquisitions, in particular foreign acquisitions involving different accounting standards, foreign currency issues, international tax planning requirements and the like;\n\u2022\ntiming of billings to customers on royalty reports received by us under our licensing agreements; and\n\u2022\nour ability to hire and retain qualified personnel.\nA substantial portion of our quarterly revenue is based on actual shipments by our customers of products incorporating our solutions in the preceding quarter, and not on contractually agreed upon minimum revenue commitments. Because the shipping of products by our customers is outside our control and difficult to predict, our ability to accurately forecast quarterly revenue is limited. Our revenue also varies from quarter-to-quarter as a result of variances on the timing of transactions through our e-commerce websites. Quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nThe loss of members of our executive and senior management team may prevent us from executing our business strategy.\nOur future success depends in large part upon the continued services of key members of our executive and senior management team. Many of our executive officers are long-tenured and have a deep knowledge and understanding of our business. Our senior officers bring a diverse skill set to our management team, which we rely on for strategy and direction as the Company grows and diversifies. The loss of the services of any of these key employees could seriously harm our ability to execute our business strategy. Further, all of our officers are at-will employees. The loss of any of these key employees may cause us to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring, training and retaining their replacements.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel, and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel, or implement the appropriate processes and systems to support them, we may not be able to maintain our operations or grow effectively.\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals, including font designers who are recognized as leaders in the industry and experienced software engineers. These individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to us and our operations. These individuals can be terminated or can leave our employ at any time. Some of these individuals are consultants. If any of these individuals or a group of individuals were to terminate their employment unexpectedly or end their consulting relationship sooner than anticipated, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors, could incur significant costs in connection with their termination and could experience a loss in productivity while any such successor obtains the necessary training and experience.\nOur future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel and consultants for all areas of our organization to drive the execution of our strategic vision. In this regard, if we are unable to hire, train and support, with internal systems and processes, a sufficient number of qualified employees and consultants for any reason or retain employees or consultants with the required expertise, we may not be able to implement our current initiatives or grow effectively or execute our business strategy successfully.\nRisks Related to the Securities Markets and Investment in our Common Stock\nMarket volatility may affect our stock price and the value of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products, services or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies;\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in our financial guidance or securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\ndiscussion of us or our stock price by the financial press and in online investor communities;\n\u2022\ngeneral market or economic conditions, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors; and\n\u2022\nother risks and uncertainties described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d.\nMarket prices of technology companies have been extremely volatile. Stock prices of many technology companies have often fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies. In the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation. If we were involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of management from our business.\nThe structure of our current Credit Facility could affect our financing options and liquidity.\nWe have a five-year, $120.0 million secured revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) with Wells Fargo Capital Finance LLC, the administrative agent for a syndicate of Lenders. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate based upon, at the Company\u2019s option, either London Interbank Offering Rate, (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) or the base rate, plus in each case, an applicable margin. The Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants and is secured by substantially all of our assets. In the event that we draw down on the Credit Facility, it could have important consequences to our business or the holders of our common stock, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrequiring a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for other purposes; and\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may inhibit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. These provisions include a classified board of directors, a prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders and the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nWe currently pay dividends on our common stock, but there is no guarantee that this will continue.\nBeginning in the third quarter of 2012, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend to shareholders of our common stock. Future payments and record dates are subject to board approval, however if our financial or operating conditions change, or if we fail to satisfy the restrictive covenants contained in the terms of our Credit Facility that limit our ability to make dividend payments, it may affect our ability to pay dividends on a quarterly basis or at all.\nWe may require additional capital, and raising additional funds by issuing securities or additional debt financing may cause dilution to existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future. We may raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings or debt financings. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership will be diluted. Any new debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations more than our current credit facility. These restrictive covenants would likely include limitations on additional borrowing, specific restrictions on the use of our assets and our ability to pay dividends, as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens, make investments or repurchase stock.", "PERMNO": 92210, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "TYPE"}
