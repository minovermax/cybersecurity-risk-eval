{"cik": "1753706", "company": "Whole Earth Brands, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should consider carefully all of the following risk factors and all the other information contained in this report, including the financial statements. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risk factors described below are not necessarily exhaustive and you are encouraged to perform your own investigation with respect to us and our business.\nRisks Related to Our Branded Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) Segment\nCompetition, consolidation and costs may reduce sales and margins.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with companies that have greater capital resources, facilities and diversity of product lines. Increased competition for products could result in reduced volumes and/or prices, both of which would reduce our sales and margins. Our competitors may also introduce new low-calorie sweeteners and other alternatives to sugar. To the extent that current users of our products switch to other low-calorie sweeteners or sugar alternatives, there could be a decrease in the demand for our products. In addition, competitors with larger marketing budgets can influence consumer preferences. There is no assurance that Merisant\u2019s existing marketing spending is sufficient to stay competitive with other product manufacturers.\nOur margins are also under pressure from consolidation in the retail food industry in many regions of the world. In the United States, we have experienced a shift in the channels where consumers purchase our products from the higher margin retail to the lower margin club and mass merchandisers. Such consolidation may significantly increase our cost of doing business and may further result in lower sales of our products and/or lower margins on sales. In addition, increased competition from private label manufacturers of low-calorie tabletop sweeteners may have a negative impact on sales and/or margins.\nAdditionally, the success of our Branded CPG segment depends in part on our ability to manage costs and be efficient in the highly competitive tabletop sweetener industry. Inability to manage fluctuations in the price and availability of raw materials, energy, freight and other operating inputs could contribute to decreased profitability. Such fluctuations could stem alternative crops and varying local or regional harvests because of, for example, weather conditions, crop disease, climate change or crop yields. In some cases, we may not be able to pass the full increase in raw material prices, or higher energy, freight or other operating costs, on to our customers.\nRapid growth of natural sweetener products may not be sustainable and launches of new products may not be successful.\nThe rapid net sales growth experienced in our natural sweetener category may not be sustainable long term and could moderate in the coming years or quarters. In addition, adoption of the Whole Earth\u00ae, Pure Via\u00ae and Swerve\u00ae brands may be slower or cost more than has been historically experienced. New sweeteners may be introduced into the market which could impact net sales growth.\nWe must expend resources to maintain consumer awareness of our brands, build brand loyalty and generate interest in our products. Our marketing strategies and channels will evolve and our programs may or may not be successful.\nWe believe that our consumer-packaged goods are broadly known and followed in the United States and many other countries in which we operate. In order to remain competitive and expand and keep shelf placement for our products, we may need to increase our marketing and advertising spending to maintain and increase consumer awareness, protect and grow our existing market share or promote new products, which could affect our operating results. Substantial advertising and promotional expenditures may be required to maintain or improve our brand\u2019s market position or to introduce new products to the market, and participants in our industry are increasingly engaging with non-traditional media, including consumer outreach through social media and web-based channels, which may not prove successful. An increase in our marketing and advertising efforts may not maintain our current reputation, or lead to increased brand awareness. In addition, we consistently evaluate our product lines to determine whether or not to discontinue certain products. Discontinuing product lines may increase our profitability but could reduce our sales and hurt our brands, and a reduction in sales of certain products could result in a reduction in sales of other products. The discontinuation of product lines may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHealth-related allegations could damage consumer confidence in our products.\nPeriodically, claims are made regarding the safety of Artificial Sweeteners consumption. Past claims include allegations that Artificial Sweeteners lead to various health problems. Although we believe that we have been successful in presenting scientific evidence to dispute these claims and restore consumer confidence in the face of each of these claims, there can be no assurance that we will be similarly successful if health-related allegations are made in the future. If consumers lose confidence in the safety of our products, regardless of the accuracy or supportability of such claims, our sales and margins would be negatively impacted. Furthermore, actions by the FDA and other federal, state or local agencies or governments domestically or abroad may impact the acceptability of or access to certain sweeteners. For example, the FDA could ban or recall certain sweeteners for safety reasons.\nProduct liability claims or product recalls could adversely affect our business reputation.\nThe sale of food products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers. Such hazards could result from:\n\u2022tampering by unauthorized third parties;\n\u2022product contamination;\n\u2022the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals and other agents; or\n\u2022residues introduced during the manufacturing, packaging, storage, handling or transportation phases.\nSome of the products we sell are produced for us by third parties and such third parties may not have adequate quality control standards to ensure that such products are not adulterated, misbranded, contaminated or otherwise defective. In addition, we license our brands for use on products produced and marketed by third parties, for which we receive royalties. We, as well as the manufacturers of aspartame, may be subject to claims made by consumers as a result of products manufactured by these third parties which are marketed under our brand names.\nConsumption of adulterated products may cause serious health-related illnesses and we may be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even an inadvertent shipment of adulterated products is a violation of law and may lead to an increased risk of exposure to product liability claims, product recalls and increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies. Such claims or liabilities may not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution which we may have against third parties. In addition, even if a product liability claim is not successful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could have a material adverse effect on our reputation with existing and potential consumers and on our brand image, all of which could negatively impact our earnings and cash flows.\nOur Branded CPG segment may be adversely affected by concentration in our manufacturer, supplier and distributor base.\nWe currently rely upon an external manufacturer in the U.S., as well as an internal manufacturer in the Czech Republic, a number of key tollers, external manufacturers, packaging suppliers, ingredient suppliers, and 3PL (logistics) vendors globally. There are a limited number of manufacturing service suppliers, ingredient and packaging suppliers with the capability and capacity to meet our strict product requirements effectively. Failure by our external manufacturers, internal plant, ingredients or packaging suppliers to manufacture, or supply, as applicable, or our logistics vendors to transport our products, in accordance with our agreements with each supplier could result in inventory shortages. Inventory practices and redundant sourcing contingencies have been established in the event of protracted product supply interruptions; however, regulatory, manufacturing, and replenishment lead times for contingent sources could extend beyond safety stock coverage, which would have a negative impact on earnings and cash flows and impair our ability to operate our business.\nAdditionally, we use exclusive distributors in certain jurisdictions for our products. Our Branded CPG segment would suffer disruption if these distributors were to fail to perform their expected services or to effectively represent us, which could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Flavors & Ingredients Segment\nOur ability to reduce costs of operation and meet increasing customer requirements or preferences for compliance with GFSI depends on timely and successful completion of our factory reorganization project.\nBecause of changes in the volume and make-up of our Flavors & Ingredients business and the age of our Camden, New Jersey facility, we are in the process of moving certain operations from our Camden facility to our Richmond, Virginia facility and to our facilities in France and China. This will enable us to realize greater efficiencies in the manufacturing process, to reduce costs by manufacturing product at locations closer to our suppliers, and to comply with GFSI standards which are being demanded by more of our customers. Successful completion of the project depends on the ability to hire, train and retain qualified workers at the new locations, to fund equipment purchases and other investments in the facilities, and to obtain customer and other approvals. In addition, there could be significant costs and expenses incurred in connection with downsizing the Camden facility, including costs associated with the disposition of assets.\nProducts manufactured and sold by our Flavors & Ingredients segment are regulated within the U.S. market by the FDA and the principles of the Food Safety Modernization Act (\u201cFSMA\u201d). Changes to FDA requirements and increased requirements for the manufacture of food products are being addressed through the factory reorganization project undertaken by Mafco Worldwide. Such changes are being evaluated to allow for continued compliance with FDA manufacturing requirements. Changes to FSMA requirements beyond the current plans of the factory reorganization project may impact the marketability of our Flavors & Ingredients products or result in increased cost of our operations.\nOur business is dependent on sales to the worldwide tobacco industry, and negative developments and trends within the tobacco industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2020, approximately 40.9% of our Flavors & Ingredients sales and 14.5% of our consolidated net revenues were to the worldwide tobacco industry for use as tobacco flavor enhancing and moistening agents in the manufacture of American blend cigarettes, moist snuff, chewing tobacco and pipe tobacco. Changing public attitudes toward tobacco products, an increased emphasis on the public health aspects of tobacco product consumption, increases in excise and other taxes on tobacco products and an expansion of tobacco regulations in a number of countries have contributed significantly to a worldwide decline in consumption. Negative developments and trends within the tobacco industry could have a material adverse effect on our Flavors & Ingredients business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe tobacco industry has been subject to increased governmental taxation and regulation and in recent years has been subject to substantial litigation. These trends are likely to continue and it is likely that these trends will negatively affect tobacco product consumption and tobacco product manufacturers.\nProducers of tobacco products are subject to regulation in the United States at the federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries. The FDA has the power to limit the type or quantity of additives that may be used in the manufacture of tobacco products in the United States. This power has been extended to include e-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery systems (\u201cENDS\u201d). Actions by the FDA and other federal, state or local agencies or governments may impact the acceptability of or access to tobacco products, limit consumer choice as to tobacco products, delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco products, require the recall or other removal of tobacco products from the marketplace (for example, as a result of product contamination, rulemaking that bans menthol, a determination by the FDA that one or more tobacco products do not satisfy the statutory requirements for substantial equivalence, because the FDA requires that a currently-marketed tobacco product proceed through the pre-market review process or because the FDA otherwise determines that removal is necessary for the protection of public health), restrict communications to tobacco consumers, restrict the ability to differentiate tobacco products, or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business, or restrict or prevent the use of specified tobacco products in certain locations or the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments. For example, in 2020, the FDA issued a statement effectively banning certain unauthorized ENDS products containing flavors other than tobacco or menthol which had previously constituted a significant percentage of the overall revenues of that category.\nSimilarly, countries outside the United States have rules restricting the use of various ingredients in tobacco products. During 2005, the World Health Organization promulgated its Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (the \u201cFCTC\u201d). The FCTC is the first international public health treaty and establishes a global agenda for tobacco regulation in order to limit the use of tobacco products. More than 160 countries, as well as the European Union, have become parties to the FCTC. In November 2010, the governing body of the FCTC issued guidelines that provide non-binding recommendations to restrict or ban flavorings and additives that increase the attractiveness of tobacco products and require tobacco product manufacturers to disclose ingredient information to public health authorities who would then determine whether such ingredients increase attractiveness. The European Commission and individual governments are also considering regulations to further restrict or ban various cigarette ingredients. Future tobacco product regulations may be influenced by these FCTC recommendations.\nOver the years, there has been substantial litigation between tobacco product manufacturers and individuals, various governmental units and private health care providers regarding increased medical expenditures and losses allegedly caused by use of tobacco products. Some of this litigation has been settled through the payment of substantial amounts to various state governments, and United States cigarette companies significantly increased the wholesale price of cigarettes in order to recoup a portion of the settlement cost. Cigarette companies have also sought to offset the cost of these payments by changing product formulations and introducing new products with decreased ingredient costs. There may be an increase in health-related litigation against the tobacco industry, and it is possible that Mafco Worldwide, as a supplier to the tobacco industry, may become a party to such litigation. This litigation, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our Flavors & Ingredients business.\nThe tobacco business, including the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, has been subject to federal, state, local and foreign excise taxes for many years. In recent years, federal, state, local and foreign governments have increased such taxes as a means of both raising revenue and discouraging the consumption of tobacco products. New proposals to increase taxes on tobacco products are also regularly introduced in the United States and foreign countries. Additional taxes may lead to an accelerated decline in tobacco product sales. Tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of tobacco products through lower consumption levels.\nWe are unable to predict whether there will be additional price or tax increases for tobacco products or the size of any such increases, or the effect of other developments in tobacco regulation or litigation or consumer attitudes on further declines in the consumption of either tobacco products containing licorice extract or on sales of licorice extract to the tobacco industry. Further material declines in sales to the tobacco industry are likely to have a significant negative effect on the financial performance of our Flavors & Ingredients business.\nChanges in, or interpretations of, regulations regarding licorice or its components may reduce our sales and profits.\nRestrictions on certain licorice components vary worldwide, as countries, or states may have varying limits on specific components. Regulations issued by the European Chemicals Agency, the FDA, U.S. Department of Agriculture, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (Proposition 65) or other agencies may impact the potential markets for our Flavors & Ingredients products. As further research is conducted on raw materials and testing technology and capabilities increase, additional items may be identified within the natural licorice matrix which may be a source for limitation of application of our Flavors & Ingredients products.\nOur Flavors & Ingredients products are currently marketed as natural flavors in the U.S. and other major markets. As the definition of \u201cnatural\u201d varies throughout the world, changes in worldwide governmental regulatory agency definitions of natural may impact the potential market for our Flavors & Ingredients products.\nEuropean Union regulators are currently evaluating the health effects of 15 ingredients, including licorice, used in tobacco products, and are scheduled to recommend in May 2021 whether the use of any of these ingredients should be reduced or eliminated in cigarettes sold in the European Union. An adverse recommendation with respect to licorice may have a negative impact on our revenues and operations in Europe, to the extent that new restrictions are imposed by the European Union or its member states on the use of licorice in tobacco products manufactured or sold in the European Union or such member states.\nCompetition and consolidation in the functional ingredients industry may reduce our sales and profit margins.\nOur Flavors & Ingredients segment competes in a highly-competitive industry with companies that manufacture products which perform functions similar to our products and that have greater capital resources, facilities and diversity of product lines. Increased competition as to our Flavors & Ingredients products could result in decreased demand for our products, reduced volumes and/or prices, each of which would reduce our sales and margins and have a material adverse effect on our Flavors & Ingredients business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Flavors & Ingredients customers are under pressure to reduce costs, which could cause them to reformulate their products and substitute cheaper ingredients for our Flavors & Ingredients products. In addition, the ingredients industry is undergoing consolidation, which could enable our customers to negotiate lower prices for our Flavors & Ingredients products. These customer and industry pressures may result in lower sales of our Flavors & Ingredients products and/or lower margins on our Flavors & Ingredients sales.\nMany of our employees belong to labor unions, and strikes, work stoppages and other labor disturbances could adversely affect our operations and could cause our costs to increase.\nMafco Worldwide is a party to collective bargaining agreements with respect to its employees. The Camden, New Jersey agreement expires in September 2021. The Richmond, Virginia facility agreement expired in December 2020 and is not being renewed. Disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate an acceptable contract upon expiration of the existing contracts could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers. If the unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, or other employees were to become unionized or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated, our Flavors & Ingredients business could experience a significant disruption of its operations and higher ongoing labor costs. In addition, our collective bargaining agreements and labor laws may impair our ability to reduce labor costs by streamlining existing manufacturing facilities and in restructuring our Flavors & Ingredients business because of limitations on personnel and salary changes and similar restrictions.\nChanges in our relationships with our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our Flavors & Ingredients business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate a complex supply chain which is critical to our Flavors & Ingredients operations. In the event of disruption, the operations risk carrying inadequate supplies to meet customer demand. If we are unable to manage our supply chain efficiently, our operating costs could increase and our profit margins decrease.\nOur Flavors & Ingredients business is dependent on our relationships with suppliers of licorice raw materials (which includes licorice root, intermediary licorice extract and licorice derivatives). Licorice is derived from the roots of the licorice plant, a shrub-like leguminous plant that is indigenous to the Middle East and Central Asia. The licorice raw materials we purchase originates in Afghanistan, the Peoples\u2019 Republic of China, Pakistan, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Georgia, Armenia, Russia and Turkey. During 2020, one of our suppliers of licorice raw materials supplied approximately 31% of our total licorice raw materials purchases. Mafco Worldwide has an exclusive supply arrangement with a manufacturer of licorice extract and crude derivatives in Uzbekistan. The agreement expires in October 2025 and gives Mafco Worldwide the right to purchase all of the licorice products manufactured at the facility. Mafco Worldwide agreed to purchase a certain minimum amount of licorice products each year during the term and to assist in funding the purchase of raw materials inventory to be used in manufacturing product, with the timing of such funding at Mafco Worldwide\u2019s discretion. The price of the products is determined according to a pricing formula, taking into account the cost of raw materials and the product yield. The licorice products must meet quality specifications set forth in the agreement. Although alternative sources of licorice raw materials are available to Mafco Worldwide, Mafco Worldwide could incur higher costs if the supplier is unable to produce sufficient quantities of licorice raw materials at the quality levels required by Mafco Worldwide. In addition, operations in Uzbekistan could be disrupted for reasons beyond our supplier\u2019s control, such as political or economic instability or changes in government policies or regulations. If any material licorice raw materials supplier modifies its relationship with Mafco Worldwide, such a loss, reduction or modification could have a material adverse effect on our Flavors & Ingredients business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFluctuations in costs of licorice root and intermediary licorice extract could have a material adverse effect on our Flavors & Ingredients business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe price of licorice raw materials moderately decreased in 2020 from 2019. The price of licorice raw materials is affected by many factors, including monetary fluctuations and economic, political and weather conditions in countries where our flavors and ingredients suppliers are located. Although Mafco Worldwide often enters into purchase contracts for these products, significant or prolonged increases in the prices of licorice raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our Flavors & Ingredients business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with economic, climatic or political instability in countries in which we source licorice root and intermediary licorice extract.\nWe purchase licorice raw materials from suppliers in Afghanistan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Pakistan, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Georgia, Armenia, Russia and Turkey. Producers of intermediary licorice extract are located primarily in the People\u2019s Republic of China, Iraq and Central Asia. Our wholly-owned derivative manufacturing facilities, the primary source of our licorice derivatives, are located in the People\u2019s Republic of China. These countries and regions have, from time to time, been subject to political instability, corruption and violence. Economic, climatic or political instability, government intervention or civil unrest in these countries and regions could result in reduced supply, material shipping delays, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, customs duties, tariffs and import or export quotas, embargos, sanctions, significant increases in the cost of energy, significant raw material price increases or exposure to liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or under regulations promulgated by U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) and could have a material adverse effect on our Flavors & Ingredients business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, military action as well as continuing threats of terrorist attacks and unrest, have caused instability in the world\u2019s financial and commercial markets and have significantly increased political and economic instability in some of the countries and regions from which our raw materials originate. Acts of terrorism and threats of armed conflicts in or around these countries and regions could adversely affect our Flavors & Ingredients business, results of operations and financial condition in ways we cannot predict at this time.\nAny failure to maintain the quality of our manufacturing processes or raw materials could harm our operating results.\nThe manufacture of our Flavors & Ingredients products is a multi-stage process that requires the use of high-quality materials and manufacturing technologies. We are dependent on our suppliers to provide licorice raw materials meeting our quality standards. In spite of stringent quality controls, weaknesses in process control or minute impurities in materials may cause a substantial percentage of a product in a lot to be defective. If we were not able to maintain our manufacturing processes or to maintain stringent quality controls, or if contamination problems arise, the operating results of our Flavors & Ingredients business would be harmed.\nOur Flavors & Ingredients segment is subject to risks related to weather, disease and pests that could adversely affect our business.\nLicorice production is subject to a variety of agricultural risks. Extreme weather conditions, disease and pests can materially and adversely affect the quality and quantity of licorice produced. We maintain large inventories of raw material stock as part of our operating plan. The stability of licorice raw materials is dependent upon the ability of the product to remain dry and free of infestation. Increased governmental restrictions on the application of pesticides or fumigants could reduce our ability to maintain long-term storage of licorice root or result in increased cost of operations. A sustained supply interruption could have a material adverse effect on our Flavors & Ingredients business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur failure to accurately forecast and manage inventory could result in an unexpected shortfall of our Flavors & Ingredients products, which could harm our business.\nWe monitor our inventory levels based on our own projections of future demand. Because of the length of the supply chain cycle and the time necessary to produce licorice products, we must make production decisions well in advance of sales. An inaccurate forecast of demand can result in the unavailability of licorice products in high demand. This unavailability may negatively impact sales volumes and adversely affect customer relationships. Furthermore, from time to time, changes in manufacturing processes or in customer demand may cause certain inventory to become obsolete or require substantial reserves.\nThe imposition of tariffs by the United States and other countries could have a material adverse effect on our Flavors & Ingredients business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe import licorice raw materials from various countries and exports products from the U.S., France and China. The imposition of tariffs by a country from which we import goods or to which it exports goods could result in increased costs of production and higher prices and reduced demand for our Flavors & Ingredients products.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and consequent travel and other restrictions could adversely affect our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to create challenging and unprecedented conditions, and we continue our commitment to supporting the global response to the crisis. Although there are effective vaccines for COVID-19 that have been approved for use, distribution of the vaccines has only recently started and a majority of the public globally will likely not have access to a vaccination until sometime later in 2021 or 2022. Accordingly, there remains significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. We are extremely proud of our employees who are doing a tremendous job under difficult circumstances ensuring we supply the products our customers and consumers want. We have been pleased with our preparation and efforts through the pandemic and believe we remain well-positioned for the future as we continue to navigate the crisis and prepare for an eventual return to a more normal operating environment. To date, we have successfully implemented contingency plans overseen by our global leadership team to monitor the evolving needs of our global business.\nFrom the outset of the pandemic, our first priority has been the well-being of our employees and consumers. We have consistently met or exceeded government guidelines for addressing the health and safety of our employees, including global travel restrictions, prohibitions against visitors, social distancing requirements, the use of thermal temperature scanners, and the provision of personal protective equipment to our employees. We have also enabled the use of new technology to allow many of our office-based employees to work from home effectively.\nWe may face operational challenges as well as potential increased operating costs in manufacturing our products and making them available to customers and consumers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Shelter-in-place and social distancing behaviors, which are being mandated or encouraged by governments and practiced by businesses and individuals, create challenges for our manufacturing employees as well as for third parties on which we rely to make our products available to consumers. These third parties include our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, logistics providers and other business partners, retailers that ultimately sell our Branded CPG products to consumers and customers of our Flavors and Ingredients business.\nTo date, consumer behaviors that have resulted from COVID-19 have increased overall demand for our Branded CPG products sold via retail or e-commerce channels. This demand has been partially offset by lower demand for Branded CPG products in the food service channel, working capital reductions by distributors and retailers in emerging markets and temporary impacts on demand for our Flavors and Ingredients products driven by disruptions in our customers\u2019 supply chains or logistics networks.\nWhile we have experienced a net increase in the overall demand for our products during the COVID-19 pandemic, the continued duration of that increased demand environment is uncertain. Additionally, deteriorating economic conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, or future pandemics, could adversely affect future demand for our products. Factors such as increased unemployment, decreases in disposable income and declines in consumer confidence could cause a decrease in demand for our overall product set, particularly higher priced products.\nIf we fail to successfully implement our growth strategies on a timely basis, or at all, our ability to increase our revenue and operating profits could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future success depends, in large part, on our ability to implement our growth strategies effectively. However, we may not succeed in implementing our growth strategies effectively. As a multi-brand business, we face increased complexities and greater uncertainty with respect to consumer trends and demands than as a single-brand business. Our ability to successfully expand our consumer packaged goods and ingredients brands and other growth strategies depends on, among other things, our ability to identify, and successfully cater to, new demographics and consumer trends, develop new and innovative products, identify and acquire additional product lines and businesses, secure shelf space in grocery stores, wholesale clubs and other retailers, increase consumer awareness of our brands, enter into distribution and other strategic arrangements with third-party retailers and other potential distributors of our products, and compete with numerous other companies and products. We may not be successful in reaching and maintaining the loyalty of new consumers to the same extent, or at all, as we have with our historical consumers. If we are unable to identify and capture new audiences and demographics, our ability to successfully integrate additional brands will be adversely affected. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategies, expand our brands, or continue to maintain growth in our sales at our current rate, or at all. If we fail to implement our growth strategies or if we invest resources in growth strategies that ultimately prove unsuccessful, our sales and profitability may be negatively affected, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in consumer preferences could decrease our revenues and cash flow.\nWe are subject to the risks of evolving consumer preferences and nutritional and health-related concerns. To the extent that consumer preferences evolve away from low-calorie tabletop sweeteners, there will be a decreased demand for our Branded CPG products. Consumer perception that there are low-calorie tabletop sweetener alternatives that are healthier or more natural could decrease demand for such products. Any shift in consumer preferences away from our Branded CPG products, including any shift in preferences from aspartame-based products or stevia-based products to other low-calorie tabletop sweetener products could significantly decrease our revenues and cash flows and impair our ability to operate our Branded CPG business segment.\nA portion of our Flavors & Ingredients revenues are derived from the sale of licorice to worldwide confectioners. To the extent that consumer preferences shift away from licorice-flavored candy, operating results relating to the sale of licorice to worldwide confectioners could be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a portion of our revenues are derived from the sale of licorice derivatives to food processors for use as flavoring or masking agents, including our Magnasweet\u00ae brand products, which are used in various brands of chewing gum, lip balm, energy bars, non-carbonated beverages, chewable vitamins, aspirin, and other products and can be identified in the United States as a natural flavor. To the extent that consumer preferences evolve away from products that use licorice derivatives, operating results relating to the sale of licorice derivatives could be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are heavily dependent on certain customers for a significant percentage of our net revenues.\nThe loss of or disruptions related to significant customers could result in a material reduction in sales or change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer. In 2020, our top five Branded CPG customers accounted for approximately 20.5% of our Branded CPG net revenues. In 2020, our ten largest Flavors & Ingredients customers, three of which are manufacturers of tobacco products, accounted for approximately 55.0% of our Flavors & Ingredients net revenues. In 2020, one of our top European tobacco licorice extract customers, which represented approximately 4.3% of our Flavors & Ingredients revenue in 2019, materially reduced its business with us. There can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past. This could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Business is subject to transportation risks.\nAn extended interruption in our ability to ship or distribute products could have a material adverse effect on our Branded CPG and our Flavors & Ingredients segments, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot be sure that we would be able to transport or distribute our products by alternative means if it were to experience an interruption due to strike, natural disasters, epidemics or pandemics, political conflict, civil unrest or otherwise, in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nOur Business may be adversely affected by conditions in the countries where we operate.\nWe operate in many countries throughout the world. Economic and political changes in the countries where we market and produce our products, such as inflation rates, recession, foreign ownership restrictions, restrictions on transfer of funds into or out of a country and similar factors may adversely affect our results of operations. The imposition of tariffs by the United States and other countries could have a material adverse effect on our Branded CPG and Flavors & Ingredients segments, financial condition and operations.\nNegative information, including inaccurate information, about us on social media may harm our reputation and brand, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar channels that provide individuals with access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. The availability of information on social media platforms is virtually immediate, as is its effect. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. The opportunity for dissemination of information, including inaccurate information, is potentially limitless. Information concerning our business and/or products may be posted on such platforms at any time. Negative views regarding our products and the efficacy of our products have been posted on various social media platforms, may continue to be posted in the future, and are out of our control. Regardless of their accuracy or authenticity, such information and views may be adverse to our interests and may harm our reputation and brand. The harm may be immediate without affording an opportunity for redress or correction. Ultimately, the risks associated with any such negative publicity cannot be eliminated or completely mitigated and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOn January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) withdrew from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d), commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d On December 24, 2020, the U.K. and the E.U. agreed to a trade and cooperation agreement (the \u201cTrade and Cooperation Agreement\u201d), which will enter into force on the first day of the month following that in which the U.K. and the E.U. have notified each other that they have completed their respective internal requirements and procedures for establishing their consent to be bound. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement took provisional effect from January 1, 2021 (provisional application shall cease on the earlier of the date the agreement enters into force or April 30, 2021) and provided for, among other things, zero-rate tariffs and zero quotas on the movement of goods between the U.K. and the E.U.\nWe have operations in the U.K. related to our Branded CPG segment. Changes resulting from Brexit could subject our Branded CPG segment to increased risk, including changes in regulatory oversight, disruptions to supply, increases in prices, fees, taxes or tariffs on goods that are sold between the E.U. and the U.K. and difficulty staffing.\nDue to the size and importance of the economy of the U.K., the uncertainty and unpredictability concerning the\nU.K.\u2019s future laws and regulations (including financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, immigration laws and employment laws) as well as its legal, political and economic relationships with Europe following its exit from the E.U. may continue to be a source of instability in international markets, create significant currency fluctuations or otherwise adversely affect trading agreements or similar cross-border cooperation arrangements (whether economic, tax, fiscal, legal, regulatory or otherwise) for the foreseeable future. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on the implementation of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and any future agreements (or lack thereof) between the U.K. and the E.U. and, in particular, any potential changes in the arrangements for the U.K. to retain access to E.U. markets. Brexit could result in adverse economic effects across the U.K. and Europe, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Additionally, Brexit may cause fluctuations in the value of the U.K. pound sterling and E.U. euro. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our expenses, earnings, cash flows, results of operations, and revenues.\nOur international operations involve the use of foreign currencies, which subjects us to exchange rate fluctuations and other currency risks.\nThe revenues and expenses of our international operations generally are denominated in local currencies, which subject us to exchange rate fluctuations between such local currencies and the U.S. dollar. These exchange rate fluctuations subject us to currency translation risk with respect to the reported results of our international operations, as well as to other risks sometimes associated with international operations. In the future, we could experience fluctuations in financial results from our operations outside of the United States, and there can be no assurance we will be able, contractually or otherwise, to reduce the currency risks associated with our international operations.\nInability to protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights could damage our competitive position.\nAny infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property could damage its value and limit our ability to compete. We rely on copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property. We may have to engage in litigation to protect our rights to our intellectual property, which could result in significant litigation costs and require significant amounts of management\u2019s time.\nWe do not own any issued patents relating to any of our products, but we do have a number of patent applications currently pending. Certain naturally occurring materials may not, themselves, be eligible for patent protection.\nIf other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights, the value of our brands in the marketplace may be diluted. In addition, any infringement of our intellectual property rights would likely result in a commitment of our time and resources to protect these rights through litigation or otherwise. One or more adverse judgments with respect to these intellectual property rights could negatively impact our ability to compete and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe believe that the formulas and blends for our products are trade secrets. We rely on security procedures and confidentiality agreements to protect this proprietary information; however, such agreements and security procedures may be insufficient to keep others from acquiring this information. Any such dissemination or misappropriation of this information could deprive us of the value of our proprietary information.\nFurther, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries may be inadequate. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our technologies and proprietary information may increase. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise violating our technology and intellectual property.\nIf we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business, we may incur significant fines and penalties.\nOur facilities and products are subject to laws and regulations administered by the FDA, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food products. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to administrative penalties and injunctive relief, civil remedies, including fines, injunctions and recalls of our products. Our operations are also subject to regulations administered by the Environmental Protection Agency and other state, local and foreign governmental agencies. Failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity. Any environmental or health and safety legislation or regulations enacted in the future, or any changes in how existing or future laws or regulations are enforced, administered or interpreted, as well as any material cost incurred in connection with liabilities or claims from these regulations may lead to an increase in costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our consolidated financial conditions, results of operations and/or liquidity.\nPersonal data, including personal data of our customers and employees, is increasingly subject to legal and regulatory protections around the world, which vary widely in approach. We risk exposure to potential liabilities and costs resulting from the compliance with, or any failure to comply with, applicable legal requirements. Our business could be materially adversely affected by our inability, or the inability of our vendors who receive personal data from us, to comply with legal obligations regarding the use of personal data.\nIn addition to the possible fines and penalties discussed above, changes in laws and regulations in domestic and foreign jurisdictions, including changes in food and drug laws, accounting standards, taxation requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations) and environmental laws could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe countries in which we operate and from which we purchase raw materials could result in exposure to liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or under regulations promulgated by OFAC. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to administrative penalties and injunctive relief, civil remedies, including fines, injunctions and product recalls. The complexity of the many laws and regulations applicable to our business and the cost of compliance increases our costs of operations compared to some foreign competitors which are subject to less regulation.\nAny acquisitions, partnerships or joint ventures that we enter into could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of businesses, including partnerships or joint ventures with third parties. We may not be successful in identifying acquisition, partnership and joint venture candidates. In addition, we may not be able to continue the operational success of such businesses or successfully finance or integrate any businesses that we acquire or with which we form a partnership or joint venture. We may have potential write-offs of acquired assets and/or an impairment of any goodwill recorded as a result of acquisitions. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition may divert management\u2019s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations or may result in conflicts with our business. Any acquisition, partnership or joint venture may not be successful, may reduce our cash reserves, may negatively affect our earnings and financial performance and, to the extent financed with the proceeds of debt, may increase our indebtedness. We cannot ensure that any acquisition, partnership or joint venture we make will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including intellectual property, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, cause us to incur significant expenses or liability or require us to change our business practices. Because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we believe that we have meritorious claims or defenses. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot give any assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect results of our operations and our effective tax rate.\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions, including the United States, may be subject to change. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, we may be subject to income tax audits by various tax jurisdictions. Although we believe our income tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles, an adverse resolution by one or more taxing authorities could have a material impact on the results of our operations.\nStock repurchases could increase the volatility of the trading price of our common stock and diminish our cash reserves, and we cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase plan will enhance long-term stockholder value.\nIn September 2020, our board of directors adopted a stock repurchase plan for up to $20 million of our common stock. The stock repurchase plan is currently expected to have a term of up to 12 months. The shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, or by other means in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased under the plan will be determined by management and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements, compliance with the terms of our outstanding indebtedness, alternate uses for capital and other factors.\nRepurchases of our shares could increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock, which could have a negative impact on the trading price of our stock. Similarly, the future announcement of the termination or suspension of the stock repurchase plan, or our decision not to utilize the full authorized repurchase amount under the stock repurchase plan, could result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, the stock repurchase plan could have the impact of diminishing our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance our growth, complete acquisitions and execute our strategic plan. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases we do elect to make will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased our shares. Although our stock repurchase plan is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, we cannot guarantee that it will do so and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the effectiveness of the stock repurchase plan.\nWe face risks associated with our defined benefit pension plan obligations.\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan that covers approximately 9% of our employees, which was frozen as of December 31, 2019. While the risk could be minimized for a frozen defined benefit pension plan, a deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from poor market performance, a general financial downturn or otherwise could cause an increase in the amount of contributions we are required to make to the plan. For example, our defined benefit pension plan may from time to time move from an overfunded to underfunded status driven by decreases in plan asset values that may result from changes in long-term interest rates and disruptions in U.S. or global financial markets. Additionally, historically low interest rates coupled with poor market performance would have the effect of decreasing the funded status of the plan which would result in greater required contributions.\nWe may be exposed to the threat of cyber-attacks and/or data breaches.\nCybersecurity breaches of our or third-party systems, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks such as hacking, phishing attacks, computer viruses, ransomware or malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions may cause confidential information belonging to us or our employees, customers, consumers, partners, suppliers, or governmental or regulatory authorities to be misused or breached. When risks such as these materialize, the need for us to coordinate with various third-party service providers and for third party service providers to coordinate amongst themselves might increase challenges and costs to resolve related issues.\nCyber-attacks can vary in scope and intent from economically driven attacks to malicious attacks targeting our key operating systems with the intent to disrupt, disable or otherwise cripple our Branded CPG and Flavors & Ingredients segments. This can include any combination of phishing attacks, malware and/or viruses targeted at our key systems. The breadth and scope of this threat has grown over time, and the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks, as well as the sources and targets of the attacks, change frequently. While we invest time, effort and capital resources to secure our key systems and networks, we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing or responding to all such attacks.\nA successful cyber-attack may target us directly, or may be the result of a third party\u2019s inadequate care. In either scenario, we may suffer damage to our key systems and/or data that could interrupt our operations, adversely impact our reputation and brands and expose us to increased risks of governmental investigation, litigation and other liability, any of which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, responding to such an attack and mitigating the risk of future attacks could result in additional operating and capital costs in systems technology, personnel, monitoring and other investments.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and we may incur additional debt.\nIn connection with the Business Combination, on June 25, 2020, we entered to into a senior secured credit facility, which was amended on September 4, 2020, and further amended and restated on February 5, 2021 (as discussed under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d). The total indebtedness under the credit facility as of December 31, 2020 was $180 million, net of unamortized discounts. The obligations under our credit facilities are guaranteed by certain direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries of the Company, other than certain excluded subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, immaterial subsidiaries and foreign subsidiaries. Our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of the personal property of the Company and the guarantor subsidiaries (in each case, subject to certain exclusions and qualifications).\nWe are also permitted, under the terms of our credit facilities, to incur additional indebtedness, both under our credit facilities and otherwise. If such additional indebtedness is incurred, we may exacerbate the risks of our indebtedness described herein.\nOur substantial indebtedness could:\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to payments in respect of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, potential acquisition opportunities, a level of marketing necessary to maintain the current level of sales and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022increase the amount of interest that we have to pay, because some of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which will result in higher interest payments if interest rates increase, and, if and when we are required to refinance any of our indebtedness, an increase in interest rates would also result in higher interest costs;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022require refinancing, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, competition and/or changes in our business or the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds;\n\u2022restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or necessary divestitures, introducing new brands and/or products or exploiting business opportunities; and\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and/or more financial resources.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which may be affected by the other risk factors described herein. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all. Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, and could negatively impact our ability to satisfy our debt obligations.\nOur credit facilities contain financial and other covenants. The failure to comply with such covenants could have an adverse effect.\nOur credit facilities as contemplated by the credit facilities documents contain certain financial and other covenants, including a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio equal to or less than 4.00:1.00 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio equal to or greater than 1.25:1.00, and limitations on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness and make guarantees; incur liens on assets; engage in mergers or consolidations, dissolutions or other fundamental changes; sell assets; pay dividends and distributions or other restricted payments or repurchase stock; make investments, loans and advances, including acquisitions; amend organizational documents or other material agreements; enter into certain agreements that would restrict our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; repay certain junior, unsecured or subordinated indebtedness; issue certain equity; engage in certain activities; and engage in certain transactions with affiliates, in each case, subject to customary exceptions materially consistent with credit facilities of such type and size. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of our credit facilities may result in an event of default under the credit facilities. Our contemplated credit facilities bear interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flow.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nThe price of our common stock and warrants and may be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock as well as our warrants may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, regardless of our operating performance, including:\n\u2022changes in the industries in which we and our customers operate;\n\u2022developments involving our competitors;\n\u2022variations in our operating performance and the performance of our competitors in general;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022publication of research reports by securities analysts about us or our competitors or our industry;\n\u2022the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022additions and departures of key personnel;\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving the combined company;\n\u2022changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022the volume of shares of our common stock available for public sale; and\n\u2022general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations, corruption, political instability and acts of war or terrorism.\nIn the past, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their shares. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisks Related to the Business Combination\nWe may have tax consequences and other liabilities as a result of the Business Combination.\nWe cannot provide assurance that the due diligence conducted in relation to Merisant and MAFCO identified all material issues or risks associated with the Branded CPG or Flavors & Ingredients business or the industry in which they compete. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that factors outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be exposed to liabilities and incur additional costs and expenses and we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in us reporting losses. Even if our due diligence had identified certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. If any of these risks materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities.\nAs a result of the Business Combination, we inherited the historic liabilities of Merisant and MAFCO including their historic tax liabilities. To the extent that there is any liability for historic tax exposure of any of the companies acquired through the Business Combination, this exposure can impact the value of our securities. Such exposure could also impact our tax liability for future years. As a part of the Business Combination we have negotiated certain indemnities for historic tax liabilities, however, these indemnities do not cover all potential historical tax liabilities.\nThe historical financial results of Merisant and MAFCO may not be indicative of what our actual financial position or results of operations would have been.\nThe historical financial results of Merisant and MAFCO included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K do not reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows they would have achieved as a standalone company during the periods presented or those we will achieve in the future. For example, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, additional ongoing costs as a result of the Business Combination, including costs related to public company reporting, investor relations and compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Therefore, it may be difficult for investors to compare our future results to historical results or to evaluate our relative performance or trends in our segments.", "PERMNO": 18642, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "FREE"}
