{"cik": "1442236", "company": "Quest Resource Holding Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-17", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and future prospects could be seriously harmed. This could cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline and result in the loss of all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have incurred historical net losses and could have net losses in the future as we take steps to expand our business, which may negatively impact our ability to achieve our business objectives.\nWhile we reported net income in 2020 and 2021, as a result of historical operating losses, we had an accumulated deficit of $96,708,981 as of December 31, 2021. We expect to continue to make significant expenditures and incur substantial expenses as we continue to develop our business, expand our customer base, expand the recycling services we offer, increase the types of materials covered by our recycling services, enhance our technologies, implement internal systems and infrastructure, and hire additional personnel. As a result, we may incur losses as we expand our business. There is no assurance that we will maintain profitability in the\nnear future or at all. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability depends on a number of factors, including the pricing of our services, market acceptance of our services, and other factors, some of which are set forth under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d or are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we incur substantial losses and are unable to secure additional financing, we could be forced to discontinue or curtail our business operations; sell assets at unfavorable prices; refinance existing debt obligations on terms unfavorable to us; or merge, consolidate, or combine with a company with greater financial resources in a transaction that may be unfavorable to us.\nOur business depends to a certain extent upon our largest customers, and any material reduction in our business with those customers could have an adverse effect on our company.\nThe success of our business depends to a certain extent on our relationship with our largest customers. Any material reduction in the business we do with those customers could have an adverse effect on our company. Two customers accounted for 38% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, and three customers accounted for 51% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our contractual arrangements with our major customers generally are on a multi-year basis and pertain to the management of only certain forms of materials. Our failure to maintain our business with our largest customers or any other large customer could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAlthough we have long-term relationships with many of the customers to which we provide recycling services, their ability to cancel, reduce, or delay our service offerings to them could reduce our revenue and increase our costs.\nAlthough customers for our services, including our largest customers, generally enter into multi-year contracts, typically from two to three years, they do not typically provide us with firm, long-term volume commitments. As a result, our customers are able to cancel, reduce, or delay our services to them at any time. If our service offerings are cancelled, delayed, or reduced, our revenue would decline.\nWe may lose a substantial portion of our recycling services business if certain materials are classified as \u201cwaste.\u201d\nSome of the municipalities in which we provide services for certain customers have entered into contractual arrangements with their waste haulage companies that require them to permit those waste haulage companies to remove and dispose of \u201cwaste\u201d or \u201csolid waste\u201d within those municipalities. If materials, and in particular organic materials, that we typically obtain and dispose of are considered \u201cwaste\u201d or \u201csolid waste,\u201d then our customers may be required to allow the waste haulage companies to remove those materials, and in general either our customers or the municipalities in which they are located must compensate those waste haulage companies based on the metric set forth in the relevant contracts or franchise agreements with those waste haulage companies. If, however, the materials are classified as \u201craw material,\u201d as \u201ccommodities,\u201d or as another designation other than \u201cwaste\u201d or \u201csolid waste,\u201d our customers may allow us to obtain the recyclable materials. If it is ultimately found that certain materials constitute \u201cwaste\u201d or \u201csolid waste,\u201d a significant portion of our anticipated revenue stream could be lost, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, the growth of our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTo expand our recycling and waste services business, we must attract additional customers and expand the services we offer.\nAlthough we plan to increase our recycling and waste services business, the ability to expand our overall recycling and waste management services and reduce our dependence on our largest customers will require us to attract additional customers and expand the services we offer.\nOur success depends on our ability to successfully expand, operate, and manage our operations. Our ability to expand successfully will depend upon a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022the continued development of our business;\n\u2022the hiring, training, and retention of additional personnel;\n\u2022the ability to enhance our operational, financial, and management systems;\n\u2022the availability of adequate financing;\n\u2022competitive factors;\n\u2022general economic and business conditions;\n\u2022the ability to leverage on the factors expanding the growth of recycling;\n\u2022the ability to expand our customer base, the types of recyclable materials covered by our services, and our network of third-party service providers;\n\u2022the ability to implement new methods for revenue generation; and\n\u2022the ability to expand our relationships with third parties that are also engaged in activities relating to reducing, reusing, and recycling.\nWe may not be able to enhance our existing recycling, reuse, and proper disposal solutions and develop new solutions in a timely manner.\nOur future operating results will depend to a significant extent on our ability to continue to provide efficient and innovative recycling, reuse, and disposal services that compare favorably with alternative services on the basis of cost, performance, and customer preferences. Our success in maintaining and growing with our existing customers and attracting new customers depends on various factors, including the following:\n\u2022innovative development of new services for customers;\n\u2022maintenance of quality standards;\n\u2022efficient and cost-effective services; and\n\u2022utilization of advances in technology.\nOur inability to enhance our existing services and develop new services on a timely basis could harm our operating results and impede our growth.\nWe rely on independent third-party subcontractors to provide recycling services to our customers, and any interruptions of these arrangements could increase our costs, disrupt our services, and result in our inability to service our recycling customers, which would adversely affect our business.\nWe outsource the collection, processing, recycling, and disposal of waste streams and recyclables to independent third-party subcontractors. We rely on our subcontractors to maintain high levels of service. The loss of our relationships with our subcontractors, or their failure to conduct their services for us as anticipated in terms of cost, quality, and timeliness could adversely affect our ability to service our customers in accordance with required service, quality, and performance requirements. If this were to occur, the resulting decline in profitability could harm our business. Securing new high-quality and cost-effective subcontractors frequently is time-consuming and may not be successful, which could result in reduced revenue and various unforeseen operational problems.\nOur subcontractors may maintain their own operations or serve other customers, a number of which may provide them with more business than we do. As a result, our subcontractors could determine to prioritize their capacity for their own operations or for other customers or reduce or eliminate services for us on short notice. If we have any such problems, we may be unable to service our customers in a cost-effective, high-quality, or timely manner, particularly in certain geographical areas, which may adversely affect our business and operating results. Our subcontractors also may seek to compete with us for customers they serve on our behalf or potential customers that we desire to serve.\nWe may face potential environmental liabilities that may not be covered by our insurance, and changes in insurance costs and availability may also impact our financial results.\nWe may incur liabilities for damage to the environment as a result of the operations of our third-party subcontractors. While we do not conduct physical haulage, recycling, or disposal operations, we retain third-party service providers to carry on those activities. These operations may expose us to liability for environmental damages, in some cases even if we did not directly cause the environmental damage. Further, under our agreements with our customers, we are often required to indemnify our customers from any liabilities or claims arising out of our actions or those of our subcontractors and from any release, threatened release, handling, or storage of\nhazardous and other materials from our customers\u2019 premises as a result of or connected with the performance of services by us or our subcontractors to our customers. If we were to incur substantial liability for environmental damage, our or our subcontractors\u2019 insurance coverage may not fully cover or may be inadequate to cover such liability. Also, because of the variable condition of the insurance market, we may experience future increases in self-insurance levels, increased retention levels, and increased premiums. This could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to third parties may adversely affect our revenue, operating income, and cash flows.\nWe process a variety of recyclable materials, such as metal, tires, motor oil and oil filters, food waste, meat rendering, cooking oil, grease, and cardboard, for sale to third parties, and we may directly or indirectly receive proceeds from the sale of such recyclable materials. Our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials. The resale and purchase prices of, and market demand for, recyclable materials can be volatile because of changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control. These fluctuations may affect the cost of and demand for our services and our future revenue, operating income, and cash flows. For example, a decline in oil prices would have an adverse effect on our revenue.\nA significant disruption in our computer systems or a cybersecurity breach could adversely affect our operations.\nWe rely extensively on our computer systems to manage a variety of our business processes. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from various sources, including power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cybersecurity breaches, vandalism, severe weather conditions, catastrophic events, and human error. Our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If our systems are damaged, fail to function properly, or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Any compromise of our data security could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information, and a loss of confidence in our data security measures, which could harm our business.\nWe rely on third-party technology, server, and hardware providers for our operations and for maintaining our data, and a failure of service by these providers could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe rely upon third-party data center providers to host our main servers. In the event that these providers experience any interruption in operations or cease operations for any reason or if we are unable to agree on satisfactory terms for continued hosting relationships, we would be forced to enter into relationships with other service providers or assume hosting responsibilities ourselves. If we are forced to switch hosting facilities, we may not be successful in finding alternative service providers on acceptable terms or in hosting the computer servers ourselves. We may also be limited in our remedies against these providers in the event of a failure of service. We also rely on third-party providers for components of our technology platform, such as hardware and software providers and domain name registrars. A failure or limitation of service or available capacity by any of these third-party providers could adversely affect our business.\nProblems with our computer and communication systems may harm our business.\nAn element of our strategy is to generate and provide content, data, and reporting on our website portals to and from third parties. Accordingly, the satisfactory performance, reliability, and availability of our systems, transaction-processing systems, and communications infrastructure are critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers, as well as to maintain adequate customer service levels. We may experience periodic systems interruptions. Any substantial increase in the volume of traffic on our infrastructure may require us to expand and upgrade our technology, transaction-processing systems, and other features. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to project accurately the rate or timing of increases, if any, in the use of our infrastructure or timely expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such increases.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property claims that create uncertainty about ownership of technology essential to our business and divert our managerial and other resources.\nThere has been a substantial amount of litigation regarding intellectual property rights. We can provide no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to our current or future services, trademarks, or other proprietary rights. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property and to operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others in the process. There can be no assurance that any of our intellectual property will be adequately safeguarded or that it will not be challenged by third parties. We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims that would be costly to defend, could limit our ability to use certain critical technologies, and may divert our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. We may not prevail in any of these suits. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could cause us to pay substantial damages, including treble damages, if we willfully infringe and also could increase the risk of our patent applications not being issued.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, during the\ncourse of this kind of litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation. If these results are perceived to be negative, it could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe waste and recycling industries are subject to extensive government regulation, and existing or future regulations may adversely affect our current or future operations, increase our costs of operations, or require us to make additional capital expenditures.\nStringent government regulations at the federal, state, and local level may have substantial impact on our business, our third-party service providers, and our customers. A large number of complex laws, rules, orders, and interpretations govern environmental protection, health, safety, land use, zoning, transportation, and related matters. Among other things, these regulations may restrict the business of our third-party service providers\u2019 and our customers\u2019 operations and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows by imposing conditions, such as the following:\n\u2022limitations on siting and constructing new recycling, waste disposal, transfer, or processing facilities or expanding existing facilities;\n\u2022limitations, regulations, or levies on collection and disposal prices, rates, and volumes;\n\u2022limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of out-of-state materials or certain categories of materials; or\n\u2022mandates regarding the disposal of solid waste, including requirements to recycle rather than landfill certain disposables.\nRegulations affecting the siting, design, and closure of landfills could require our third-party service providers or customers to undertake investigatory or remedial activities, curtail operations, or close landfills temporarily or permanently. Future changes in these regulations may require our third-party service providers or our customers to modify, supplement, or replace equipment or facilities. The costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial, which may reduce the ability or willingness of our customers to use our services and adversely affect our results of operations.\nEnvironmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change. The adoption of laws and regulations to implement controls of greenhouse gases, including the imposition of fees or taxes, could adversely affect the operations of enterprises with which we do business. Additionally, certain states may adopt air pollution control regulations that are more stringent than existing and proposed federal regulations. Changing environmental regulations could require us or enterprises with which we do business to take any number of actions, including the purchase of emission allowances or installation of additional pollution control technology, and could make some operations less profitable, which could reduce the ability or willingness of our customers to use our services and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the potential impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain. Although the financial impact of these potential changes is not reasonably estimable at this time, our operations in certain locations and those of our customers and suppliers could potentially be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our sales, profitability and cash flows.\nPrice increases may not be adequate to offset the impact of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume.\nFrom time to time, our competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand their market share. General economic and market-specific conditions, as well as the concentration of our business with major companies, may also limit our ability to raise prices. As a result of these factors, we may be unable to offset increases in costs, improve our operating margins, and obtain returns through price increases.\nWe face intense competition from larger, more established companies, and we may not be able to compete effectively, which could reduce demand for our recycling services.\nThe waste materials industry as a whole is dominated by large national players, such as Waste Management and Republic Services. To date, these large companies have concentrated on their traditional business of collecting waste for disposal in their landfills rather than recycling. The strategies of these large companies could change at any time, and we could begin to experience substantially increased competition from them. These companies have substantially greater market recognition, substantially larger customer bases, and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we possess and that afford them competitive advantages over us. As a result, they are able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of services similar to those that we provide, to provide comparable services at lower prices, and to introduce new solutions and respond to customer requirements more quickly than we can.\nOur ability to compete successfully in the recycling services market depends on a number of factors, both within and outside our control. These factors include the following:\n\u2022our success in designing and introducing new solutions;\n\u2022our ability to predict the evolving needs of our customers and to convince them to use our services;\n\u2022our ability to meet our customer\u2019s requirements in terms of cost, reliability, speed, and capacity;\n\u2022the quality of our customer services; and\n\u2022service introductions by our competitors or potential competitors.\nOur customers impose substantial requirements relating to the recycling and waste management services we provide them.\nOur customers impose substantial requirements relating to the recycling services we provide them. Our arrangements with our customers generally contain provisions including (a) relatively short contract terms with extensions at the discretion of the customer, (b) requirements that we assume full responsibility for all operational aspects of the services, (c) requirements that we comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and other governmental requirements, (d) requirements that we hold subcontractors to the same standards to which we are subject, (e) prohibitions on price increases without customer consent, (f) designation of service locations, service frequency, and equipment, (g) specifications on procedures for rendering services, (h) notification to customer of any spills, releases, or discharges of materials, (i) requirements that we supply a self-performance audit, (j) requirements that we render monthly or quarterly reports to the customer, (k) requirements that we render monthly invoicing in approved time frames and formats, and (l) requirements that we maintain specified records. If we are unable to meet the requirements in a significant number of these contracts, such contracts could be cancelled, and the cancellation of such contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and operations.\nOur current indebtedness requires us to comply with certain restrictive loan covenants which may limit our ability to operate our business.\nUnder the terms of our PNC Loan Agreement and our Credit Agreement (each as defined in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements), we are subject to certain financial covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a senior net leverage ratio. In addition, the PNC Loan Agreement and the Credit Agreement each contains negative covenants limiting, among other things, additional indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, additional liens, sales of assets, dividends, investments and advances, prepayments of debt, mergers and acquisitions, and other matter customarily restricted in such agreements. The PNC Loan Agreement and the Credit Agreement each also contains customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, events of bankruptcy and insolvency, change of control, and failure of any guaranty or security document supporting the PNC Loan Agreement or the Credit Agreement, as applicable, to be in full force and effect. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the PNC Loan Agreement and/or the Credit Agreement, as applicable, may be accelerated and become immediately due and payable. We can provide no assurance that, if we are unable to comply with these covenants in the future, we will be able to obtain the necessary waivers or amend our PNC Loan Agreement and/or our Credit Agreement to prevent a default.\nA breach of any of these covenants or requirements could result in a default under our PNC Loan Agreement and/or our Credit Agreement. If we default under our PNC Loan Agreement and/or our Credit Agreement and we are unable to cure the default or obtain a waiver, we will not be able to access the credit available under our PNC Loan Agreement and/or our Credit Agreement, as applicable, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain alternative financing. In addition, our level of indebtedness may limit our financial flexibility and could affect our operations. Even if new financing is available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us. No assurance can be given that our future operating results will be sufficient to achieve compliance with the covenants and requirements of our PNC Loan Agreement and our Credit Agreement.\nWe may need additional capital in the future.\nThe development and expansion of our business may require additional funds. In the future, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to provide funds for our business and operations. Such financing may not be available or may not be available on satisfactory terms. In addition, the terms of our PNC Loan Agreement and the Credit Agreement could limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to expand our operations. While debt financing will enable us to expand our business more rapidly than we otherwise would be able to do, debt financing increases expenses and we must repay the debt regardless of our operating results. Equity financings could result in dilution to our existing stockholders.\nOur inability to obtain adequate capital resources, whether in the form of equity or debt, to fund our business and growth strategies, may require us to delay, scale back, or eliminate some or all of our operations, which may adversely affect our financial results and operations.\nWe depend on key personnel who would be difficult to replace, and our business will likely be harmed if we lose their services or cannot hire additional qualified personnel.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon the continued services of our current management team and key personnel. The loss of one or more of our key executives or employees could have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance policies on the lives of any of our executives or any of our other employees. We employ all of our executives and key employees on an at-will basis, and their employment can be terminated by us or them at any time, for any reason, and without notice, subject, in certain cases, to severance payment rights. In order to retain valuable employees, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we regard our ability as a public company to grant stock-based compensation as an important component of our ability to\nattract and retain key personnel. The value to employees of stock-based compensation over time will be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract offers from other companies.\nOur success also depends on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate additional skilled management personnel. We plan to continue to expand our work force to continue to enhance our business and operating results. We believe that there is significant competition for qualified personnel with the skills and knowledge that we require. Many of the other companies with which we compete for qualified personnel have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high-quality candidates than those which we have to offer. If we are not able to retain our current key personnel or attract the necessary qualified key personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our business objectives and our ability to pursue our business strategy. New hires require significant training and, in most cases, take significant time before they achieve full productivity. New employees may not become as productive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. If our recruiting, training, and retention efforts are not successful or do not generate a corresponding increase in revenue, our business will be harmed.\nOur operating results may experience significant fluctuations, which may make them difficult to predict.\nIn addition to the variability resulting from the short-term nature of our customers\u2019 commitments, other factors contribute to periodic and seasonal quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations, which could be significant. These factors include the following:\n\u2022the cyclicality of the markets we serve;\n\u2022the timing and size of orders;\n\u2022the volume of business opportunities relative to our capacity;\n\u2022service introductions and market acceptance of new service offerings;\n\u2022timing of expenses in anticipation of future business;\n\u2022changes in the mix of the services we render;\n\u2022changes in cost and availability of labor and third-party vendors;\n\u2022changes in the value of commodities;\n\u2022changes in prices or market requirements for recyclable materials;\n\u2022timely delivery of services to customers;\n\u2022pricing and availability of competitive services;\n\u2022pressures on reducing selling prices;\n\u2022the success in serving new markets;\n\u2022introduction of new technologies into the markets we serve; and\n\u2022changes in economic conditions.\nPotential strategic alliances may not achieve their objectives, and the failure to do so could impede our growth.\nWe anticipate that we will enter into strategic alliances. Among other matters, we explore strategic alliances designed to enhance our service offerings, enlarge our customer base, provide valuable knowhow, or take advantage of new methods or technologies. Any strategic alliances may not achieve their intended objectives, and parties to our strategic alliances may not perform as contemplated. The failure of these alliances may impede our ability to expand our existing markets or to enter new markets.\nAny acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and harm our operating results.\nWe plan to review strategic opportunities to buy other businesses that would complement our current service offerings, expand the scope of our service offerings, expand the breadth of our markets and sales channels, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. If we make any future acquisitions, we could issue securities that would dilute the percentage ownership of our stockholders, incur substantial debt, or assume contingent liabilities.\nOur experience in acquiring other businesses is limited. Potential acquisitions also involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022problems integrating the acquired operations, services, personnel, or technologies with our own;\n\u2022unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core businesses;\n\u2022adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;\n\u2022potential loss of key employees and customers of purchased organizations;\n\u2022risk of impairment charges related to potential write-downs of acquired assets in acquisitions; and\n\u2022the impact on our internal controls of compliance with the regulatory requirements under Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nOur acquisition strategy entails reviewing and potentially reorganizing acquired business operations, corporate infrastructure, and systems, and financial controls. Unforeseen expenses, difficulties, and delays frequently encountered in connection with rapid expansion through acquisitions could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our profitability. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to complete the acquisitions of candidates that we identify. Increased competition for acquisition candidates may increase purchase prices for acquisitions to levels beyond our financial capability or to levels that would not result in the returns required by our acquisition criteria. In addition, we may encounter difficulties in integrating the operations of acquired businesses with our own operations or managing acquired businesses profitably without substantial costs, delays, or other operational or financial problems.\nOur strategy to increase our growth through acquisitions may be unsuccessful and could adversely affect our business and results.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to further acquire other businesses; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, successfully acquire identified targets or successfully integrate the business of acquired companies to realize the full benefits of the combined businesses.\nWhile we recently acquired Green Remedies and RWS in connection with our growth strategy to acquire other businesses, we can provide no assurance that we will identify appropriate acquisition targets, successfully complete any future acquisitions or successfully integrate the business of companies we do acquire. Even if we successfully acquire a business entity, there is no assurance that our combined business will become profitable. The process of completing the integration of acquired businesses could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our company and the loss of key personnel. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the pursuit of business acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses, and the incurrence of significant, acquisition related costs in connection with proposed and completed acquisitions, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf the benefits of any completed or proposed acquisition of do not meet the expectations of investors, stockholders or financial analysts, the market price of our Common Stock may decline.\nIf the benefits of any completed acquisition (including Green Remedies and RWS) or proposed acquisition do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of our Common Stock prior to such acquisition may decline. The market values of our Common Stock at the time of an acquisition may vary significantly from their prices on the date the acquisition target was identified.\nThe effects of global economic conditions may impact our business, operating results, or financial condition.\nGlobal economic conditions and political events, domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities or complications due to natural, nuclear or other disasters and pandemics or other health crises (including the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic, which may reduce demand for our services because of reduced global or national economic activity), can cause disruptions and extreme volatility in global financial markets, increase rates of default and bankruptcy, and impact levels of consumer and commercial spending.\nThe emergence of COVID-19 around the world presents significant risks to our company, not all of which we are able to fully evaluate or even to foresee at the current time. In the short-term, some of our customers have shut down their businesses, while other customers operating in the restaurant, grocery, automotive and certain specialty retail industries, which may be considered as essential businesses in different jurisdictions, or customers that are more capable of working remotely than other industries, have been allowed to operate.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may affect our operations in the future. All of these factors may have far reaching impacts on our business, operations, and financial results and conditions, directly and indirectly, including without limitation impacts on the health of our company\u2019s management and employees, marketing and sales operations, customer and consumer behaviors, and on the overall economy. The scope and nature of these impacts, most of which are beyond our company\u2019s control, continue to evolve and the outcomes are uncertain. Management cannot predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our company\u2019s sales or on economic conditions generally. The ultimate extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our company is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments, and such effects could exist for an extended period of time even after the pandemic.\nThe members of our board of directors and our executive officers have broad rights.\nOur business is operated under the control of our board of directors and officers. Stockholders have no right to take part in the control of our affairs or the day-to-day management or operation of the business. Stockholders are permitted to vote only in a limited number of circumstances. While the members of the board of directors are accountable as fiduciaries and are obligated to exercise duties of due care, loyalty, and full disclosure in handling our affairs, the board of directors is entitled to certain limitations of liability and to indemnity by us. Such indemnity and limitation of liability may limit rights that our stockholders would otherwise have to seek redress against the board of directors. Our executive officers are entitled to similar indemnification and limitation of liability. Our stockholders who have questions concerning the duties of the board of directors to our stockholders should consult their own legal counsel.\nCertain conflicts of interest exist within our organization.\nCertain members of our board of directors, as holders of our capital stock, may have conflicts of interest with respect to our company and the stockholders and with respect to the exercise of their voting rights for the shares that they own.\nThe compensation we pay to our executive officers and employees will likely increase.\nWe believe that the compensation we have historically paid to our executive officers and certain of our employees is within the lower quartile of compensation paid by companies similar to us. We may increase the compensation payable to our executive officers and employees, which could include both base compensation and cash or equity bonuses and payouts under severance or change in control arrangements. An increase in compensation and bonuses payable to our executive officers and employees could decrease our net income or increase our net loss.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nOur reporting obligations as a public company place a significant strain on our management and our operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to produce reliable financial reports or help prevent fraud. Our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could prevent us from filing our periodic reports on a timely basis, which could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements, harm our business, and negatively impact the trading price of our Common Stock.\nThe interest rates for our obligations under our ABL Facility with PNC might be subject to change based on recent regulatory changes.\nIn July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration, together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administrator, (the \u201cIBA\u201d) for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank offered rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, the London interbank offered rate, or \u201cLIBOR,\u201d may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon which to determine the interest rate on our loans under the ABL Facility (as defined herein) with PNC, and it is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index, calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere. The ABL Facility provides procedures for determining a replacement or alternative rate in the event that LIBOR is unavailable. However, there can be no assurance as to whether such replacement or alternative rate will be more or less favorable than LIBOR. To the extent these interest rates increase, our interest expense will increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIncreased prices and inflation could negatively impact our financial results.\nThough we believe that the rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on our operations, a continued increase in inflation, including inflationary pressure on labor and the goods and services we rely upon to deliver service to our customers, could result in increases to our operating costs, and we may be unable to pass these costs on to our customers. If inflation in these costs increases beyond our ability to control for them through measures such as implementing operating efficiencies, we may not be able to increase prices to sufficiently offset the effect of various cost increases without negatively impacting customer demand, thereby increasing our costs of doing business and reducing our margins. If such impacts are prolonged and substantial, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are currently operating in a period of economic uncertainty and capital markets disruption, which has been significantly impacted by geopolitical instability due to the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by any negative impact on the global economy and capital markets resulting from the conflict in Ukraine or any other geopolitical tensions.\nU.S. and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions and the start of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. On February 24, 2022, a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops was reported. Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable, the conflict in Ukraine could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions. We are continuing to monitor the situation in Ukraine and globally and assessing its potential impact on our business.\nAdditionally, Russia\u2019s prior annexation of Crimea, recent recognition of two separatist republics in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine and subsequent military interventions in Ukraine have led to sanctions and other penalties being levied by the United States, European Union and other countries against Russia, Belarus, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, and the so-called Luhansk People\u2019s Republic, including agreements to remove certain Russian financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication payment system. Additional potential sanctions and penalties have also been proposed and/or threatened. Russian military actions and the resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets, potentially making it more difficult for us to obtain additional funds.\nAny of the abovementioned factors could affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be substantial. Any such disruptions may also magnify the impact of other risks described in this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile, and the value of an investment in our Common Stock may decline.\nThe trading price of our Common Stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. In addition to the risk factors described in this section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, factors that may cause the price of our Common Stock to fluctuate include the following:\n\u2022limited trading activity in our Common Stock;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual financial results;\n\u2022the financial guidance we may provide to the public, any changes in such guidance, or our failure to meet such guidance;\n\u2022the failure of industry or securities analysts to maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates by any industry or securities analysts that follow our company, or our failure to meet such estimates;\n\u2022various market factors or perceived market factors, including rumors, whether or not correct, involving us, our customers, our strategic partners, or our competitors;\n\u2022sales, or anticipated sales, of large blocks of our stock;\n\u2022short selling of our Common Stock by investors;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022announcements of technological innovations by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022introductions of new services or new pricing policies by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022changing competitive factors;\n\u2022regulatory or political developments;\n\u2022fluctuating commodity prices, including oil;\n\u2022litigation and governmental or regulatory investigations;\n\u2022acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or by our competitors; and\n\u2022general economic, political, and financial market conditions or events.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our Common Stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise\nnegatively affect the price or liquidity of our Common Stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders were to bring a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit or paying for settlements or damages. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business.\nFuture sales of our Common Stock in the public market by our existing stockholders, or the perception that such sales might occur, could depress the market price of our Common Stock.\nThe market price of our Common Stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Common Stock in the market, and even the perception that these sales could occur may depress the market price. As of December 31, 2021, we had 19,045,988 shares of our Common Stock outstanding. Many of these shares may be sold in the public market, subject to prior registration or qualification for an exemption from registration, including, in the case of shares held by affiliates, compliance with the volume restrictions of Rule 144. Shares held by affiliates of our company, which generally include our directors, officers, and certain principal stockholders, are subject to the resale limitations of Rule 144 as described below. We also may register for resale shares that are deemed to be \u201crestricted securities\u201d or shares held by affiliates of our company.\nIn general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, any person or persons whose shares are aggregated for purposes of Rule 144, who is deemed an affiliate of our company and beneficially owns restricted securities with respect to which at least six months has elapsed since the later of the date the shares were acquired from us, or from an affiliate of ours, is entitled to sell within any three-month period a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of 1% of the then outstanding shares of our Common Stock and the average weekly trading volume in Common Stock during the four calendar weeks preceding such sale. Sales by affiliates under Rule 144 also are subject to certain manner-of-sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us. Rule 701, as currently in effect, permits our employees, officers, directors, and consultants who purchase shares pursuant to a written compensatory plan or contract to resell these shares in reliance upon Rule 144, but without compliance with specific restrictions.\nRule 701 provides that affiliates may sell their Rule 701 shares under Rule 144 without complying with the holding period requirement and that non-affiliates may sell their shares in reliance on Rule 144 without complying with the holding period, public information, volume limitation, or notice provisions of Rule 144. A person who is not an affiliate, who has not been an affiliate within three months prior to sale, and who beneficially owns restricted securities with respect to which at least one year has elapsed since the later of the date the shares were acquired from us, or from an affiliate of ours, is entitled to sell such shares under Rule 144 without regard to any of the volume limitations or other requirements described above. Sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price for our Common Stock.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 4,328,730 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, DSUs, and warrants under our incentive compensation plan and other option and warrant agreements. Upon the exercise of stock options and warrants, such shares generally will be eligible for sale in the public market, except that affiliates will continue to be subject to volume limitations and other requirements of Rule 144. The issuance or sale of such shares could depress the market price of our Common Stock.\nFuture sales and issuances of our Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock by us, including pursuant to our equity incentive plan and employee stock purchase plan, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe intend to issue additional securities pursuant to our equity incentive plan and our employee stock purchase plan may issue equity or convertible securities in the future. To the extent we do so, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell Common Stock, convertible securities, or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell Common Stock, convertible securities, or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nOur directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders have substantial control over us and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nOur directors, executive officers, and holders of more than 5% of our Common Stock, together with their affiliates, beneficially own or control a majority of our outstanding Common Stock. If these stockholders act together, including with respect to the election of specified directors as contemplated by a voting agreement among certain of them, they will be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets. This concentration of ownership could limit your ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us.\nAnti-takeover provisions could impair a takeover attempt of our company even if the transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders and could make it difficult for you to change our management.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and applicable provisions of Nevada law may have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition of our company, even when this would be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that provide for the following:\n\u2022authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\u2022specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors or the chairman of our board of directors;\n\u2022establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022establish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II, and Class III, with each class serving three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors; and\n\u2022provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 78.438 of the Nevada General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Nevada corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of two years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our board of directors. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, other provisions of Nevada law may also discourage, delay, or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. Any provision of our articles of incorporation or bylaws or Nevada law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Common Stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Common Stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, or our market, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock will be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. If adequate research coverage is not established or maintained on our company or if any of the analysts who may cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or provide relatively more favorable recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nSince we do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future, our stockholders may be forced to sell their stock in order to obtain a return on their investment.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of our PNC Loan Agreement and the Credit Agreement restrict our ability to declare cash dividends. We plan to retain any future earnings to finance our operations and growth plans. Our credit agreement also prohibits us from paying dividends on our Common Stock. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of shares of their Common Stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any return on their investment.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities.\nStockholders may, from time to time, engage in proxy solicitations or advance stockholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to effect changes and assert influence on our board of directors and management. Activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction or seek changes in the composition of our board of directors could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A proxy contest would require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses and administrative and associated costs and require significant time and attention by our board of directors and management, diverting their attention from the pursuit of our business strategy. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy, or changes to the composition of our board of directors or senior management team arising from a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability which may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives, or limit our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If individuals are ultimately elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our stockholders. We may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of the proxy contest or matters arising from the proxy contest, which would serve as a further distraction to our board of directors and\nmanagement and would require us to incur significant additional costs. In addition, actions such as those described above could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based upon temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.", "PERMNO": 14663, "SIC": 4950, "TIC": "QRHC"}
