RISK FACTORS\nBefore you invest in our securities you should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information provided in this report. We believe that the following information identifies the most significant risks that may impact us. However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into an actual event, the event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case the market price of our common stock could decline.\nThe hospitality industry is highly competitive and we are subject to risks relating to competition that may adversely affect our performance.\nWe will be adversely impacted if we cannot compete effectively in the highly competitive hospitality industry. Our continued success depends upon our ability to compete effectively in markets that contain numerous competitors, some of which may have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Competition may reduce fee structures, potentially causing us to lower our fees or prices, which may adversely impact our profits. New competition or existing competition that uses a business model that is different from our business model may require us to change our model so that we can remain competitive.\nWe may not be able to achieve our growth and performance objectives.\nWe may not be able to achieve our growth and performance objectives for increasing: our earnings and cash flows, the number of franchised and/or managed properties in our hotel group business, the number of vacation exchange members and related transactions, the number of rental weeks sold by and the number of units in our destination network business, and the number of tours and new owners generated and vacation ownership interests sold by our vacation ownership business.\nAcquisitions and other strategic transactions may not prove successful and could result in operating difficulties and failure to realize anticipated benefits.\nWe regularly consider a wide array of acquisitions and other potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of businesses and real property, joint ventures, business combinations, strategic investments and dispositions. Any of these transactions could be material to our business. We often compete for these opportunities with third parties, which may cause us to lose potential opportunities or to pay more than we might otherwise have paid absent such competition. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and consummate strategic transactions and opportunities on favorable terms or that any such strategic transactions or opportunities, if consummated, will be successful. Acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve significant risk and the process of integrating and assimilating any strategic transaction may create unforeseen operating difficulties and costs and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any of these strategic transactions or opportunities. Pursuing and consummating strategic transactions and opportunities may require us to issue significant additional debt or obtain equity financing, spend existing cash or incur liabilities and other expenses including amortization of acquired intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill. Strategic transactions may be entered into by us or by one or more of our subsidiaries. With respect to those transactions entered into by a subsidiary, we may from time to time provide a performance guaranty of the subsidiary\u2019s obligations, which may expose us to litigation risks in the event of a dispute between transaction parties.\nWe are dependent on our senior management.\nWe believe that our future growth depends in part on the continued services of our senior management team. Losing the services of any members of our senior management team could adversely affect our strategic and customer relationships and impede our ability to execute our business strategies.\nOur revenues are highly dependent on the travel industry and declines in or disruptions to the travel industry such as those caused by economic slowdown, terrorism, political strife, pandemics or threats of pandemics, acts of God and war may adversely affect us.\nDeclines in or disruptions to the travel industry may adversely impact us. Risks affecting the travel industry include: economic slowdown and recession; economic factors such as increased costs of living and reduced discretionary income adversely impacting consumers\u2019 and businesses\u2019 decisions to use and consume travel services and products; terrorist incidents and threats and associated heightened travel security measures; political and regional strife; acts of God such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, volcanoes and other natural disasters; war; concerns with or threats of pandemics, contagious diseases or health epidemics; environmental\ndisasters; increased pricing, financial instability and capacity constraints of air carriers; airline job actions and strikes; and increases in gasoline and other fuel prices.\nWe are subject to operating or other risks common to the hospitality industry.\nOur business is subject to numerous operating or other risks common to the hospitality industry including:\n\u2022\nchanges in operating costs including inflation, energy, labor costs such as minimum wage increases and unionization, workers\u2019 compensation and health-care related costs and insurance\n\u2022\nincreases in travel costs including air travel could negatively impact consumer preferences for our vacation and resort destinations and vacation ownership preferences and, if such conditions were to be sustained, the desirability of our vacation, resort and hotel products and offerings could be adversely impacted\n\u2022\nchanges in desirability of geographic regions of the hotels or resorts in our business\n\u2022\nchanges in the supply and demand for hotel rooms, destination network services and products and vacation ownership services and products\n\u2022\nevolving changes in consumer travel and vacation patterns and consumer preferences\n\u2022\nseasonality in our businesses, which may cause fluctuations in our operating results\n\u2022\ngeographic concentrations of our operations and customers\n\u2022\nincreases in costs due to inflation that may not be fully offset by price and fee increases in our business\n\u2022\navailability of acceptable financing and cost of capital as they apply to us, our customers, current and potential hotel franchisees and developers, owners of hotels with which we have hotel management contracts, owners of vacation rental properties, our RCI affiliates and other developers of vacation ownership resorts and timeshare homeowner associations\n\u2022\nthe quality of the services provided by franchisees, affiliated resorts and properties in our destination network business or resorts in which we sell vacation ownership interests may adversely affect our image, reputation and brand value\n\u2022\nour ability to generate sufficient cash to buy from third-party suppliers the products that we need to provide to the participants in our points programs who want to redeem points for such products\n\u2022\noverbuilding or excess capacity in one or more segments of the hospitality industry or in one or more geographic regions\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and maintain positive relations and contractual arrangements with current and potential franchisees, hotel owners, vacation exchange members, vacation ownership interest owners, resorts with units that are exchanged through our destination network business and/or owners of vacation properties that our destination network business markets for rental and timeshare homeowner associations\n\u2022\nour ability to adjust our business model to generate greater cash flow and require less capital expenditures\n\u2022\norganized labor activities and associated litigation\n\u2022\nthe bankruptcy or insolvency of any one of our customers, which could impair our ability to collect outstanding fees or other amounts due or otherwise exercise our contractual rights\n\u2022\nour failure to keep pace with technological developments could impair our competitive position\n\u2022\ndisruptions, including non-renewal or termination of agreements, in relationships with third parties including marketing alliances and affiliations with e-commerce channels\n\u2022\nchanges in the number, occupancy and room rates of hotels operating under franchise and management agreements\n\u2022\nrevenues from our hotel group business are indirectly affected by our franchisees\u2019 pricing decisions\n\u2022\nfranchisees or other developers that have development advance notes with us may experience financial difficulties\n\u2022\nconsolidation of developers could adversely affect our destination network business\n\u2022\ndecrease in the supply of available destination network accommodations due to, among other reasons, a decrease in inventory included in the system or resulting from ongoing property renovations or a decrease in member deposits could adversely affect our destination network business\n\u2022\nthe viability of homeowners associations which we manage and the maintenance and refurbishment of vacation ownership properties depends on the ability to collect sufficient maintenance fees\n\u2022\nour ability to securitize the receivables that we originate in connection with sales of vacation ownership interests\n\u2022\nunlawful or deceptive third-party vacation ownership interest resale schemes could damage our reputation and brand value\n\u2022\nthe availability of and competition for desirable sites for the development of vacation ownership properties; difficulties associated with obtaining required approvals to develop vacation ownership properties; liability under state and local laws with respect to any construction defects in the vacation ownership properties we develop; and risks related to real estate project development costs and completion\n\u2022\nprivate resale of vacation ownership interests could adversely affect our vacation ownership resorts and destination network business\n\u2022\ndisputes with franchisees, vacation exchange affiliation partners, owners of vacation rental properties, owners of vacation ownership interests and homeowner associations may result in litigation and the loss of management contracts\n\u2022\nnegative publicity from online social media postings and related media reports could damage our brands\nThird-party Internet reservation systems and peer-to-peer online networks may adversely impact us.\nConsumers increasingly use third-party Internet travel intermediaries and peer-to-peer online networks to search for and book their hotel, resort and other travel accommodations. As the use of these third-party reservation channels increases, consumers may rely on these channels to the detriment of our hotel, rental and vacation ownership brands bookings and rates. In addition, the continued development and use of peer-to-peer online networks for lodging and vacation rentals are causing some local governments to enact bans or restrictions on short-term property rentals that may adversely impact our vacation rental business.\nThe continued success of our hotel business relies upon continued growth in the number of hotel properties under our brands and the performance of our franchisees.\nWe have been historically successful in growing the number of our brands and franchised hotels in our hotel business and our revenues and profitability in our hotel segment relies upon our achieving continued growth objectives for franchised hotels. We are subject to many challenges sustaining system size and growing the number of our franchised hotels including maintaining the quality of our service or services through third-party providers, operational support and reservation systems to support our franchisees, our ability to compete with other hotel owners for existing and future hotel franchisees, our ability to continue and enhance consumer acceptance of our brands and the quality of our managers and entire organization in supporting our hotel business. We also are subject to the risk of entering into franchise relationships with owners and operators who do not achieve or maintain the quality standards we set, which if not appropriately and timely addressed could adversely impact our brand image and our ability to attract quality franchisee operators.\nOur hotel business depends in part on our management arrangements with third parties.\nOur hotel business is a party to management arrangements with certain of our hotel owners under which we may be required in certain instances to satisfy certain financial and performance criteria and standards. Our ability to satisfy these financial and other performance criteria is subject to many of the risks common to the hotel industry as described in this report. Should any of these arrangements be terminated by reason of our failure to satisfy financial or performance criteria or require us to make payments that result in us incurring losses, it may have an adverse impact on our operating performance and profitability. We may provide a parent guaranty of our subsidiaries\u2019 performance under the arrangements which could expose us to litigation risks in the event of a dispute. We cannot assure you that all of our current and future management arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into new management arrangements in the future on favorable terms.\nWe are subject to risks related to our vacation ownership receivables portfolio.\nWe are subject to risks that purchasers of vacation ownership interests who finance a portion of the purchase price default on their loans due to adverse macro or personal economic conditions, third-party organizations that encourage defaults or otherwise, which would increase loan loss reserves and adversely affect loan portfolio performance; if such defaults occur during the early part of the loan amortization period we will not have recovered the marketing, selling, administrative and other costs associated with such vacation ownership interests; such costs will be incurred again in connection with the resale of the repossessed vacation ownership interest; and the value we recover in a default is not in all instances sufficient to cover the outstanding debt.\nOur international operations are subject to risks not generally applicable to our domestic operations.\nOur international operations are subject to numerous risks including exposure to local economic conditions; potential adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the U.S.; hostility from local populations; political instability; threats or acts of terrorism; restrictions and taxes on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings; government policies against businesses or properties owned by foreigners; investment restrictions or requirements; diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights in foreign countries; foreign exchange restrictions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; conflicts between local laws and U.S. laws including laws that impact our rights to protect our intellectual property; withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries; and changes in and application of foreign taxation structures including value added taxes. Any adverse outcome resulting from the financial instability or performance of foreign economies, the instability of other currencies and the related volatility on foreign exchange and interest rates could impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nIn addition, we are directly and indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulations worldwide. Changes in such legislation, regulation or interpretation could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. This includes potential changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws arising out of the Base Erosion Profit Shifting project initiated by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.\nWe are subject to certain risks related to our indebtedness, hedging transactions, securitization of certain of our assets, surety bond requirements, the cost and availability of capital and the extension of credit by us.\nWe are a borrower of funds under our credit facilities, credit lines, senior notes, term loan, commercial paper programs and securitization financings. We extend credit when we finance purchases of vacation ownership interests and in instances when we provide key money, development advance notes and mezzanine or other forms of subordinated financing to assist franchisees and hotel owners in converting to or building a new hotel under one of our hotel brands. We also extend credit at times to developers of timeshare or vacation rental properties. We use financial instruments to reduce or hedge our financial exposure to the effects of currency and interest rate fluctuations. We are required to post surety bonds in connection with our development and sales activities. In connection with our debt obligations, hedging transactions, securitization of certain of our assets, surety bond requirements, the cost and availability of capital and the extension of credit by us, we are subject to numerous risks including:\n\u2022\nour cash flows from operations or available lines of credit may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, which could result in a default and acceleration of the underlying debt and under other debt instruments that contain cross-default provisions\n\u2022\nif we are unable to comply with the terms of the financial covenants under our revolving credit facility or other debt, including a breach of the financial ratio tests, such non-compliance could result in a default and acceleration of the underlying revolver debt and under other debt instruments that contain cross-default provisions\n\u2022\nour leverage may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing\n\u2022\nour leverage may require the dedication of a significant portion of our cash flows to the payment of principal and interest thus reducing the availability of cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases or other operating needs\n\u2022\nincreases in interest rates impacting our financing costs and vacation ownership interest financing and associated increases in hedging costs\n\u2022\nrating agency downgrades for our debt that could increase our borrowing costs and prevent us from obtaining additional financing\n\u2022\nfailure or non-performance of counterparties to foreign exchange and interest rate hedging transactions\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to securitize our vacation ownership contract receivables on terms acceptable to us because of, among other factors, the performance of the vacation ownership contract receivables, adverse conditions in the market for vacation ownership loan-backed notes and asset-backed notes in general and the risk that the actual amount of uncollectible accounts on our securitized vacation ownership contract receivables and other credit we extend is greater than expected\n\u2022\nour securitizations contain portfolio performance triggers which if violated may result in a disruption or loss of cash flow from such transactions\n\u2022\na reduction in commitments from surety bond providers which may impair our vacation ownership business by requiring us to escrow cash in order to meet regulatory requirements of certain states\n\u2022\nprohibitive cost and inadequate availability of capital could restrict the development or acquisition of vacation ownership resorts by us and the financing of purchases of vacation ownership interests\n\u2022\nthe inability of hotel owners that have received mezzanine and other loans from us to pay back such loans\n\u2022\nif interest rates increase significantly, we may not be able to increase the interest rate offered to finance purchases of vacation ownership interests by the same amount of the increase\nEconomic conditions affecting the hospitality industry, the global economy and credit markets generally may adversely affect our business and results of operations, our ability to obtain financing or securitize our receivables on reasonable and acceptable terms, the performance of our loan portfolio and the market price of our common stock.\nThe future economic environment for the hospitality industry and the global economy may continue to be challenging. The hospitality industry has experienced and may experience in the future significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of declines in general economic conditions which may lower demand for hospitality services and products. Declines in consumer and commercial spending may adversely affect our revenues and profits.\nOur access to credit and capital also depends in large measure on market liquidity factors, which we do not control. Our ability to access the credit and capital markets may be restricted at times when we require or want access, which could impact our business plans and operating model. Uncertainty or volatility in the equity and credit markets may also negatively affect our ability to access short-term and long-term financing on reasonable terms or at all, which would negatively impact our liquidity and financial condition. In addition, if one or more of the financial institutions that support our existing credit facilities fails we may not be able to find a replacement, which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under the credit facilities. Disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect our credit rating and the market value of our common stock. While we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future, if we are unable to refinance or repay our outstanding debt when due, our results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nOur liquidity as it relates to our vacation ownership contract receivables securitization program could be adversely affected if we were to fail to renew or replace our securitization warehouse conduit facility on its renewal date or if a particular receivables pool were to fail to meet certain ratios, which could occur in certain instances if the default rates or other credit metrics of the underlying vacation ownership contract receivables deteriorate. Our ability to sell securities backed by our vacation ownership contract receivables depends on the continued ability and willingness of capital market participants to invest in such securities.\nIt is possible that asset-backed securities issued under our securitization programs could in the future be downgraded by credit agencies. If a downgrade occurs, our ability to complete other securitization transactions on acceptable terms or at all could be jeopardized. We could be forced to rely on other potentially more expensive and less attractive funding sources to the extent available which would decrease our profitability and may require us to adjust our business operations accordingly including reducing or suspending our financing to purchasers of vacation ownership interests.\nIf for any reason our sources of liquidity, including our securitization programs, were to decrease such that we were required to reduce or suspend our financing for any significant number of purchases of our vacation ownership contracts, our sales of vacation ownership interests would likely decrease.\nWe are subject to risks related to litigation.\nWe are subject to a number of legal actions and the risk of future litigation as described in this report. We cannot predict with certainty the ultimate outcome and related damages and costs of litigation and other proceedings filed by or against us. Adverse results in litigation and other proceedings may harm our business.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect us.\nOur businesses are heavily regulated by federal, state and local governments in the countries in which our operations are conducted. In addition, domestic and foreign federal, state and local regulators may enact new laws and regulations that may reduce our revenues, cause our expenses to increase or require us to modify substantially our business practices. If we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations including among others those governing franchising, timeshare, vacation rentals, consumer financing and other lending, information security, data protection, marketing and sales, unfair and deceptive trade practices, bribery and corruption, telemarketing including do not call and call recording regulations, licensing, labor, employment, anti-discrimination, health care, health and safety, accessibility, immigration, gaming, environmental including climate change, securities, stock exchange listing, accounting, tax and regulations applicable under the Dodd-Frank Act, Office of Foreign Asset Control and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local equivalents in international jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory investigations or actions, fines, penalties, injunctions and potential criminal prosecution. In addition, increases in the cost and administrative burden of compliance with such laws and regulations may negatively impact us.\nWe have substantial business operations outside the U.S. and we are subject to compliance with significant laws and regulations governing fraud, bribery and other anti-corruption laws.\nLegislation such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, The United Kingdom Bribery Act and other similar fraud, bribery and anti-corruption laws prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to public or private officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business. We have policies and processes in place for the purpose of monitoring compliance with these laws. We provide training to our employees as part of our compliance programs in order to protect against noncompliance or violations of these laws. However, there can be no assurance that our policies, processes, and training will always protect us against any noncompliance with these laws and regulations. Should we violate or not comply with any of these fraud, bribery or other anti-corruption laws or regulations, either intentionally or unintentionally, or through the acts of intermediaries, we could incur significant civil and/or criminal penalties.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.\nOur operations, as well as the operations of our hotel and other property owners, are subject to a significant array of environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges into water, emissions to air, releases of hazardous and toxic substances and remediation of contaminated sites. We could be liable under such laws and regulations for the cost of cleaning up or removing hazardous substances at or in connection with our currently or formerly owned or operated properties, often whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence, discharge or transfer of such hazardous or toxic substances. The cost of investigation, remediation and other requirements for the clean-up, treatment or remediation of contaminated sites could be substantial. Further, contamination on or from any of our currently or formerly owned or operated properties could subject us to liability to third parties or governmental authorities for remediation costs and injuries to persons, property or natural resources. Although we do not typically arrange for the treatment or disposal of large quantities of hazardous or toxic substances, we could also be held liable for the clean-up of third-party disposal sites where we have arranged for the disposal of our wastes.\nOur ability to market successfully our services and products may be adversely impacted by continued changes in privacy laws and regulations.\nOur operating model relies on a broad array of marketing programs to our customers and prospective customers, including telemarketing, emails, social media and other marketing techniques and programs. These marketing programs are subject to extensive laws and regulations in the U.S. and international markets regulating consumer marketing and solicitation as well as data protection. While we continue to monitor all such laws and regulations, the cost of compliance impacts our operating costs. In addition, these laws require us to regularly adjust our marketing programs and techniques, and compliance with all of these laws and regulations may impact and restrict the success of our marketing programs, which could lead to less frequent or less impactful marketing to our customers and our prospective customers.\nFailure to maintain the security of personally identifiable and other information, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such information or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such information could adversely affect us.\nIn June 2012, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a lawsuit against us and our subsidiaries, Wyndham Hotel Group, LLC, Wyndham Hotels & Resorts Inc. (WHR) and Wyndham Hotel Management Inc., alleging unfairness and deception-based violations of Section 5 of the FTC Act in connection with three prior data breach incidents involving a group of Wyndham brand hotels. We disputed the allegations in the lawsuit and defended this lawsuit vigorously. In December 2015, the Federal District Court for the District of New Jersey entered a Stipulated Order for Injunction (Stipulated Order) that was negotiated and agreed to by us and the FTC. The Court also dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice. We did not pay any monetary relief in connection with the Stipulated Order. The Stipulated Order requires WHR to maintain an information security program for payment card information within WHR\u2019s network and provides WHR with a safe harbor provided it continues to meet certain requirements for reasonable data security as outlined in the Stipulated Order. We do not believe that the data breach incidents were or that the Stipulated Order is material to us.\nIn connection with our business, we and our service providers collect and retain large volumes of certain types of personal and proprietary information pertaining to our customers, stockholders and employees. Such information includes but is not limited to large volumes of customer credit and payment card information. The legal, regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security and privacy is constantly evolving and the hospitality industry is under increasing attack by cyber-criminals operating on a global basis.\nOur information technology infrastructure, including but not limited to our information systems and legacy proprietary online reservation and inventory management systems has been and will likely continue to be vulnerable to system failures, computer hacking, cyber-terrorism, computer viruses, and other intentional or unintentional interference, negligence, fraud, misuse and other unauthorized attempts to access or interfere with these systems and our personal and proprietary information. No such incidents have been material to our business to date. The increased scope and complexity of our information technology infrastructure and systems could contribute to the potential risk of security breaches or breakdown. While we maintain what we believe are reasonable security controls over proprietary information as well as the personal information of our customers, stockholders and employees, any breach of or breakdown in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of proprietary or personal information could nevertheless occur and have a material adverse effect on our brands, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as subject us to significant regulatory actions and fines, litigation, loss, third-party damages and other liabilities. Such a breach or a breakdown could also materially increase our costs to protect such information and to protect against such risks. A failure on our part to comply with information security, privacy and other similar laws and regulations with respect to the protection and privacy of personal or proprietary information could subject us to significant fines and other regulatory sanctions.\nThe insurance that we carry may not at all times cover our potential liabilities, losses or replacement costs.\nWe carry insurance for general liability, property, business interruption and other insurable risks with respect to our business and properties. We also self-insure for certain risks up to certain monetary limits. The terms and conditions or the amounts of coverage of our insurance may not at all times be sufficient to pay or reimburse us for the amount of our liabilities, losses or replacement costs, and there may also be risks for which we do not obtain insurance in the full amount concerning a potential loss or liability, or at all, due to the cost or availability of such insurance. As a result, we may incur liabilities or losses in the operation of our business, which may be substantial, which are not sufficiently covered by the insurance we maintain, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect and maintain our intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect and maintain our trademarks, trade dress and other intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected. We generate, maintain, utilize and enforce a substantial portfolio of trademarks, trade dress and other intellectual property that are fundamental to all of our brands. There can be no assurance that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property will be adequate. Any event that materially damages the reputation of one or more of our brands could have an adverse impact on the value of that brand and subsequent revenues from that brand. The value of any brand is influenced by a number of factors including consumer preference and perception and our failure to ensure compliance with brand standards.\nWe rely on information technologies and systems to operate our business, which involves reliance on third-party service providers and uninterrupted operations of service facilities.\nWe rely on information technologies and systems to operate our business, which involves reliance on third-party service providers and uninterrupted operations of service facilities. Any disaster, disruption or other impairment in our technology capabilities and service facilities or those of our vendors could harm our business. Our businesses depend upon the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems, including those utilized for reservation systems, vacation exchange systems, hotel/property management, communications, procurement, member record databases, call centers, operation of our loyalty programs and administrative systems. We also maintain physical facilities to support these systems and related services. The operation, maintenance and updating of these technologies, systems and facilities are dependent upon internal and third-party technologies, systems, services and support and are subject to natural disasters and other disruptions for which there are no assurances of uninterrupted availability or adequate protection.\nWe and our franchisees utilize certain technology platforms for services, including for reservation systems and property management, and in certain instances rely on third party service providers to effectively deliver such services through these technology platforms. Any system error or failure may significantly delay response times or even cause our system to fail. Any disruption in our ability to provide the use of our reservation systems to our customers, including as a result of software or hardware issues related to the reservation system or the actions of third parties, could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm to our reputation and business. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to interruption, malfunction or manipulation, including as the result of natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, data and other security breaches, misuse, break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events. Any interruption, delay or system failure could result in financial losses, customer claims and litigation and damage to our reputation. There can be no assurance that disruptions of the operation of these systems will not occur as a result of failures related to us or our third party providers. The termination of our agreement with our third party provider for our central reservation booking systems and revenue management services may materially harm our business if we were not able to replace the services of the third party provider in a timely manner.\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility.\nMany factors influence our reputation and the value of our brands including the perception held by our key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business. Our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance activities and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if we fail to act responsibly or comply with regulatory requirements in a number of areas such as safety and security, responsible tourism, environmental and availability of resources, supply chain management, climate change, diversity, human rights, philanthropy, and support for local communities.\nThe market price of our shares may fluctuate.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate depending upon many factors some of which may be beyond our control including our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry; actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to seasonality and other factors related to our business; changes in accounting principles or rules;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; the lack of securities analysts covering our common stock; changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates; the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies; overall market fluctuations; and general economic conditions. Stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nYour percentage ownership in Wyndham Worldwide may be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in Wyndham Worldwide may be diluted in the future because of equity awards that we have and expect will be granted over time to our Directors and employees. In addition, our Board may issue shares of our common and preferred stock and debt securities convertible into shares of our common and preferred stock up to certain regulatory thresholds without shareholder approval.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and under Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of Wyndham Worldwide which could impact the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include that stockholders do not have the right to act by written consent, rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings, the right of our Board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and limitations on the right of stockholders to remove directors. Delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or purchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program.\nThere can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash or surplus under Delaware law to be able to continue to pay dividends or purchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. This may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplated costs, funding of capital expenditures, increases in reserves or lack of available capital. Our Board may also suspend the payment of dividends or our stock repurchase program if the Board deems such action to be in the best interests of our stockholders. If we do not pay dividends, the price of our common stock must appreciate for you to realize a gain on your investment in Wyndham Worldwide. This appreciation may not occur and our stock may in fact depreciate in value.\nWe are responsible for certain of Cendant\u2019s contingent and other corporate liabilities.\nUnder the separation agreement and the tax sharing agreement that we executed with Cendant (now Avis Budget Group) and former Cendant units, Realogy and Travelport, we and Realogy generally are responsible for 37.5% and 62.5%, respectively, of certain of Cendant\u2019s contingent and other corporate liabilities and associated costs including certain contingent and other corporate liabilities of Cendant or its subsidiaries to the extent incurred on or prior to August 23, 2006. These liabilities include those relating to certain of Cendant\u2019s terminated or divested businesses, the Travelport sale, certain Cendant-related litigation, actions with respect to the separation plan and payments under certain contracts that were not allocated to any specific party in connection with the separation.\nIf any party responsible for the liabilities described above were to default on its obligations, each non-defaulting party including Avis Budget would be required to pay an equal portion of the amounts in default.
