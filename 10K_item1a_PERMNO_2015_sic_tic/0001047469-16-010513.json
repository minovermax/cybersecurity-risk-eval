{"cik": "1052100", "company": "WADDELL & REED FINANCIAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other risks and uncertainties contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our other SEC filings. The occurrence of one or more of these risks or uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context expressly requires a different reading, when we state that a factor could \"adversely affect us,\" have a \"material adverse effect on our business,\" \"adversely affect our business\" and similar expressions, we mean that the factor could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Information contained in this section may be considered \"forward-looking statements.\" See \"Part I-Forward Looking Statements\" for a discussion of certain qualifications regarding forward-looking statements.\nA Significant Percentage Of Our Assets Under Management Are Distributed Through Our Wholesale Channel, Which Has Higher Redemption Rates Than Our Traditional Advisors Channel. In recent years, we have focused on expanding distribution efforts relating to our Wholesale channel. The percentage of our assets under management in the Wholesale channel has increased from 10% at December 31, 2003 to 44% at December 31, 2015, and the percentage of our total sales represented by the Wholesale channel has increased from 17% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 61% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The success of sales in our Wholesale channel depends upon our maintaining strong relationships with institutional accounts, certain strategic partners and our third party distributors. Many of those distribution sources also offer investors competing funds that are internally or externally managed, which could limit the distribution of our products. The loss of any of these distribution channels and the inability to continue to access new distribution channels could decrease our assets under management and adversely affect our results of operations and growth. There are no assurances that these channels and their client bases will continue to be accessible to us. The loss or diminution of the level of business we do with those providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, especially with the high concentration of assets in certain funds in this channel, namely the Ivy Asset Strategy fund. Compared to the industry average redemption rate of 24.7% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, the Wholesale channel had redemption rates of 43.0% and 34.8% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Redemption rates were 9.1% and 8.3% for our Advisors channel in the same periods, reflecting the higher rate of transferability of investment assets in the Wholesale channel.\nOur Business Is Subject To Substantial Risk From Litigation, Regulatory Investigations And Potential Securities Laws Liability. Many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of litigation, regulatory investigations and/or arbitration, and from time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings in the course of operating our business. We are exposed to liability under federal and state securities laws, other federal and state laws and court decisions, as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, FINRA and other regulatory bodies. We, our subsidiaries, and/or certain of our past and present officers, have been named as parties in legal actions, regulatory investigations and proceedings, and securities arbitrations in the past and have been subject to claims alleging violation of such laws, rules and regulations, which have resulted in the payment of fines and settlements. An adverse resolution of any lawsuit, legal or regulatory proceeding or claim against us could result in substantial costs or reputational harm to us, and have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition to these financial costs and risks, the defense of litigation, regulatory investigations or arbitration may divert resources and management's attention from operations.\nOur Financial Advisors Are Classified As Independent Contractors, And Changes To Their Classification May Increase Our Operating Expenses. From time to time, various legislative or regulatory proposals are introduced at the federal or state levels to change the status of independent contractors' classification to employees for either employment tax purposes (withholding, social security, Medicare and unemployment taxes) or other benefits available to employees. Currently, most individuals are classified as employees or independent contractors for employment tax purposes based on 20 \"common law\" factors, rather than any\ndefinition found in the Internal Revenue Code or Treasury regulations. We classify the majority of our financial advisors as independent contractors for all purposes, including employment tax and employee benefit purposes. There can be no assurance that legislative, judicial or regulatory (including tax) authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations that would change the independent contractor/employee classification of those financial advisors currently doing business with us. The costs associated with potential changes, if any, with respect to these independent contractor classifications could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere May Be Adverse Effects On Our Business If Our Funds' Performance Declines. Success in the investment management and mutual fund businesses is dependent on the investment performance of client accounts relative to market conditions and the performance of competing funds. Good relative performance stimulates sales of the Funds' shares and tends to keep redemptions low. Sales of the Funds' shares in turn generate higher management fees and distribution revenues. Good relative performance also attracts institutional and separate accounts. Conversely, poor relative performance results in decreased sales, increased redemptions of the Funds' shares and the loss of institutional and separate accounts, resulting in decreases in revenues. As of December 31, 2015, 15% our assets under management were concentrated in the Ivy Asset Strategy fund. As a result, our operating results are significantly affected by the performance of that fund and our ability to minimize redemptions from and maintain assets under management in that fund. If a significant amount of investments are withdrawn from that fund for any reason, our revenues would decline and our operating results would be adversely affected. Further, given the size and prominence of the Ivy Asset Strategy fund within our product line, any adverse performance of that fund may also indirectly affect the net sales and redemptions in our other products, which in turn may adversely affect our business.\nThere May Be An Adverse Effect On Our Business If Our Investors Redeem The Assets We Manage On Short Notice. Mutual fund investors may redeem their investments in our mutual funds at any time without any prior notice. Additionally, our investment management agreements with institutions and other non-mutual fund accounts are generally terminable upon relatively short notice. Investors can terminate their relationship with us, reduce their aggregate amount of assets under management, or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates and financial market performance. The risk of our investors to redeeming their investments in our mutual funds on short notice has increased materially due to the growth of assets in our Wholesale channel and the high concentration of assets in certain funds in this channel, including the Ivy Asset Strategy fund. The decrease in revenues that could result from any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe May Not Reduce Our Expenses Rapidly Enough To Align With Decreases In Our Revenues. We expect that, as we transition our load-waived Class A shares to Class I shares in our investments advisory products, our operating revenue will be significantly lower in 2016. If we are unable to effect appropriate expense reductions in a timely manner through operational changes or performance improvement initiatives in response to this expected decline in our revenues or due to, among other things, the level of our assets under management or our current business environment, our business may be adversely affected.\nRegulatory Risk Is Substantial In Our Business And Non-Compliance With Regulations, Or Changes In Regulations, Could Have A Significant Impact On The Conduct Of Our Business, Reputation And Prospects. Our investment advisory and broker/dealer businesses are heavily regulated, primarily at the federal level. Non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in sanctions being levied against us, including fines and censures, suspension or expulsion from a certain jurisdiction or market, or the revocation of licenses. Non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations could also adversely affect our business, reputation and prospects. In addition, changes in current legal, regulatory, accounting, tax or compliance requirements or in governmental policies could adversely affect our operations, revenues and\nearnings by, among other things, increasing expenses and reducing investor interest in certain products we offer. Distribution fees paid to mutual fund distributors in accordance with Rule 12b-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (\"Rule 12b-1\"), are an important element of the distribution of the mutual funds we manage. In 2010, the SEC proposed replacing Rule 12b-1 with a new regulation that would significantly change current fund distribution practices in the industry. If this proposed regulation is adopted, it may have a material impact on the compensation we pay to distributors for distributing the mutual funds we manage and/or our ability to recover expenses related to the distribution of our funds, and thus could materially affect our business. In 2015, the U.S. Department of Labor (the \"DOL\") proposed regulations to expand the scope of a \"fiduciary\" under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\"ERISA\"), and Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), which, if enacted, would impact how advice can be provided to retirement account holders in 401(k) plans, individual retirement accounts and other qualified retirement programs. The DOL proposal also would create new exemptions and amend existing exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules applicable to fiduciaries under ERISA and the Code that would allow broker/dealers, investment advisers and others to continue to receive a variety of common forms of compensation that otherwise would be prohibited as conflicts of interest. If the proposed regulations are enacted, they may have a material impact on the provision of investment services to retirement accounts, including imposing additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements, which could negatively affect our business. Additionally, our profitability could be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing state and federal taxation.\nOur Business And Prospects Could Be Adversely Affected If The Securities Markets Decline. Our results of operations are affected by certain economic factors, including the success of the securities markets. Adverse market conditions, particularly the U.S. domestic stock market due to our high concentration of assets under management in that market, and lack of investor confidence could result in investors further withdrawing from the markets or decreasing their rate of investment, either of which could adversely affect our revenues, earnings and growth prospects to a greater extent. Because our revenues are, to a large extent, investment management fees that are based on the value of assets under management, a decline in the value of these assets adversely affects our revenues and earnings. Our growth is dependent to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain mutual fund assets, and, in an adverse economic environment, this may prove more difficult. Our growth rate has varied from year to year and there can be no assurance that our average growth rates sustained in recent years will continue. Declines in the securities markets could significantly reduce our future revenues and earnings. In addition, a decline in the market value of these assets could cause our clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments they perceive as offering greater opportunity or lower risk, which could also negatively impact our revenues and earnings. The combination of adverse market conditions reducing sales and investment management fees could compound on each other and materially affect our business.\nOur Ability To Hire And Retain Senior Executive Management And Other Key Personnel Is Significant To Our Success And Growth. Our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to attract and retain qualified senior executive management and other key personnel to conduct our broker/dealer, fund management and investment advisory businesses. The market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, financial advisors and wholesalers is extremely competitive. Additionally, we are dependent on our financial advisors and select wholesale distributors to sell our mutual funds and other investment products. Our growth prospects will be directly affected by the quality, quantity and productivity of financial advisors and wholesalers we are able to successfully recruit and retain. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel.\nA Failure In Or Breach Of Our Operational Or Security Systems Or Our Technology Infrastructure, Or Those Of Third Parties, Could Result In A Material Adverse Effect On Our Business And Reputation. We are highly dependent upon the use of various proprietary and third party software applications and other technology\nsystems to operate our business. As part of our normal operations, we process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and maintain and transmit confidential client and employee information, the safety and security of which is dependent upon the effectiveness of our information security policies, procedures and capabilities to protect such systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them.\nAlthough we take protective measures and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, technology is subject to rapid change and the nature of the threats continue to evolve. As a result, our operating and technology systems, software and networks may fail to operate properly or become disabled, or may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, inadvertent disclosure, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber attacks and other events that could materially damage our operations, have an adverse security impact, or cause the disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential information. Most of the software applications that we use in our business are licensed from, and supported, upgraded and maintained by, third party vendors. A suspension or termination of certain of these licenses or the related support, upgrades and maintenance could cause temporary system delays or interruption. We also take precautions to password protect and/or encrypt our laptops and other mobile electronic hardware. If such hardware is stolen, misplaced or left unattended, it may become vulnerable to hacking or other unauthorized use, creating a possible security risk and resulting in potentially costly actions by us. Further, while we have in place a disaster recovery plan to address catastrophic and unpredictable events, there is no guarantee that this plan will be sufficient in responding to or ameliorating the effects of all disaster scenarios, and we may experience system delays and interruptions as a result of natural disasters, power failures, acts of war, and third party failures.\nThe breach of our operational or security systems or our technology infrastructure, or those of third parties, due to one or more of these events could cause interruptions, malfunctions or failures in our operations and/or the loss or inadvertent disclosure of confidential client information could result in substantial financial loss or costs, liability for stolen assets or information, breach of client contracts, client dissatisfaction and/or loss, regulatory actions, remediation costs to repair damage caused by the breach, additional security costs to mitigate against future incidents and litigation costs resulting from the incident. These events, and those discussed above, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nThere Is No Assurance That New Information Technology Systems Will Be Implemented Successfully. A number of our key information technology systems were developed solely to handle our particular information technology infrastructure. We are in the process of implementing new information technology systems that we believe could facilitate and improve our core businesses and our productivity. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing the new information technology systems or that their implementation will be completed in a timely or cost effective manner. Failure to implement or maintain adequate information technology infrastructure could impede our ability to support business growth.\nSupport Provided To New Products May Reduce Fee Revenue, Increase Expenses And Expose Us To Potential Loss On Invested Capital. We may support the development of new investment products by waiving a portion of the fees we usually receive for managing such products, by subsidizing expenses or by making seed capital investments. There can be no assurance that new investment products we develop will be successful, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Failure to have or devote sufficient capital to support new products could have an adverse impact on our future growth. Seed capital investments in new products utilize Company capital that would otherwise be available for general corporate purposes and expose us to capital losses due to investment market risk. Our non-operating investment and other income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon the disposition of our investments or the recognition of significant other-than-temporary impairments in the case of our available-for-sale portfolio and the recognition of unrealized losses related to our sponsored investment\nportfolios that are held as trading and accounted for under the equity method. We may use various derivative instruments to mitigate the risk of our seed capital investments, although some market risk would remain. The risk of loss may be greater for seed capital investments that are not hedged, or if an intended hedge does not perform as expected. Our use of derivatives would result in counterparty risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties to these derivative instruments, regulatory risk and the risk that the underlying positions do not move identically to the related derivative instruments. As a result, volatility in the capital markets may affect the value of our seed capital investments, which may increase the volatility of our earnings and adversely affect our business.\nExpansion Into International Markets May Increase Operational And Regulatory Risks. As we broaden our distribution globally, we face increased operational and regulatory risks. The failure of our systems of internal control to properly mitigate such additional risks, or of our operating infrastructure to support such international expansion could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions. Local regulatory environments may vary widely and place additional demands on our sales, legal and compliance personnel. Identifying and hiring well qualified personnel and adopting policies, procedures and controls to address local or regional requirements require time and resources. Regulators in non-U.S. jurisdictions could also change their policies or laws in a manner that might restrict or otherwise impede our ability to offer our investment strategies in their respective markets. Any of these local requirements, activities or needs could increase the costs and expenses we incur in a specific jurisdiction without any corresponding increase in revenues and income from operating in the jurisdiction.\nWe Have Substantial Intangibles On Our Balance Sheet, And Any Impairment Of Our Intangibles Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations. At December 31, 2015, our total assets were approximately $1.6 billion, of which approximately $158.1 million, or 10%, consisted of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. We complete an ongoing review of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or a change in circumstances warrant. Important factors in determining whether an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets might exist include significant continued underperformance compared to peers, the likelihood of termination or non-renewal of a mutual fund advisory or subadvisory contract or substantial changes in revenues earned from such contracts, significant changes in our business and products, material and ongoing negative industry or economic trends, or other factors specific to each asset or subsidiary being tested. Because of the significance of goodwill and other intangibles to our consolidated balance sheets, the impairment analysis is critical. Any changes in key assumptions about our business and our prospects, or changes in market conditions or other externalities, could result in an impairment charge. Any such charge could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nThere May Be Adverse Effects On Our Business Upon The Termination Of, Or Failure To Renew, Certain Agreements. A majority of our revenues are derived from investment management agreements with the Funds that, as required by law, are terminable on 60 days' notice. Each investment management agreement must be approved and renewed annually by the disinterested members of each Fund's board of trustees or its shareholders, as required by law. Additionally, our investment management agreements provide for automatic termination in the event of assignment, which includes a change of control, without the consent of our clients and, in the case of the Funds, approval of the Funds' board of directors/trustees and shareholders to continue the agreements. There can be no assurances that our clients will consent to any assignment of our investment management agreements, or that those and other contracts will not be terminated or will be renewed on favorable terms, if at all, at their expiration and new agreements may not be available. See \"Business-Distribution Channels-Wholesale Channel, Institutional Channel.\" The decrease in revenues that could result from any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRegulations Restricting The Use Of \"Soft Dollars\" Could Result In An Increase In Our Expenses. On behalf of our mutual fund and investment advisory clients, we make decisions to buy and sell securities for each\nportfolio, select broker/dealers to execute trades, and negotiate brokerage commission rates. In connection with these transactions, we may receive \"soft dollar credits\" from broker/dealers that we can use to defray certain of our expenses. If regulations are adopted eliminating the ability of asset managers to use \"soft dollars,\" our operating expenses could increase.\nFee Pressures Could Reduce Our Revenues And Profitability. There is a trend toward lower fees in some segments of the investment management business. In addition, the SEC has adopted rules that are designed to improve mutual fund corporate governance, which could result in further downward pressure on investment advisory fees in the mutual fund industry. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or future new business could adversely affect us.\nChallenges To Our Tax Positions May Adversely Affect Our Effective Tax Rate and Business. The application of complex tax laws and regulations involves numerous uncertainties. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax positions that we have taken and assess additional taxes, which could result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect our effective tax rate and business.\nWe Could Experience Adverse Effects On Our Market Share Due To Strong Competition From Numerous And Sometimes Larger Companies. We compete with stock brokerage firms, mutual fund companies, investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks, internet investment sites, and other financial institutions and individual registered investment advisers. Many of these companies not only offer mutual fund investments and services, but also offer an ever-increasing number of other financial products and services. Many of our competitors have more products and product lines, services and brand recognition and may also have substantially greater assets under management. Many larger mutual fund complexes have developed more extensive relationships with brokerage houses with large distribution networks, which may enable those fund complexes to reach broader client bases. In recent years, there has been a trend of consolidation in the mutual fund industry resulting in stronger competitors with greater financial resources than us. There has also been a trend toward online internet financial services. If existing or potential customers decide to invest with our competitors instead of with us, our market share could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Terms Of Our Credit Facility And Senior Unsecured Notes Impose Restrictions On Our Operations That May Adversely Impact Our Prospects And The Operations Of Our Business. There are no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed, which could negatively impact our liquidity, prospects and operations. We have entered into a 5-year revolving credit facility with various lenders providing for total availability of $125.0 million. Under this facility, the lenders may, at their option upon our request, expand the facility to $200.0 million. At February 12, 2016, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. We also entered into a note purchase agreement with various purchasers for the sale and issuance of $190.0 million of unsecured senior notes comprised of $95 million of 5.0% senior notes, series A, due 2018 and $95 million of 5.75% senior notes, series B, due 2021, all of which were issued on January 13, 2011. The terms and conditions of our revolving credit facility and note purchase agreement impose restrictions that affect, among other things, our ability to incur additional debt, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, merge, sell assets, pay dividends and create or incur liens. Our ability to comply with the financial covenants set forth in our credit facility and note purchase agreement could be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve operating results that will comply with such terms and conditions, a breach of which could result in a default under our credit facility and note purchase agreement. In the event of a default under the credit facility and/or note purchase agreement, the banks could elect to declare the outstanding principal amount of our credit facility, all interest thereon, and all other amounts payable under our credit facility to be immediately due and payable, and the Company's obligations under the senior unsecured notes could be accelerated and become due and payable, including any make-whole amount, respectively.\nOur ability to meet our cash needs and satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, asset values, the perception of our creditworthiness and, indirectly, the market value of our stock. These factors will be affected by prevailing economic, financial and business conditions and other circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. We anticipate that any funds generated by the issuance of our senior unsecured notes and any borrowings from our existing credit facility and/or cash provided by operating activities will provide sufficient funds to finance our business plans, meet our operating expenses and service our debt obligations as they become due. However, in the event that we require additional capital, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such capital when needed or on satisfactory terms, if at all, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew or refinance our credit facility or senior unsecured notes upon their maturity or on favorable terms. If we are unable to raise capital or obtain financing, we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business plan.\nOur Own Operational Failures Or Those Of Third Parties We Rely On, Including Failures Arising Out Of Human Error, Could Disrupt Our Business And Damage Our Reputation. Our business is highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, large numbers of transactions. These transactions generally must comply with client investment guidelines, as well as stringent legal and regulatory standards. Despite our employees being highly trained and skilled, due to the large number of transactions we process errors may occur. If we make mistakes in performing our services that cause financial harm to our clients, our clients may seek to recover their losses. The occurrence of mistakes, particularly significant ones, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nPotential Misuse Of Funds And Information In The Possession Of Our Employees And/Or Advisors Could Result In Liability To Our Clients, Subject Us To Regulatory Sanctions Or Otherwise Adversely Affect Our Business. Our business is based on the trust and confidence of our clients, for whom our financial advisors handle a significant amount of funds, as well as financial and personal information. Although we have implemented a system of internal controls to minimize the risk of fraudulent taking or misuse of funds and confidential information, there can be no assurance that our controls will be adequate or that a taking or misuse of funds and confidential information by our employees or financial advisors can be prevented. We could be liable in the event of a taking or misuse of funds and confidential information by our employees or financial advisors and we could also be subject to regulatory sanctions. Although we believe that we have adequately insured against these risks, there can be no assurance that our insurance will be maintained or that it will be adequate to meet any liability resulting from these activities. Any damage to the trust and confidence placed in us by our clients may cause our assets under management to decline, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nThere Are No Assurances That We Will Pay Future Dividends, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Stock Price. The Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. Board of Directors (the \"Board of Directors\") currently intends to continue to declare quarterly dividends on our Class A common stock. However, the declaration and payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. Any determination as to the payment of dividends, as well as the level of such dividends, will depend on, among other things, general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans, our financial results and condition, and contractual, legal, and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by us or our subsidiaries. We are a holding company and, as such, our ability to pay dividends is subject to the ability of our subsidiaries to provide us with cash. There can be no assurance that the current quarterly dividend level will be maintained or that we will pay any dividends in any future period. Any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment of dividends could adversely affect our stock price.\nOur Stockholders Rights Plan Could Deter Takeover Attempts, Which Some Of Our Stockholders May Believe To Be In Their Best Interest. Under certain conditions, the rights under our stockholders rights plan entitle the holders of such rights to receive shares of our common stock having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the right. The rights are attached to each share of our outstanding common stock and generally are exercisable only if a person or group acquires 15% or more of the voting power represented\nby our common stock. Our stockholders rights plan could impede the completion of a merger, tender offer, or other takeover attempt even though some or a majority of our stockholders might believe that a merger, tender offer or takeover is in their best interests, and even if such a transaction could result in our stockholders receiving a premium for their shares of our stock over the then current market price of our stock.\nProvisions Of Our Organizational Documents Could Deter Takeover Attempts, Which Some Of Our Stockholders May Believe To Be In Their Best Interest. Under our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Board of Directors has the authority, without action by our stockholders, to fix certain terms and issue shares of our Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share. Actions of our Board of Directors pursuant to this authority may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of the Company. Other provisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and in our Amended and Restated Bylaws impose procedural and other requirements that could be deemed to have anti-takeover effects, including replacing incumbent directors. Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, each of which is to serve for a staggered three-year term after the initial classification and election, and incumbent directors may not be removed without cause, all of which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Board of Directors. In addition, as a Delaware corporation we are subject to section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. With certain exceptions, section 203 imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our voting stock.\nOur Holding Company Structure Results In Structural Subordination And May Affect Our Ability To Fund Our Operations And Make Payments On Our Debt. We are a holding company and, accordingly, substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. As a result, our cash flow and our ability to service our debt, including $190.0 million of our senior notes, are dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of earnings, loans or other payments by our subsidiaries to us. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt or provide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments. In addition, any payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions. Payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries' earnings and business considerations. Our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization, and therefore the right of the holders of our debt to participate in those assets, would be effectively subordinated to the claims of those subsidiaries' creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if we were a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be effectively subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us.", "PERMNO": 86380, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "WDR"}
