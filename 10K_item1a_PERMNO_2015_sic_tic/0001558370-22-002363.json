Risk Factors.\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including under the heading \u201cSummary of Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report, should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. Please see page 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the forward-looking statements that are qualified by these risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Coronavirus Pandemic\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our operations, including our commercialization of DEXTENZA, our ability to generate revenue from sales of DEXTENZA and ReSure Sealant, and our enrollment of certain clinical trials. In the future, the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics may have other adverse effects on our business, operations and ability to raise capital.\nThe COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, which began in December 2019 and has spread worldwide, has caused many governments to implement measures to slow the spread of the pandemic through quarantines, strict travel restrictions, heightened border scrutiny, and other measures. The pandemic and government measures taken in response have also had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services, such as medical services and supplies, has spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, has fallen. As the recent resurgence of cases due to the delta and omicron variants have illustrated, the future progression of the pandemic and its effects on our business and operations are uncertain.\nWe believe the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and we expect it to continue to adversely affect, our commercialization of DEXTENZA and our ability to generate revenue from sales of DEXTENZA, as a result of many factors, including:\n\u25cf a decrease in patients attending routine ophthalmology appointments or undergoing elective surgical procedures, including cataract surgery;\n\u25cf diversion of healthcare resources away from elective surgical procedures, including cataract surgery, to focus on pandemic concerns;\n\u25cf government and institutional restrictions limiting the ability of our key account managers to conduct sales activities or access accounts and healthcare professionals, which could adversely impact our commercialization of DEXTENZA;\n\u25cf limitations of employees being able to fulfill their job requirements because they have chosen or may choose not to be vaccinated;\n\u25cf challenges in retaining and recruiting key personnel in certain operations of our business; and\n\u25cf potential interruptions in global shipping affecting the transport of raw materials used in the manufacture of our product, drug product, patient samples and related literature and similar issues related to current economy-wide supply chain concerns.\nWhile we saw improvement in certain of these factors earlier in 2021 as a result of the increased availability of vaccines and a reduction in COVID-19 infections in the United States, we saw the renewed impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the second half of 2021 with the surges of the delta and omicron variants. Elective ophthalmology surgeries declined during the periods of these surges, which we believe led to slower than expected in-market sales of DEXTENZA during both the third and fourth quarters of 2021.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has delayed, and has the potential to further delay or otherwise adversely affect, our clinical development activities, including our ability to recruit or retain subjects in and otherwise conduct our ongoing clinical trials, as a result of many factors, including:\n\u25cf diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of our clinical trials to focus on pandemic concerns, including the availability of necessary materials, the attention of physicians serving as our clinical trial investigators, access to hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites, and availability of hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf the inability or reluctance of subjects enrolled in our clinical trials to visit clinical trial sites if subjects are affected by the virus or are fearful of traveling to our clinical trial sites because of the pandemic;\n\u25cf potential interruptions in global shipping affecting the transport of clinical trial materials, such as investigational drug product, patient samples, and raw materials used in the manufacture of our product candidates; medical and laboratory supplies used in our clinical trials or preclinical studies; or animals that are used for preclinical testing, and other supplies used in our clinical trials and preclinical studies;\n\u25cf the impact of personnel shortages, further limitations on travel, or other operational challenges that could interrupt key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site initiations and monitoring and reporting activities, travel by our employees, contract research organizations, or CROs, or patients to clinical trial sites, or the ability of employees at our manufacturing facility to report to work, any of which could delay or adversely impact the conduct or progress of our clinical trials or limit the amount of clinical data we will be able to report;\n\u25cf potential interruptions in the operations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, or other regulatory authorities, which could delay or adversely impact the review of any investigational new drug, or IND, application or new drug application, or NDA, we submit to the FDA or such other regulatory authorities or delay our ability to discuss and receive guidance on the clinical development of our product candidates; and\n\u25cf any future interruption of, or delays in receiving, supplies of clinical trial material from our manufacturing facility due to stay-at-home orders, production slowdowns or stoppages, or disruptions in delivery systems.\nIf delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic affect the enrollment of any of our ongoing or planned clinical trials, as they did for our Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating OTX-TIC, the completion of such trials could be delayed. We are currently experiencing slow enrollment of the fourth cohort in our OTX-TKI Phase 1 clinical trial due to COVID-19 restrictions in Australia.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted, and may in the future impact, the administration of our clinical trials. In May 2020, we disclosed the receipt of interim data regarding our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of OTX-TKI for the potential treatment of wet AMD and other retinal diseases. Subsequently, we learned that the data collection and other administrative activities of a clinical trial site in Australia had been adversely impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the site had, as a result, erroneously reported the status of a subject to us because certain information had not been entered into the clinical trial database in a timely manner. In July 2020, we reported the updated data.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and its ultimate scope, duration and effects are unknown. The extent of the impact on our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials, commercialization activities and revenue will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. These include, but are not limited to, the duration of the pandemic; actions to contain the pandemic or treat its impact, such as travel restrictions, vaccination campaigns, social distancing, masking requirements and quarantines or lock-downs in the United States and other countries; staffing shortages in the healthcare industry; business closures or business disruptions; and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.\nWe cannot be certain what the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic will be on our business or as to its potential to continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have a history of incurring significant losses. We expect to incur losses over the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have a history of incurring significant losses. Our net loss was $155.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a loss from operations of $62.8 million and a change in fair value of a derivative liability of $86.2 million. Our net loss was $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a loss from operations of $78.0 million offset by a change in fair value of a derivative liability of $78.1 million. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $545.8 million. We have financed our operations primarily through sales of our products, private placements of our preferred stock, public offerings of our common stock, the private placement of convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of our $37.5 million, or the Convertible Notes, and borrowings under credit facilities. We have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development, including preclinical studies and clinical trials, and the commercialization of DEXTENZA\u00ae for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery and ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Although we expect to continue to generate revenue from sales of DEXTENZA, we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nWe anticipate we will incur substantial expenses if and as we:\n\u25cf continue to commercialize DEXTENZA in the United States, including the commercial launch of DEXTENZA in the office setting for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis;\n\u25cf continue to develop and expand our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for DEXTENZA and any other products or product candidates we intend to commercialize;\n\u25cf continue ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates OTX-TKI (in both Australia and the United States) for the treatment of wet AMD and OTX-TIC for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and our ongoing clinical trial to evaluate DEXTENZA in pediatric subjects following cataract surgery in accordance with the FDA\u2019s post-approval requirement;\n\u25cf determine to initiate new clinical trials to evaluate OTX-TKI for the treatment of wet AMD, OTX-CSI for the chronic treatment of dry eye disease and OTX-DED for the short-term treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease and to initiate a new clinical trial to evaluate DEXTENZA in pediatric subjects with ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis in accordance with the FDA\u2019s post-approval requirement;\n\u25cf conduct or support research and development activities on, and seek regulatory approvals for, DEXTENZA and OTX-TIC in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea and the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations pursuant to our license agreement and collaboration with AffaMed Therapeutics Limited, or AffaMed;\n\u25cf continue the research and development of our other product candidates;\n\u25cf seek to identify and develop additional product candidates;\n\u25cf seek marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical development;\n\u25cf scale up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to support sales of commercial products, clinical trials of our product candidates and commercialization of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, and expand our facilities to accommodate this scale up and any corresponding growth in personnel;\n\u25cf renovate our existing facilities including research and development laboratories, manufacturing space and office space;\n\u25cf maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u25cf expand our operational, financial, administrative and management systems and personnel, including personnel to support our clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts;\n\u25cf defend ourselves against legal proceedings;\n\u25cf make investments to improve our defenses against cybersecurity and establish and maintain cybersecurity insurance;\n\u25cf increase our product liability and clinical trial insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials and commercialization efforts; and\n\u25cf continue to operate as a public company.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. Our development expenses will increase if:\n\u25cf we are required by the FDA or the other regulatory authorities such as the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, to perform trials or studies in addition to those currently expected;\n\u25cf there are any delays in receipt of regulatory clearance to begin our planned clinical programs;\n\u25cf there are any delays in enrollment of subjects in or completion of our clinical trials or the development of our product candidates; or\n\u25cf there are any delays in receiving marketing approval of any of our product candidates.\nFor us to become and remain profitable, we will need to continue to successfully commercialize DEXTENZA and to successfully develop and commercialize other products with significant market potential. This will require us or our current or future collaborators to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including:\n\u25cf continuing to commercialize DEXTENZA in the United States, including by further developing our manufacturing, marketing, sales force, and distribution capabilities;\n\u25cf completing clinical development of our product candidates, including OTX-TKI, OTX-TIC, OTX-CSI and OTX-DED;\n\u25cf obtaining marketing approval for these product candidates;\n\u25cf manufacturing, marketing, selling and distributing any other products for which we obtain marketing approval;\n\u25cf achieving an adequate level of market acceptance of and obtaining and maintaining coverage and adequate reimbursement from CMS and other third-party payors for our products; and\n\u25cf protecting our rights to our intellectual property portfolio.\nEven if we succeed in our commercialization efforts, we may never generate revenue that is sufficient to achieve profitability. We do not anticipate revenue from sales of DEXTENZA for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery and ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis will be sufficient for us to become profitable for several years, if ever.\nEven if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investment.\nWe will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect to devote substantial financial resources to our ongoing and planned activities, particularly as we continue to commercialize DEXTENZA for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery, begin to commercialize DEXTENZA for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis, and advance OTX-TKI, OTX-TIC, OTX-CSI and OTX-DED through clinical development. We expect to devote substantial financial resources as we conduct late-stage clinical trials for our product candidates, seek marketing approval for any such product candidate for which we obtain favorable pivotal clinical results, and commercialize any products for which we receive marketing approval. In addition, we plan to devote significant financial resources to conduct research and development of our other product candidates. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding to fully support our continuing and planned operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or commercialization efforts.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $164.2 million, outstanding debt of $25.0 million, net of unamortized discount, and $37.5 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes plus accrued interest of $6.5 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our planned operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements through 2023. This estimate is based on our current operating plan which includes estimates of anticipated cash inflows from product sales and cash outflows from operating expenses. These estimates are subject to various assumptions including those related to the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the commercialization of DEXTENZA, the pace of our research and clinical development programs and other aspects of our business. Our assumptions may prove to be wrong, and we could use our\ncapital resources sooner than we currently expect and would therefore need to raise additional capital sooner or adjust our plans accordingly. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf the level of product sales from DEXTENZA and any additional products for which we obtain marketing approval in the future and the level of third-party reimbursement of such products;\n\u25cf the costs of sales, marketing, distribution and other commercialization efforts with respect to DEXTENZA and any additional products for which we obtain marketing approval in the future, including costs increases due to inflation;\n\u25cf the progress, costs and outcome of our clinical trials of our product candidates, in particular OTX-TIC for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and OTX-TKI for the treatment of wet AMD;\n\u25cf the scope, progress, costs and outcome of preclinical development and clinical trials of our other product candidates;\n\u25cf the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates by the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf the costs of scaling up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to support sales of commercial products, clinical trials of our product candidates and commercialization of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval and of expanding our facilities to accommodate this scale up and any corresponding growth in personnel;\n\u25cf the extent of our debt service obligations and our ability, if desired, to refinance any of our existing debt on terms that are more favorable to us;\n\u25cf the amounts we are entitled to receive, if any, as reimbursements for clinical trial expenditures, development, regulatory, and sales milestone payments, and royalty payments under our license agreement with AffaMed;\n\u25cf the extent to which we choose to establish additional collaboration, distribution or other marketing arrangements for our products and product candidates;\n\u25cf the costs and outcomes of any legal actions and proceedings;\n\u25cf the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; and\n\u25cf the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses, products and technologies.\nConducting preclinical testing and clinical trials, seeking market approvals and commercializing products are time-consuming, expensive and uncertain processes that take years to complete. We may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory approval of products with the market potential sufficient to enable us to generate significant revenues from the sale of such products. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or products or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate product revenues sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, royalty agreements, and marketing and distribution arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds, although our license agreement with AffaMed provides for AffaMed\u2019s reimbursement of certain clinical expenses incurred by us in connection with our collaboration and for our potential receipt of development and sales milestone payments and royalty payments. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of\nequity, preferred equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders\u2019 ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our existing stockholders\u2019 rights as holders of our common stock. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Our pledge of our assets as collateral to secure our obligations under our Credit Facility pursuant to which we have a total borrowing capacity of $25.0 million, which has been fully drawn down, may limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, royalty agreements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, products or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOur substantial indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business.\nUnder our credit facility, or the Credit Facility, we have $25.0 million, net of unamortized discount, of outstanding principal indebtedness. Under the accompanying credit and security agreement, as amended and/or restated to date, which we refer to as the Credit Agreement, we are permitted to make interest-only payments through April 2024, at which time we will be required to make, in addition to the monthly interest payments, principal payments on the term loans in accordance with the amortization schedules set forth in the Credit Agreement. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by all of our assets, including our intellectual property. The Credit Agreement also includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on dispositions, mergers or acquisitions; incurring indebtedness, liens or encumbrances; paying dividends; making certain investments; and engaging in certain other business transactions. In March 2019, we issued $37.5 million aggregate principal amount of issued and outstanding Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes mature on March 1, 2026 and interest on the Convertible Notes is payable at maturity or if earlier converted, repurchased or redeemed pursuant to their terms. We could in the future incur additional indebtedness beyond such amounts, including by potentially amending our Credit Agreement.\nOur substantial debt combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments could have significant adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities to the payment of interest on, and principal of, our debt, which would reduce the amounts available to fund working capital, commercialization expenditures, capital expenditures, product development efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf obligating us to additional negative covenants further restricting our activities;\n\u25cf limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and\n\u25cf placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or better debt servicing options.\nWe intend to satisfy our current and future debt service obligations with our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated product revenue from DEXTENZA and funds from external sources. However, we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to pay the amounts due under our existing debt. Funds from external sources may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nA failure to comply with conditions of our Credit Agreement or the Convertible Notes could result in an event of default under those instruments. In the event of an acceleration of amounts due under our Credit Agreement or the Convertible Notes as a result of an event of default, including upon the occurrence of an event that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, properties, assets or condition or a failure to pay any amount due, we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to repay our\nindebtedness or to make any accelerated payments, and the lenders could seek to enforce security interests in the collateral securing such indebtedness.\nThe elimination of LIBOR could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, announced plans to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. In November 2020, the International Exchange Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, announced its decision to consult on ceasing the publication of rates for certain short-term LIBOR tenors effective December 31, 2021, and for the remaining tenors effective June 30, 2023. Financial regulatory authorities including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the FCA expressed support for announcement. Although the impact is uncertain at this time, the elimination of LIBOR could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We may incur significant expenses to amend our LIBOR-indexed loans and other applicable financial or contractual obligations, including our Credit Facility, to a new reference rate, which may differ significantly from LIBOR. Accordingly, the use of an alternative rate could result in increased costs, including increased interest expense on our credit facilities, and increased borrowing and hedging costs in the future. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR and we are unable to predict the effect of any such alternatives on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe might not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $423.6 million and $297.0 million, respectively. The federal and state NOLs generated for annual periods prior to January 1, 2018 begin to expire in 2026. Our federal NOLs generated for the years ended after December 31, 2018, which amounted to a total of $297.8 million, can be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2021, we also had available research and development tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $10.9 million and $6.1 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2025, respectively. These NOL and tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset our future income tax liabilities. As described below under the heading \u201cChanges in tax laws or in their implementation or interpretation may adversely affect our business and financial condition,\u201d the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the 2017 Tax Act, as amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates and the rules governing NOL carryforwards that may significantly impact our ability to utilize our NOLs to offset taxable income in the future. Nor is it clear how various states will respond to the 2017 Tax Act; the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, or FFCR Act; or the CARES Act. In addition, state NOLs generated in one state cannot be used to offset income generated in another state. Furthermore, the use of NOL carryforwards may become subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and similar state provisions in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant shareholders in excess of 50 percent over a three-year period. This could limit the amount of NOL carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of a company immediately prior to the ownership change. We have not conducted a full study to assess whether a change of control has occurred or whether there have been multiple changes of control since inception due to the significant complexity and cost associated with such a study. As a result, we are uncertain as to whether we have completed one or more transactions since our inception which may have resulted in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. In addition, there may be changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, that could result in ownership changes in the future. For these reasons, even if we attain profitability, we may be unable to use a material portion of our NOLs and other tax attributes.\nRisks Related to Product Development\nClinical trials of our product candidates may not be successful. If clinical trials of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be delayed or unable to complete, the development and commercialization of such product candidate and our business may be harmed.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our\nproduct candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later stage clinical trials, interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results and results from one completed clinical trial may not be replicated in a subsequent clinical trial with a similar study design. Some of our completed studies were conducted with small patient populations, making it difficult to predict whether the favorable results that we observed in such studies will be repeated in larger and more advanced clinical trials. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. The protocols for our clinical trials and other supporting information are subject to review by the FDA and regulatory authorities outside the United States. However, the FDA is not obligated to comment on our trial protocols within any specified time period or at all or to affirmatively clear or approve our planned pivotal clinical trials. Subject to a waiting period of 30 days, we could choose to initiate our pivotal clinical trials in the United States without waiting for any additional period for comments from the FDA.\nWe have devoted a significant portion of our financial resources and business efforts to the development of DEXTENZA and our product candidates. We are currently investing substantial resources to advance the development of OTX-TKI for the treatment of wet AMD, OTX-TIC for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, OTX-CSI for the chronic treatment of dry eye disease, and OTX-DED for the short-term treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. We currently have several ongoing clinical trials, including our Phase 1 clinical trials of OTX-TKI in Australia and the United States and our Phase 2 clinical trial of OTX-TIC.\nWe have, however, experienced the uncertainty of clinical trials in our own development programs. In our Phase 2 clinical trial for OTX-CSI for the treatment of dry eye disease, for example, OTX-CSI did not meet the primary endpoint of the clinical trial. The Phase 2, U.S.-based, randomized, double-masked, multi-center, vehicle-controlled clinical trial was designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, durability, and efficacy of two different formulations of OTX-CSI by measuring signs and symptoms of dry eye disease in 140 subjects treated in both eyes over approximately 16 weeks (a 12-week study period, with an additional 4-week safety follow-up). The four groups evaluated in this study were: OTX-CSI for a shorter duration, OTX-CSI for a longer duration, vehicle insert for a longer duration and vehicle insert for a very short duration. The study did not show separation between the OTX-CSI treated subjects (both formulations) and the vehicle treated subjects (both formulations) for the primary endpoint of increased tear production at 12 weeks as measured by the Schirmer\u2019s Test. We are continuing to review the Phase 2 data, including baseline characteristics of the subject population and retention data showing lower than anticipated insert retention rates in the active drug groups, and to assess the impact and reasons for lower than expected retention rates before determining next steps for this program.\nIf clinical trials of any product candidate that we develop fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce clear or favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of such product candidate. We cannot accurately predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or whether our product candidates will receive marketing approval or reach successful commercialization. Our ability to generate product revenues sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on our development and commercialization of products with significant market potential.\nIf we experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with our clinical trials, potential marketing approval or commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u25cf clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u25cf the number of subjects required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u25cf our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u25cf regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u25cf we may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u25cf we may decide, or regulators or institutional review boards may require us, to suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u25cf the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate; and\n\u25cf the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate.\nFrom time to time, we may decide to conduct clinical trials to assess subjects\u2019 clinical response to treatment and choose not to power such trials to measure the applicable efficacy endpoints with statistical significance, as we did in our Phase 2 clinical trials of our former product candidate OTX-TP for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In addition, post-hoc analyses such as those that we performed on certain results of Phase 2 clinical trials of OTX-TP may not be predictive of success in future clinical trials, including as a result of differences in trial design. Post-hoc analyses performed using an unlocked clinical trial database can also result in the introduction of bias and are given less weight by regulatory authorities than pre-specified analyses.\nThe FDA may also require that NDA submissions for our product candidates include pediatric data. We applied for a deferral from the FDA for this requirement for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery until after approval of such product in adult populations. While the FDA ultimately approved our request, if the FDA had required us to conduct pediatric studies in advance of FDA approval in adult populations, we would have experienced significant delays in our ability to obtain marketing approval for DEXTENZA for these indications. We will face a similar risk if we seek a comparable deferral for other product candidates or indications.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not favorable or are only modestly favorable or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u25cf be delayed in obtaining or unable to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u25cf obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u25cf obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;\n\u25cf be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u25cf have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether any of our preclinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of subjects in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates or other product candidates that we might develop if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible subjects to participate in these trials as required by the FDA, the EMA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Although there is a significant prevalence of disease in the areas of ophthalmology in which we are focused, we may nonetheless experience unanticipated difficulty with subject enrollment. For example, in the third quarter of 2017, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of OTX-TIC outside the United States. After several months, after not enrolling any subjects, we closed this trial in the second quarter of 2018. Additionally, we intended to initiate our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of OTX-TKI outside the United States in 2018, but delays in enrollment prevented us from dosing subjects until the first quarter of 2019.\nA variety of factors affect subject enrollment, including:\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of the ophthalmic disease or condition under investigation;\n\u25cf the eligibility criteria for the study in question;\n\u25cf the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u25cf the efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u25cf the patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u25cf the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment;\n\u25cf the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective subjects;\n\u25cf actual or threatened public health emergencies or outbreaks of disease (including, for example, the COVID-19 pandemic);\n\u25cf the conduct of clinical trials by competitors for product candidates that treat the same indications as our product candidates; and\n\u25cf the lack of adequate compensation for prospective subjects.\nDelays can be more pronounced with later-stage clinical trials because they tend to be larger than early-stage trials. For example, enrollment in our completed Phase 3 clinical trial of our former product candidate OTX-TP, the largest clinical trial we have conducted to date, was significantly slower than expected. It had a target enrollment of 550 subjects and was conducted at approximately 49 sites in the United States. Enrollment in our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate DEXTENZA in pediatric subjects following cataract surgery, to fulfill FDA post-approval regulatory requirements, is proceeding slowly due to the relative scarcity of pediatric cataract surgical subjects.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of subjects in any of our clinical trials would result in significant delays, could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether and could delay or prevent our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which could cause the value of our common stock to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nIf serious adverse or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of our product candidates or any other product candidates that we may develop, we may need to abandon or limit our development of such product candidates.\nIf any of our product candidates are associated with serious adverse events or undesirable side effects in clinical trials or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to\nmore narrow uses or subpopulations in which the serious adverse events, undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective.\nMany compounds that initially showed promise in clinical or early-stage testing for treating ophthalmic disease have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound. In addition, adverse events which had initially been considered unrelated to the study treatment may later be found to be caused by the study treatment.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to develop additional products and product candidates based on our bioresorbable hydrogel technology platform or expand the use of our bioresorbable hydrogel technology for treating additional diseases and conditions.\nWe are currently directing most of our development efforts towards applying our proprietary, bioresorbable hydrogel technology platform to products and product candidates that are designed to provide local programmed-release hydrogel-based therapeutic agents to the eye using active pharmaceutical ingredients that are currently used in FDA-approved ophthalmic drugs. In addition to DEXTENZA and ReSure Sealant, we have a number of product candidates at various stages of development based on our bioresorbable hydrogel technology platform and are exploring the potential use of our platform for other ophthalmic diseases and conditions. These product candidates include intracanalicular inserts eluting drug product to the ocular surface; hydrogel drug delivery implants designed to release therapeutic antibodies and small molecules such as TKIs to modulate the biological activity of VEGF over a sustained period following administration by an intravitreal injection for the treatment of diseases and conditions of the back of the eye, including wet AMD; and hydrogel drug delivery implants designed to release drug product into the anterior chamber of the eye via an intracameral injection for the treatment of diseases and conditions of the front of the eye.\nOur product candidates and any other product candidates that we may develop based on our platform may not be suitable for continued preclinical or clinical development, including as a result of being shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize products and product candidates that are based on our platform, we will not be able to obtain substantial product revenues in future periods.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates that we identify for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. In addition, if we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential of a target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nWe are currently prioritizing the continued commercialization of DEXTENZA, the advancement through Phase 1 clinical development of OTX-TKI for the treatment of wet AMD, and the advancement through Phase 2 clinical development of OTX-TIC for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and are assessing the further development of OTX-CSI for the chronic treatment of dry eye disease and OTX-DED for the short-term treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. Although we believe our prioritization of resources is currently the best use of our resources, we may not be correct.\nWe have conducted, and may in the future conduct, clinical trials for product candidates at sites outside the United States, and the FDA may not accept data from trials conducted in such locations.\nWe have conducted, and may in the future choose to conduct, one or more of our clinical trials outside the United States. We have often conducted our initial and earlier-stage clinical trials for our product candidates outside the United States. We are currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial for our product candidate OTX-TKI for the treatment of wet AMD in Australia. We generally plan to conduct our later stage and pivotal clinical trials of our product candidates in the United States.\nAlthough the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of this data is subject to conditions imposed by the FDA. For example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles. The trial population must also adequately represent the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful. In addition, while these clinical trials are subject to the applicable local laws, FDA acceptance of the data will depend on its determination that the trials also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. If the FDA does not accept the data from any trial that we conduct outside the United States, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and would delay or permanently halt our development of the applicable product candidates. Even if the FDA accepted such data, it could require us to modify our planned clinical trials to receive clearance to initiate such trials in the United States or to continue such trials once initiated.\nOther risks inherent in conducting international clinical trials include:\n\u25cf foreign regulatory requirements that could restrict or limit our ability to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u25cf administrative burdens of conducting clinical trials under multiple sets of foreign regulations;\n\u25cf failure of enrolled subjects to adhere to clinical protocols as a result of differences in healthcare services or cultural customs;\n\u25cf foreign exchange fluctuations;\n\u25cf diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries; and\n\u25cf political and economic risks relevant to foreign countries.\nRisks Related to Commercialization\nWe depend heavily on the success of DEXTENZA and any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. If we fail to commercialize these products successfully, our ability to generate significant product revenues and our business would be materially harmed.\nThe commercial success of DEXTENZA and any other product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will depend on many factors, including the following:\n\u25cf successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u25cf applying for and receiving and maintaining marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf scaling up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to support commercialization efforts;\n\u25cf developing, validating and maintaining a commercially viable manufacturing process that is compliant with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP;\n\u25cf developing our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and launching commercial sales of our products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u25cf partnering successfully with our current and future collaborators;\n\u25cf gaining acceptance of our products, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors, competing effectively with other therapies, and obtaining and maintaining coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors;\n\u25cf maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of our products following approval;\n\u25cf obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity; and\n\u25cf protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio.\nIn certain cases, such as in our collaboration with AffaMed and our prior collaboration with Regeneron, many of these factors may be or were beyond our control, including clinical development and sales, marketing and distribution efforts. If we or our collaborators do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates, which would materially harm our business.\nEven though DEXTENZA and ReSure Sealant have received marketing approval from the FDA and even if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, any of these products may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success, and the market opportunity for these products may be smaller than we estimate.\nDEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant or any of our product candidates that receives marketing approval may fail to gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. We commercially launched ReSure Sealant in the first quarter of 2014, DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain in July 2019, and are commercially launching DEXTENZA for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis in the first quarter of 2022, and we cannot yet accurately predict the extent to which these products will gain market acceptance and become commercially successful, if at all. We previously commenced commercialization in Europe of an earlier version of ReSure Sealant that was approved and marketed as an ocular bandage, but we were unsuccessful and ceased commercialization efforts of the product. If our products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and we may not become profitable.\nThe degree of market acceptance of DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant, or any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf our ability to offer our products for sale at competitive prices, particularly in light of the lower cost of alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n\u25cf the convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments, including the intracanalicular insert retention rate for our intracanalicular insert products and product candidates;\n\u25cf the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u25cf the strength of our marketing and distribution support;\n\u25cf timing of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u25cf the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement and, for ReSure Sealant, the lack of separate reimbursement when used as part of a cataract surgery procedure;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any side effects; and\n\u25cf any restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications.\nFor example, because we have not conducted any clinical trials to date comparing the effectiveness of DEXTENZA directly to currently approved alternative treatments for post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery or allergic conjunctivitis, it is possible that the market acceptance of DEXTENZA could be less than if we had conducted such trials, and we may not be able to achieve the market share we anticipate.\nWe also expect DEXTENZA for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis to be priced at a premium to certain treatment alternatives. As a result, we believe that certain payors will \u201cstep-edit\u201d DEXTENZA for this indication, meaning that patients will be asked to try lower priced therapeutics before the payor may be willing to reimburse for the use of DEXTENZA.\nOur assessment of the potential market opportunity for DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant and our product candidates is based on industry and market data that we obtained from industry publications and research, surveys and studies conducted by third parties. Industry publications and third-party research, surveys and studies generally indicate that their information has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. While we believe these industry publications and third-party research, surveys and studies are reliable, we have not independently verified such data. If the actual market for DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant or any of our product candidates is smaller than we expect, our product revenue may be limited and it may be more difficult for us to achieve or maintain profitability.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we may not be successful in commercializing DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant, or any product candidates if and when they are approved.\nWe have limited experience in the sale, marketing and distribution of drug and device products. To achieve commercial success for DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant, and any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, we will need to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, either ourselves or through collaborations or other arrangements with third parties. We have built our own highly targeted, key account sales force for DEXTENZA that has focused primarily on ambulatory surgical centers, or ASCs, responsible for the largest volumes of cataract surgery.\nIn connection with our commercial launch of DEXTENZA for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis, we intend to launch a separate sales force focused on ophthalmologists\u2019 offices. We believe that certain other of our product candidates, if they are successfully developed and obtain marketing approval, would also be primarily used in the office setting. We believe the office setting offers a unique set of potential challenges. If we are unsuccessful in adapting our marketing efforts to include the office setting, our ability to commercialize DEXTENZA to its fullest potential or any future product candidates used in the office setting would be adversely affected.\nBecause we have not historically evaluated whether to seek regulatory approval for any of our products or product candidates outside of the United States, pending potential receipt of regulatory approval for the applicable product candidate in the United States, at this time we cannot be certain when, if ever, we will recognize revenue from commercialization of our products or product candidates in any international markets. If we decide to commercialize our products outside of the United States, we expect to utilize a variety of types of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties to commercialize any product of ours that receives marketing approval. These may include independent distributors, pharmaceutical companies or our own direct sales organization. For example, we intend to rely on AffaMed to commercialize DEXTENZA and OTX-TIC, if approved for marketing, in specified jurisdictions in Asia in connection with our collaboration agreement with AffaMed.\nThere are risks involved with both establishing our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and with entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. We may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute our products or may be unable to do so on terms that are most beneficial to us. Such third parties may have interests that differ from ours. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to market, sell and distribute our products effectively. Our product revenues and our profitability, if any, under third-party collaboration, distribution or other marketing arrangements may also be lower than if we were to sell, market and distribute a product ourselves. On the other hand, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of any product or product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nOther factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize products on our own include:\n\u25cf our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or lack of adequate number of physicians to use or prescribe our products;\n\u25cf the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u25cf unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we do not establish and maintain sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant or any of our product candidates.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug and device products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our products and product candidates, and will face competition with respect to any other product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.\nOur products and product candidates target markets that are already served by a variety of competing products based on a number of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Many of these existing products have achieved widespread acceptance among physicians, patients and payors for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases and conditions. In addition, many of these products are available on a generic basis, and our products and product candidates may not demonstrate sufficient additional clinical benefits to physicians, patients or payors to justify a higher price compared to generic products. In many cases, insurers or other third-party payors, particularly Medicare, encourage the use of generic products. Given that we are primarily developing products based on FDA-approved therapeutic agents, our products and product candidates, if approved, will face competition from generic and branded versions of existing drugs based on the same active pharmaceutical ingredients that are administered in a different manner, typically through eye drops or intravitreal injections.\nBecause the active pharmaceutical ingredients in our products and product candidates are primarily available on a generic basis, or are soon to be available on a generic basis, competitors will be able to offer and sell products with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as our products so long as these competitors do not infringe the patents that we license or own. For example, our licensed patents related to our intracanalicular insert products and product candidates largely relate to the hydrogel composition of the intracanalicular inserts and certain drug-release features of the inserts. As such, if a third party were able to design around the formulation and process patents that we license or own and create a different formulation using a different production process not covered by our licensed patents or patent applications, we would likely be unable to prevent that third party from manufacturing and marketing its product.\nIcon Biosciences, Inc. received FDA approval of DEXYCU in February 2018. DEXYCU is an injection of dexamethasone into the anterior chamber of the eye to treat inflammation associated with cataract surgery. Other companies have also advanced into Phase 3 clinical development biodegradable, programmed-release drug delivery product candidates that could compete with our intracanalicular insert products and product candidates. ReSure Sealant is the first and only surgical sealant approved as a device for ophthalmic use in the United States, but it competes with sutures as an alternative method for closing ophthalmic wounds. Multiple companies are exploring in early-stage development alternative means to deliver anti-VEGF and TKI products in an extended-delivery fashion to the back of the eye. There are also multiple branded, generic and over-the-counter products, in the dry eye space, including Restasis\u00ae, for increasing tear production, marketed by Allergan; Cequa\u2122 for increasing tear production, marketed by\nSun Ophthalmics in the United States; lifitegrast, for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, marketed by Novartis under the brand name Xiidra\u00ae; and off-label use of corticosteroids.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, are less expensive than our products or have better reimbursement. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nMany of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, manufacturing, marketing, and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nDEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant and any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party coverage or reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could harm our business.\nOur ability to commercialize DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant or any product candidates that we may develop successfully will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government healthcare programs, private health insurers, managed care plans and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug and device companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Coverage and reimbursement may not be available for DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant or any other product that we commercialize and, even if they are available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory.\nInadequate reimbursement may adversely affect the demand for, or the price of, DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant or any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Obtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement for our products may be difficult. We may be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to justify coverage and reimbursement or the level of reimbursement relative to other therapies. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant or any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs and devices, and coverage may be more limited than the indications for which the drug is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any FDA-approved products that we develop would compromise our ability to generate revenues and become profitable.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug and device products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product or product candidate to other available therapies. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more products or product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nDEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant or any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval in the United States or in other countries may not be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, may not be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, coverage and an adequate level of reimbursement may not be available, and reimbursement policies of third-party payors may adversely affect our ability to sell our products and product candidates profitably. ReSure Sealant is not separately reimbursed when used as part of a cataract surgery procedure, which limits the degree of market acceptance of this product by surgeons. DEXTENZA is currently considered a post-surgical product, in the same fashion as eye drops. However, if DEXTENZA were instead categorized as an intra-operative product, it would not be subject to separate reimbursement in ASCs and hospital out-patient departments, or HOPDs, which could likewise limit its market acceptance.\nA specific and permanent J-Code for ophthalmic inserts containing dexamethasone including DEXTENZA is in effect, and DEXTENZA currently benefits from transitional pass-through status. However, DEXTENZA is scheduled to lose transitional pass-through status in July 2022. In November 2021, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, in its annual rulemaking, indicated that DEXTENZA will be paid separately in the ASC and HOPD settings through 2022 despite its scheduled loss of pass-through status. CMS also indicated that DEXTENZA is eligible for separate payment in the ASC setting beyond 2022 because it meets the criteria set forth for non-opioid pain management drugs as a surgical supply provision. There can be no assurance that CMS will not change the criteria applicable to non-opioid pain management drugs for 2023 or beyond. If DEXTENZA is no longer eligible for reimbursement separately from ophthalmic surgery, due to the loss of pass-through status or otherwise, our net product revenues, which currently consist primarily of DEXTENZA sales in reliance on separate reimbursement through pass-through status, would decline significantly, and our ability to generate revenues from future sales of DEXTENZA to ASCs and HOPDs for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, CMS, during the same rulemaking cycle, made a final recommendation on the fixed reimbursement amount for Category I Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, code 68841, the procedure code for the insertion of DEXTENZA, effective January 1, 2022. As this new fee schedule is lower than reimbursement many physicians received under the prior Category III CPT code for DEXTENZA, physicians may have less incentive to use DEXTENZA and, as a result, our ability to continue to commercialize DEXTENZA may decrease. Additionally, although CMS established these reimbursement amounts for 2022, CMS will review such determination as part of its annual rulemaking cycle, and such amount could be further reduced in the future. Physicians\u2019 desire to use DEXTENZA could also be adversely impacted if competitive products secure higher procedure payments for their use than DEXTENZA, negatively impacting our ability to continue to commercialize DEXTENZA.\nThere are no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining reimbursement for DEXTENZA or of obtaining or maintaining reimbursement for any products or product candidates for which we might receive marketing approval in the future.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the use of our product candidates that we develop in human clinical trials. We face an even greater risk for any products we develop and commercially sell, including DEXTENZA and ReSure Sealant. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we develop;\n\u25cf injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to trial participants or subjects;\n\u25cf loss of revenue;\n\u25cf reduced time and attention of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize any products that we develop.\nWe currently hold $10.0 million in U.S. product liability insurance coverage in the aggregate, with a per incident limit of $10.0 million and approximately $15.0 million in product liability insurance in another jurisdiction in which we operate, with a per incident liability limit of approximately $15.0 million. These policies may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur and we may need to increase our insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials and our sales of DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant and any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nRisks Related to Manufacturing\nIf our sole clinical and commercial manufacturing facility is damaged or destroyed or production at this facility is otherwise interrupted, our business and prospects would be negatively affected.\nIf our single-site manufacturing facility or the equipment in it is damaged or destroyed, we may not be able to quickly or inexpensively replace our manufacturing capacity or replace it at all. In the event of a temporary or protracted loss of this facility or equipment, we might not be able to transfer manufacturing to another facility or to a third party. Even if we could transfer our manufacturing to another facility or a third party, the shift would likely be expensive and time-consuming, particularly since any new facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements and to be inspected and qualified. We would also need FDA approval before any products manufactured at that facility could be used for commercial supply. In the case of any disruption in our manufacturing operations at this facility, we may not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet our clinical trial requirements or of our product inventory to meet our commercial requirements. Such an event could delay our clinical trials or, particularly because we have sought to adopt just-in-time manufacturing practices and maintain limited commercial product inventory with our distributors, reduce our product sales.\nCurrently, we maintain insurance coverage against damage to our property and equipment in the amount of up to $27.8 million and to cover business interruption and research and development restoration expenses in the amount of up to $15.8 million. However, our insurance coverage may not reimburse us, or may not be sufficient to reimburse us, for any expenses or losses we may suffer. We may be unable to meet our requirements for DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant, or any of our product candidates if there were a catastrophic event or failure of our current manufacturing facility or processes.\nWe will need to upgrade and expand our manufacturing facility or relocate to another facility and to augment our manufacturing personnel and processes in order to meet our business plans. If we fail to do so, we may not have sufficient quantities of our products or product candidates to meet our commercial and clinical trial requirements.\nWe manufacture DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant and our product candidates for use in clinical trials, research and development and commercial efforts at our single-site clinical and commercial manufacturing facility located in Bedford, Massachusetts. In order to meet our business plan, which contemplates our scaling up manufacturing processes to support the commercialization of our current products and the development and potential commercialization of our current and future product candidates, we will need to upgrade and expand our existing manufacturing facility, or relocate to another manufacturing facility; add manufacturing, quality and support personnel; ensure that new processes, systems, and facilities are qualified and validated; and ensure that any new processes and systems are consistently implemented in our facility or facilities. The upgrade and expansion of our facility, or the relocation to an additional facility, will require additional regulatory approvals including FDA audits of such new processes, systems, and facilities. In addition, it will be costly and time-consuming to expand our facility or relocate to another facility and recruit necessary additional personnel. If we are unable to expand our manufacturing facility or relocate to another facility in compliance with regulatory requirements or to hire additional necessary manufacturing personnel, we may encounter delays or additional costs in achieving our research, development and commercialization objectives, including obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidates and meeting customer demand for our products, which could materially damage our business and financial position. For example, we are not currently manufacturing ReSure Sealant in order to focus our manufacturing resources on supporting the commercialization of DEXTENZA.\nWe must comply with federal, state and foreign regulations, including quality standards applicable to medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers, such as cGMP, which are enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program and by similar regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions where we do business. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality systems and the maintenance of records and documentation. For example, between March 2015 and May 2018, we received multiple Form 483s from the FDA containing inspectional observations relating to inadequate procedures for documenting follow-up information pertinent to the investigation of complaints and for evaluation of complaints for adverse event reporting; process controls, analytical testing and physical security procedures related to manufacture of our drug product for stability and commercial production purposes; and procedures for manufacturing processes and analytical testing related to the manufacture of drug product for commercial production. In each of July 2016 and July 2017, we also received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA regarding our NDA for DEXTENZA pertaining to, among other things, the deficiencies in manufacturing processes, controls, and analytical testing identified during pre-NDA approval inspections of our manufacturing facility documented on Form 483s. We may be subject to similar inspections and requirements in connection with subsequent applications for other product candidates or DEXTENZA or in connection with periodic, routine inspections for products for which we have received marketing authorization.\nAs our facility is an approved pharmaceutical and medical device commercial manufacturing location, we are subject to routine inspections and system audits in connection with, among other things, our Safety, Identity, Strength, Purity, and Quality, or SISPQ; our process controls; and our standard operating procedures. If we fail to respond or comply in a satisfactory manner with any directives or observations that we may receive from the FDA as a result of inspections or informational requests, the FDA may take regulatory or other actions that would adversely impact our ability to continue manufacturing our commercial products and clinical or preclinical product candidates or to otherwise hinder or delay the clinical development and commercialization of our products and product candidates. In January and February 2021, the FDA requested information and records from us relating to our DEXTENZA commercial manufacturing operations and quality systems pursuant to Form 4003 in advance or in lieu of a drug inspection. In early March 2021, the FDA provided confirmation of receipt of the records that had been requested from us.\nThe FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities at any time also may implement new standards, or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards, for the manufacture, packaging or testing of our products. Any failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, product seizure or recall, imposition of a consent decree, or withdrawal of product approval, and would limit the availability of DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant and our product candidates that we manufacture.\nAny manufacturing defect, failure against SISPQ, or error discovered after products have been produced and distributed could result in significant consequences, including costly recall procedures, re-stocking costs, damage to our reputation and potential for product liability claims.\nWe expect to continue to contract with third parties for at least some aspects of the production of our products and product candidates. We also depend from time to time on single-source suppliers for certain materials used in the manufacturing of our products and product candidates. This increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our products or product candidates or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe currently rely on third parties for some aspects of the production of DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant and our product candidates for commercialization and preclinical testing and clinical trials. While we expect that our existing manufacturing facility, or additional facilities that we might be able to build, will be sufficient to meet our requirements for manufacturing DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant and any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, we may in the future need to rely on third-party manufacturers for some aspects of the manufacture of our products or product candidates.\nWe also depend on single-source suppliers for certain materials used in the manufacturing of our products and product candidates, including our supply of PEG, the molecule that forms the basis of our hydrogels, and other raw materials of DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant and our product candidates and for sterilization of the finished product. We do not have any long-term supply agreements in place for the clinical or commercial supply of any drug substances or raw materials for DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant or any of our product candidates. We purchase drug substance and raw materials, including the chemical constituents for our hydrogel, from independent suppliers on a purchase order basis. We cannot ensure that our suppliers will remain in business, have sufficient capacity or supply to meet our needs or that they will not be purchased by one of our competitors or another company that is not interested in continuing to work with us. Our use of single-source suppliers of raw materials and other components used in the manufacturing of our products and product candidates could expose us to several risks, including disruptions in supply, price increases or late deliveries. Any performance failure or refusal to supply drug substance or raw materials on the part of our existing or future suppliers could delay clinical development, marketing approval or commercialization of our products. If our current suppliers do not perform as we expect, we may be required to replace one or more of these suppliers. Establishing additional or replacement suppliers could take a substantial amount of time, and it may be difficult to establish replacement suppliers who meet our quality standards and applicable regulatory requirements. For example, we depend on a sole source supplier for the supply of our PEG. This sole source supplier may be unwilling or unable to supply PEG to us reliably, continuously and at the levels we anticipate or are required by the market. Although we believe that there are a number of potential long-term replacements to our suppliers, including our PEG supplier, we may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacements.\nReliance on third parties for aspects of the supply of our products and product candidates entails additional risks, including:\n\u25cf reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u25cf the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how;\n\u25cf the possible breach of an agreement by the third party; and\n\u25cf the possible termination or nonrenewal of an agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nThird-party suppliers or manufacturers may not be able to comply with our specifications, quality assurance standards, cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third parties, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products and product candidates.\nOur potential future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our products and product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe have entered into collaborations with third parties to develop certain product candidates, and in the future we may enter into additional collaborations for the development or commercialization of our product candidates. We may also enter into collaboration, distribution or marketing arrangements for the commercialization of DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant, or any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval outside of the United States. If our collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these products or product candidates.\nWe have in the past entered into collaboration agreements with third parties, including our collaborations with AffaMed and with our former collaborator, Regeneron, and expect to utilize a variety of types of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties to commercialize DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant, or any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval in markets outside the United States. We also may enter into arrangements with third parties to perform these services in the United States if we do not establish our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities in the United States for such products or if we determine that such third-party arrangements are otherwise beneficial. We also may seek additional third-party collaborators for development and commercialization of product candidates. Our likely collaborators for any sales, marketing, distribution, development, licensing or broader collaboration arrangements include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nOur collaboration with AffaMed poses, and any future collaborations likely will pose, a number of risks including the following:\n\u25cf collaborators have significant discretion in determining the amount and timing of efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u25cf collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u25cf collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our products or product candidates that receive marketing approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on results of clinical trials or other studies, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u25cf collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u25cf collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u25cf product candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u25cf a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u25cf disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of products or product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with\nrespect to products or product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would divert management attention and resources, be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u25cf collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u25cf collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and\n\u25cf collaborations may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable products or product candidates.\nCollaboration agreements may not lead to the development or commercialization of products or product candidates in the most efficient manner, or at all. If any collaborations that we enter into do not result in the successful development and commercialization of products or if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. If we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements, our development of our products or product candidates could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop our products or product candidates. For example, our former collaborator Regeneron terminated our collaboration in August 2021. As a result of the termination, we were relieved of obligations to reimburse Regeneron for certain development costs, up to an aggregate amount of $30.0 million in certain circumstances, were Regeneron to exercise its option but also ceased to be eligible to receive (i) reimbursement from Regeneron for ongoing research and development activities, (ii) a fee upon exercise of its option, (iii) payments upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones of the products developed under the collaboration, or (iv) tiered, escalating royalties on such products. All of the risks relating to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization described in this periodic report also apply to the activities of our collaborators.\nAdditionally, if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators and our perception in the business and financial communities could be harmed.\nIf we are not able to establish additional collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans and our business could be adversely affected.\nFor some of our other product candidates, we may decide to collaborate with pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies for the development and potential commercialization of those product candidates. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to subjects, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. We may also be restricted under current or future license and collaboration agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate, document, and operate under. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators.\nIf we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we will need to\nobtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market or continue to develop our product platform.\nAlthough the majority of our clinical development is administered and managed by our own employees, we have relied, and may continue to rely, on third parties for certain aspects of our clinical development, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.\nOur employees have administered and managed most of our clinical development work, including our clinical trials for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery. However, we have relied on third parties, such as CROs, to conduct clinical trials of certain of our product candidates, including OTX-TKI for the treatment of wet AMD and OTX-TIC for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, and we may continue to do so. If we deem necessary, we may engage additional third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct or assist in our clinical trials or other clinical development work. If we are unable to enter into an agreement with a CRO or other service provider when required, our product development activities would be delayed.\nOur reliance on third parties for research and development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. For example, in May 2020, we disclosed the receipt of interim data regarding our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of OTX-TKI, in Australia, for the potential treatment of wet AMD and other retinal diseases. In July 2020, however, we received further, and partially contradictory, information from the clinical trial site where certain subjects were being treated. As the clinical trial site had not entered certain data concerning these subjects into the clinical trial database in a timely manner, complete information was not available to or known by us at the time of our prior disclosures. We are also required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. If we engage third parties and they do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may be unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or the scope of the patent protection obtained may not be sufficiently broad, such that our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.\nOur success depends in large part on our and our licensor\u2019s ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We and our licensor have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies, products and product candidates. Some of our licensed patents that we believe are integral to our hydrogel technology platform have terms that extend through at least 2024. However, other broader patents within our patent portfolio have already expired. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting our candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio would be less effective in excluding others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not have filed or prosecuted and may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection.\nIn some circumstances, we do not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to enforce or maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties. In particular, the license agreement that we have entered into with Incept LLC, or Incept, an intellectual property holding company, which covers a significant portion of the patent rights and the technology for DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant and our product candidates, provides that, with limited exceptions, Incept has sole control and responsibility for ongoing prosecution for certain patents covered by the license agreement. In addition, although we have a right under the Incept license to bring suit against third parties who infringe such licensed patents in our fields, other Incept licensees may also have the right to enforce these patents in their own respective fields without our oversight or control. Those other licensees may choose to enforce our licensed patents in a way that harms our interest, for example, by advocating for claim interpretations or agreeing on invalidity positions that conflict with our positions or our interest. For example, three of our licensed patents related to ReSure Sealant were invalidated and rendered unenforceable following their assertion by Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation, another licensee of Incept. We also have no right to control the defense of such licensed patents if their validity or scope is challenged before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, European Patent Office, or other patent office or tribunal. Instead, we would essentially rely on our licensor to defend such challenges, and it may not do so in a way that would best protect our interests. Therefore, certain of our licensed patents and applications may not be prosecuted, enforced, defended or maintained in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If Incept fails to prosecute, enforce or maintain such patents, or loses rights to those patents, our licensed patent portfolio may be reduced or eliminated.\nThe patent position of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights, including our licensed patent rights, are highly uncertain. Our and our licensor\u2019s pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, unlike patent law in the United States, European patent law precludes the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body and imposes substantial restrictions on the scope of claims it will grant if broader than specifically disclosed embodiments. We have only three issued patents outside of the United States that cover all three intracanalicular insert products and product candidates. We have three licensed patent families in Europe and certain other parts of the world for our intravitreal drug delivery product candidates, but only one patent issuance to date outside of the United States. Patents might not be issued and we may never obtain any patent protection or may only obtain substantially limited patent protection outside of the United States with respect to our products.\nPublications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or our licensor were the first to make the inventions claimed in our licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Databases for patents and publications, and methods for searching them, are inherently limited so it is not practical to review and know the full scope of all issued and pending patent applications. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our licensed patent rights are uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. In particular, during prosecution of any patent application, the issuance of any patents based on the application may depend upon our ability to generate additional preclinical or clinical data that support the patentability of our proposed claims. We may not be able to generate sufficient additional data on a timely basis, or at all. Moreover, changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nPatent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013. The first to file provisions limit the rights of an inventor to patent an invention if not the first to file an application for patenting that invention, even if such invention was the first invention. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its\nimplementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. For example, the Leahy-Smith Act provides an administrative tribunal known as the Patent Trial and Appeals Board, or PTAB, that provides a venue for companies to challenge the validity of competitor patents at a cost that is much lower than district court litigation and on timelines that are much faster. Although it is not clear what, if any, long term impact the PTAB proceedings will have on the operation of our business, the initial results of patent challenge proceedings before the PTAB since its inception in 2013 have resulted in the invalidation of many U.S. patent claims. The availability of the PTAB as a lower-cost, faster and potentially more potent tribunal for challenging patents could therefore increase the likelihood that our own licensed patents will be challenged, thereby increasing the uncertainties and costs of maintaining and enforcing them. Moreover, if such challenges occur, as indicated above, we have no right to control the defense. Instead, we would essentially rely on our licensor to consider our suggestions and to defend such challenges, with the possibility that it may not do so in a way that best protects our interests.\nWe may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, or become involved in other contested proceedings such as opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future products.\nIn the United States, the FDA does not prohibit physicians from prescribing an approved product for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling. Although use of a product directed by off-label prescriptions may infringe our method-of-treatment patents, the practice is common across medical specialties, particularly in the United States, and such infringement is difficult to detect, prevent or prosecute. In addition, patents that cover methods of use for a medical device cannot be enforced against the party that uses the device, but rather only against the party that makes them. Such indirect enforcement is more difficult to achieve.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nBecause the active pharmaceutical ingredients in our products and product candidates are primarily available on a generic basis, or are soon to be available on a generic basis, competitors will be able to offer and sell products with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as our products so long as these competitors do not infringe our patents or any patents that we license. These patents largely relate to the hydrogel composition of our intracanalicular inserts and the drug-release design scheme of our inserts. As such, if a third party were able to design around the formulation and process patents that we license and create a different formulation using a different production process not covered by our patents or patent applications, we would likely be unable to prevent that third party from manufacturing and marketing its product.\nIf we are not able to obtain patent term extensions in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act and in foreign countries under similar legislation, thereby potentially extending the term of our marketing exclusivity for our product and product candidates, our business may be impaired.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one of the U.S. patents covering each of such product candidates or the use thereof may be eligible for up to five years of patent term restoration under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows a maximum of one patent to be extended per FDA-approved product. Patent term extension also may be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval of our product candidates. Nevertheless, we may not be granted patent term extension either in the United States or in any foreign country because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to\napply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the term of extension, as well as the scope of patent protection during any such extension, afforded by the governmental authority could be less than we request.\nFurther, our license from Incept does not provide us with the right to control decisions by Incept or its other licensees on Orange Book listings or patent term extension decisions under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Thus, if one of our important licensed patents is eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, and it covers a product of another Incept licensee in addition to our own product candidate, we may not be able to obtain that extension if the other licensee seeks and obtains that extension first.\nIf we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration, or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our product may be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration sooner, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our licensed patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our licensed patents or other intellectual property. As a result, to counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Under the terms of our license agreement with Incept, we have the right to initiate suit against third parties who we believe infringe on the patents subject to the license. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent we have rights to is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products and product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology, medical device, and pharmaceutical industries. We may become party to, or threatened with, infringement litigation claims regarding our products and technology, including claims from competitors or from non-practicing entities that have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may have no deterrent effect. Moreover, we may become party to future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding our patent portfolio or the patents of third parties. Such proceedings could also include contested post-grant proceedings such as oppositions, inter partes review, reexamination, interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO or foreign patent offices. The legal threshold for initiating litigation or contested proceedings is low, so that even lawsuits or proceedings with a low probability of success might be initiated and require significant resources to defend. Litigation and contested proceedings can also be expensive and time-consuming, and our adversaries in these proceedings may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we or our licensor can. The risks of being involved in such litigation and proceedings may increase as our products or product candidates near commercialization and as we gain the greater visibility associated with being a public company. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may acquire or be granted in the future. We may not be aware of all such intellectual property rights potentially relating to our products or product candidates and their uses, or we may incorrectly determine that a patent is invalid or does not cover a particular product or product candidate. Thus, we do not know with certainty that DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant or any of our product candidates, or our commercialization thereof, does not and will not infringe or otherwise violate any third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nWe have been made aware by a third party of patents relating to intracanalicular inserts that may relate to, and potentially could be asserted against, our intracanalicular insert product and product candidates, including DEXTENZA. We believe that DEXTENZA does not infringe any claims of these patents. We also believe that such claims, if and to\nthe extent they were asserted against our product candidates, would be subject to claims of invalidity. We initiated legal proceedings against one of these patents and administrative proceedings against the other two patents in order to show that DEXTENZA does not infringe the claims of these patents or that these patents are invalid. Legal proceedings related to one of these patents has been dismissed by agreement of the parties without prejudice. The USPTO decided to proceed with the administrative proceeding related to one of the patents while declining to do so for the other after determining that we had not established a reasonable likelihood that we would prevail in establishing the unpatentability of certain claims. In June 2020, for the patent for which the USPTO decided to proceed with administrative proceedings, the PTAB, after an inter partes review, determined that we had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that all claims of the patent at issue held by such third party were invalid. The third party appealed this decision, and in November 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the holding of the PTAB. The period during which such third party may appeal the decision of the Court of Appeals has lapsed. We continue to believe that DEXTENZA does not infringe the claims of these patents and that, if and to the extent it were asserted against DEXTENZA, such patent would be subject to a claim of invalidity. We have become aware that the USPTO has recently issued a patent filed by this third party related to intracanalicular inserts containing dexamethasone. If this patent were asserted against DEXTENZA or other of our product candidates, we believe such patent would be non-infringed and subject to a claim of invalidity.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, such as the patents referred to in the preceding paragraph, we could be required to obtain a royalty-bearing license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product including our intracanalicular insert product and product candidates. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent and could be forced to indemnify our customers or collaborators. A finding of infringement could also result in an injunction that prevents us from commercializing our products or product candidates or forces us to cease some of our business operations. In addition, we may be forced to redesign our products or product candidates, seek new regulatory approvals thereby causing delays, and indemnify third parties pursuant to contractual agreements. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses and funding arrangements with third parties, we could lose rights that are important to our business.\nOur license agreement with Incept, under which we license a significant portion of our patent rights and the technology for DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant and our product candidates, imposes royalty and other financial obligations and other substantial performance obligations on us. We also may enter into additional licensing and funding arrangements with third parties that may impose diligence, development and commercialization timelines and milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with our obligations under current or future license and collaboration agreements, our counterparties may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we might not be able to develop, manufacture or market any product that is covered by these agreements or may face other penalties under the agreements. Such an occurrence could diminish the value of our product. Termination of these agreements or reduction or elimination of our rights under these agreements may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated agreements with less favorable terms, or cause us to lose our rights under these agreements, including our rights to important intellectual property or technology.\nUnder the terms of our license agreement with Incept, we have agreed to assign to Incept our rights in certain patent applications filed at any time in any country for which one or more inventors are under an obligation of assignment to us. These assigned patent applications and any resulting patents are included within the specified patents owned or controlled by Incept to which we receive a license under the agreement. Incept has retained rights to practice the patents and technology licensed to us under the agreement for all purposes other than for researching, designing, developing, manufacturing and commercializing products that are delivered to or around the human eye for diagnostic, therapeutic or prophylactic purposes relating to ophthalmic diseases or conditions. As a result, termination of our agreement with Incept, based on our failure to comply with this or any other obligation under the agreement, would cause us to lose a significant portion of our rights to important intellectual property or technology upon which our business depends. Additionally, the field limit of the license and the requirement that we assign to Incept our rights in certain patent applications may restrict our ability to use certain of our licensed rights to expand our business outside of\nthe specified fields. If we determine to pursue a strategy of expanding the use of the hydrogel technology outside of the specified fields, we would need to negotiate and enter into an amendment to our existing license agreement with Incept or a new license agreement with Incept covering one or more additional such fields of use or utilize technologies that do not infringe on such licensed rights. We may not be able to obtain any such required amendment or new license or to invent or otherwise access other technology on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology, medical device or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for our technology, products and product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval and Marketing of Our Product Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nEven if we complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials, the regulatory approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates. If we or any current or future collaborator of ours is not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we or they will not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nThe activities associated with the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates, including design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and by the EMA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We have only received approval to market DEXTENZA and ReSure Sealant in the United States, and have not received approval to market any of our product candidates or to market DEXTENZA or ReSure Sealant in any jurisdiction outside the United States. Further, we have only received approval to market DEXTENZA for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery and ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis and have not received approval to market DEXTENZA for any other indications. We may determine to seek a CE Certificate of Conformity, which demonstrates compliance with relevant requirements and provides approval to commercialize ReSure Sealant in the European Union. If we are unable to obtain a CE Certificate of Conformity for DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant, or any of our product candidates for which we seek European regulatory approval, we will be prohibited from commercializing such product or products in the European Union and other places which require the CE Certificate of Conformity. In such a case, the potential market to commercialize our products may be significantly smaller than we currently estimate.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive and may take many years, especially if additional clinical trials are required, if approval is obtained at all. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and purity. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. The FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities may determine that our product candidates are not safe or effective, are only moderately effective or have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nAs part of its review of the NDA for DEXTENZA for post-surgical ocular pain, the FDA completed inspections of three sites from our two completed Phase 3 clinical trials for compliance with the study protocol and Good Clinical Practices. During the first of these inspections, the FDA identified storage temperature excursions for the investigational product that is labeled to be stored in a refrigerated condition between two degrees and eight degrees Celsius. We also had previously addressed a minor temperature deviation report during the conduct of the Phase 3 trials and communicated a response to the trial sites. In addition, while investigating the report stemming from the FDA inspection, several more noteworthy temperature excursions were found to have occurred that had not been fully reported.\nThe FDA also completed two inspections of our manufacturing facility in connection with our NDA for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain. After each inspection, we received a Form 483 from the FDA pertaining to deficiencies in our manufacturing processes identified during such inspection. After we responded to the issues which had been identified with corrective action plans, we subsequently received CRLs from the FDA. We may be subject to similar inspections in the future for DEXTENZA or for other product candidates for which we seek FDA approval. For example, in February 2021, the FDA requested information and records from us relating to our DEXTENZA commercial manufacturing operations and quality systems pursuant to Form 4003 in advance or in lieu of a drug inspection. If we are unable to address any identified issues successfully or if the FDA determines that the actions we take to remediate any identified issues to be inadequate, our ability to commercialize any products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nChanges in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the\napproval or rejection of an application. The FDA, the EMA and regulatory authorities in other countries have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we or any current or future collaborator of ours ultimately obtains may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nFinally, disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may prolong the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory authorities, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAccordingly, if we or any current or future collaborator of ours experiences delays in obtaining approval or if we or they fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired.\nEven if we, or any current or future collaborators, obtain marketing approvals for our product candidates, the terms of approvals, ongoing regulations and post-marketing restrictions for our products may limit how we manufacture and market our products, which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nOnce marketing approval has been granted, an approved product and its manufacturer and marketer are subject to ongoing review and extensive regulation. We, and any current or future collaborators, must therefore comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any of our products for which we or our collaborators obtain marketing approval. Promotional communications with respect to drug products, biologics, and medical devices are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved labeling. Thus, if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved use of our product, which could limit sales of the product.\nThe FDA required two post-approval studies as a condition for approval of our premarket approval application for ReSure Sealant. The first post-approval study, identified as the Clinical PAS, was to enroll at least 598 subjects to confirm that ReSure Sealant can be used safely by physicians in a standard cataract surgery practice and to confirm the incidence of the most prevalent adverse ocular events identified in our pivotal study of ReSure Sealant in eyes treated with ReSure Sealant. We submitted the final study report of the Clinical PAS to the FDA in June 2016. The second post-approval study, identified as the Device Exposure Registry, or DER, Study, was intended to link to the Medicare database to ascertain if subjects are diagnosed or treated for endophthalmitis within 30 days following cataract surgery and application of ReSure Sealant. The originally approved DER Study was required to include at least 4,857 subjects. Due to difficulties in establishing an acceptable way to link ReSure Sealant to the Medicare database and lack of investigator interest, we were unable to enroll trial sites and subjects, collect subject data and report study data to the FDA. On October 18, 2018, we received a warning letter from the FDA, dated October 17, 2018, relating to our compliance with data collection and information reporting obligations in this study. A teleconference was held with the FDA in January 2019 resulting in tentative agreement on a proposed retrospective registry study of endophthalmitis rates to satisfy the DER Study requirements. In December 2019, we submitted the protocol for the agreed-upon retrospective study and the prospective study outline, as required per the terms of the warning letter. In May 2020, the FDA approved the protocol. We completed the retrospective study in accordance with our agreement with the FDA and submitted the final study report for the DER Study to the FDA in January 2021. In April 2021, the FDA confirmed that the DER Study had been completed and that we had fulfilled our post-approval study requirements.\nThe FDA is also requiring us to conduct clinical trials of DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain and for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis in pediatric populations. These are post-approval requirements in accordance with the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003.\nIn addition, manufacturers of approved products and those manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMPs applicable to drug and biologic manufacturers or quality assurance standards applicable to medical device manufacturers, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding\nmaintenance of records and documentation and reporting requirements. We, any contract manufacturers we may engage in the future, our current or future collaborators and their contract manufacturers will also be subject to other regulatory requirements, including submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians, recordkeeping, and costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product such as the requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy.\nAccordingly, in connection with our currently approved products and assuming we, or any current or future collaborators, receive marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, we, and any current or future collaborators, and our and their contract manufacturers will continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and quality control. If we, and any current or future collaborators, are not able to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, we, and any current or future collaborators, could have the marketing approvals for our products withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our, or any current or future collaborators\u2019, ability to market any products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability. Further, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to substantial penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control and manufacturing, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, and requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. In addition, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the medicine, including the requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. Accordingly, if we receive marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, we will continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and quality control. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could have the marketing approvals for our products withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our ability to market any products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe must also comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Promotional communications with respect to prescription products are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved labeling. Thus, we will not be able to promote any products we develop for indications or uses for which they are not approved. The FDA and other agencies, including the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure that they are marketed and distributed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. In September 2021, the FDA published final regulations which describe the types of evidence that the agency will consider in determining the intended use of a drug or biologic. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA Act, and other statutes, including the False Claims Act, relating to the promotion and advertising of prescription products may lead to investigations and enforcement actions alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:\n\u25cf restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u25cf restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u25cf restrictions on product distribution or use of a product;\n\u25cf requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u25cf withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u25cf refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u25cf recall of products;\n\u25cf fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u25cf suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u25cf refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u25cf product seizure or detention;\n\u25cf injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;\n\u25cf damage to relationships with any potential collaborators;\n\u25cf unfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation; or\n\u25cf litigation involving patients using our products.\nSimilar restrictions apply to the approval of our products in the European Union. The holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products.\nOur relationships with healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which, in the event of a violation, could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription and use of DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant and any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u25cf the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation or arranging of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u25cf the federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government, with potential liability including mandatory treble damages and significant per-claim penalties;\n\u25cf the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u25cf HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u25cf the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered products to report payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals; and\n\u25cf analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and transparency statutes, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.\nSome state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require product manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf our operations or the operations of our present and future collaborators are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any governmental regulations that apply to us or them, we or they may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our or their financial results. We are developing and implementing a corporate compliance program designed to ensure that we will market and sell any future products that we successfully develop from our product candidates in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, but we cannot guarantee that this program will protect us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nEfforts to ensure that our business with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. For example, we are engaged in an ongoing effort to improve our healthcare compliance program and establish a more robust compliance infrastructure. We may fail to establish appropriate compliance measures, and even with a stronger program in place, it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nThe provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in other jurisdictions. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union Member States and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. Payments made to physicians in certain European Union Member States must be publicly disclosed and often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician\u2019s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual European Union Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.\nCurrent and future legislation or executive actions may increase the difficulty and cost for us and any current or future collaborators to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our products or product candidates and affect the prices we, or they, may obtain.\nIn the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval\nof our drug candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability, or the ability of any future collaborators, to profitably sell any drugs for which we, or they, obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any future collaborators, may receive for any approved drugs. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope, our business could be materially harmed.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031 under the CARES Act. Pursuant to subsequent legislation, however, these Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended through the end of March 2022. From April 2022 through June 2022 a 1% sequester cut is scheduled to go into effect, with the full 2% cut scheduled to resume thereafter. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our products or product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product is prescribed or used.\nSince enactment of the ACA, there have been and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, Congress repealed the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. Further, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the 2017 Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court heard this case on November 10, 2020 and on June 17, 2021, dismissed this action after finding that the plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ACA. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.\nThe Trump Administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA, including directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On January 28, 2021, however, President Biden revoked those Executive Orders and issued a new Executive Order which directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans\u2019 access to health care and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access. Under this Executive Order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the ACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the ACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents.\nWe expect that these healthcare reforms, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product and/or the level of reimbursement physicians receive for administering any approved product we might bring to market. Reductions in reimbursement levels may negatively impact the prices we receive or the frequency with which our products are prescribed or administered. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Accordingly, such reforms, if enacted, could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop or commercialize product candidates.\nThe prices of prescription pharmaceuticals in the United States and foreign jurisdictions are subject to considerable legislative and executive actions and could impact the prices we obtain for our products, if and when licensed.\nThe prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. There have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals under Medicare and Medicaid, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. In 2020, President Trump issued several Executive Orders intended to lower the costs of prescription products and certain provisions in these orders have been incorporated into regulations. These regulations include an interim final rule implementing a most-favored-nation model for prices that would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered pharmaceuticals to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. That rule, however, has been subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction and, on December 29, 2021, CMS issued a final rule to rescind it. With issuance of this rule, CMS stated that it will explore all options to incorporate value into payments for Medicare Part B pharmaceuticals and improve beneficiaries' access to evidence-based care.\nIn addition, in October 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to develop a Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into the United States. The final rule is currently the subject of ongoing litigation, but at least six states (Vermont, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Mexico, and New Hampshire) have passed laws allowing for the importation of drugs from Canada with the intent of developing SIPs for review and approval by the FDA. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed by the Biden administration until January 1, 2023.\nOn July 9, 2021, President Biden signed Executive Order 14063, which focuses on, among other things, the price of pharmaceuticals. The Executive Order directed the HHS to create a plan to combat \u201cexcessive pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and enhance domestic pharmaceutical supply chains, to reduce the prices paid by the federal government for such pharmaceuticals, and to address the recurrent problem of price gouging.\u201d On September 9, 2021, HHS released its plan to reduce pharmaceutical prices. The key features of that plan are to: (a) make pharmaceutical prices more affordable and equitable for all consumers and throughout the health care system by supporting pharmaceutical price negotiations with manufacturers; (b) improve and promote competition throughout the prescription pharmaceutical industry by supporting market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase transparency; and (c) foster scientific innovation to promote better healthcare and improve health by supporting public and private research and making sure that market incentives promote discovery of valuable and accessible new treatments.\nAt the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare organizations and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.\nIn countries outside of the United States, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. In many countries, including those of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control and access. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we or our\ncollaborators may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed.\nReporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental drug pricing programs are complex and may involve subjective decisions. Any failure to comply with those obligations could subject us to penalties and sanctions.\nAs a condition of reimbursement by various federal and state health insurance programs, pharmaceutical companies are required to calculate and report certain pricing information to federal and state agencies. The regulations governing the calculations, price reporting and payment obligations are complex and subject to interpretation by various government and regulatory authorities, as well as the courts. Reasonable assumptions have been made where there is lack of regulations or clear guidance and such assumptions involve subjective decisions and estimates. Pharmaceutical companies are required to report any revisions to calculations, price reporting and payment obligations previously reported or paid. Such revisions could affect liability to federal and state payers and also adversely impact reported financial results of operations in the period of such restatement.\nUncertainty exists as new laws, regulations, judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, or regulations related to our calculations, price reporting or payments obligations increases the chances of a legal challenge, restatement or investigation. If a company becomes subject to investigations, restatements, or other inquiries concerning compliance with price reporting laws and regulations, it could be required to pay or be subject to additional reimbursements, penalties, sanctions or fines, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that future healthcare reform measures could be adopted, which could result in increased pressure on pricing and reimbursement of products and thus have an adverse impact on financial position or business operations.\nFurther, state Medicaid programs may be slow to invoice pharmaceutical companies for calculated rebates resulting in a lag between the time a sale is recorded and the time the rebate is paid. This results in a company having to carry a liability on its consolidated balance sheets for the estimate of rebate claims expected for Medicaid patients. If actual claims are higher than current estimates, the company\u2019s financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B Program refunds, if a pharmaceutical firm is found to have knowingly submitted any false price information related to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to CMS, it may be liable for civil monetary penalties. Such failure could also be grounds for CMS to terminate the Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which companies participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates a rebate agreement, federal payments may not be available under government programs, including Medicaid or Medicare Part B, for covered outpatient drugs.\nAdditionally, if a pharmaceutical company overcharges the government in connection with the Federal Supply Schedules program or Tricare Retail Pharmacy Program, whether due to a misstated Federal Ceiling Price or otherwise, it is required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against a company under the False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur collaborators are also subject to similar requirements outside of the United States and thus the attendant risks and uncertainties. If our collaborators suffer material and adverse effects from such risks and uncertainties, our rights and benefits for our licensed products could be negatively impacted, which could have a material and adverse impact on our revenues.\nFailure to obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent our products or product candidates from being marketed abroad.\nIn order to market and sell DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant or our product candidates in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, including certain jurisdictions covered by our AffaMed collaboration, we or our third-party\ncollaborators must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be sold in that country. We or our collaborators may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in other countries. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nAdditionally, we could face heightened risks with respect to seeking marketing approval in the United Kingdom as a result of the recent withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, may force us to restrict or delay efforts to commercialize any product candidates in the United Kingdom and restrict our ability to generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability, which could significantly and materially harm our business.\nWe expect that we will also be subject to additional risks in commercializing any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval outside the United States, including tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements; economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets; compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad; foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country; and workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States.\nCompliance with global privacy and data security requirements could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit our ability to collect and process data globally, and the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to significant fines and penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe regulatory framework for the collection, use, safeguarding, sharing, transfer and other processing of information worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Globally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy frameworks with which we must comply. For example, the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the European Union, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which took effect across all member states of the European Economic Area, or EEA, in May 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR increases our obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the EEA by expanding the definition of personal data to include coded data and requiring changes to informed consent practices and more detailed notices for clinical trial subjects and investigators. In addition, the GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Union, including the United States and, as a result, increases the scrutiny that clinical trial sites located in the EEA should apply to transfers of personal data from such sites to countries that are considered to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the United States. The GDPR also permits data protection authorities to require destruction of improperly gathered or used personal information and/or impose substantial fines for violations of the GDPR, which can be up to four percent of global revenues or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater, and it also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR provides that European Union member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of personal data, including genetic, biometric or health data. Similar laws and regulations have been approved, or are expected to be approved, in several jurisdictions beyond the European Union including the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018.\nSimilar actions are either in place or under way in the United States. There are a broad variety of data protection laws that are applicable to our activities, and a wide range of enforcement agencies at both the state and federal levels that can review companies for privacy and data security concerns based on general consumer protection laws. The Federal Trade Commission and state Attorneys General are aggressive in reviewing privacy and data security protections for consumers. New laws also are being considered at both the state and federal levels. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA-which went into effect on January 1, 2020-is creating similar risks and obligations as those created by GDPR, though the CCPA does currently exempt certain information collected as part of a clinical trial subject to the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects, known as the Common Rule. The CCPA also has been amended through a recent referendum in California that creates additional obligations beginning in 2023. At least two other states have adopted, and many other states are considering, similar legislation. A broad range of legislative measures also have been introduced at the federal level. Accordingly, failure to comply with federal and state laws (both those currently in effect and future legislation) regarding privacy and security of personal information could expose us to fines and penalties under such laws. There also is the threat of consumer class actions related to these laws and the overall protection of personal data. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our reputation and our business.\nGiven the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, preparing for and complying with these requirements is rigorous and time intensive and requires significant resources and a review of our technologies, systems and practices, as well as those of any third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors or consultants that process or transfer personal data collected in applicable jurisdictions. These changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, such as healthcare data or other personal information from our clinical trials, could require us to change our business practices and put in place additional compliance mechanisms, may interrupt or delay our development, regulatory and commercialization activities and increase our cost of doing business, and could lead to government enforcement actions, private litigation and significant fines and penalties against us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLaws and regulations governing any international operations we may have in the future may preclude us from developing, manufacturing and selling certain products outside of the United States and require us to develop and implement costly compliance programs.\nAs we expand our operations outside of the United States, such as we have begun to do with our collaboration with AffaMed, we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.\nCompliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.\nIf we expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nThe failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The Securities and Exchange Commission also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe remain highly dependent on the research and development, clinical and business development expertise of our principal members of our management, scientific and clinical team, including Antony Mattessich, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or other employees.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel is critical to our success. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u25cf provide for a classified board of directors such that only one of three classes of directors is elected each year;\n\u25cf allow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u25cf limit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from our board of directors;\n\u25cf provide for advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\u25cf require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u25cf limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u25cf require the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal specified provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nWe have been subject to legal proceedings related to the decline in our stock price, and we could be subject to similar legal proceedings in the future, which could distract our management and could result in substantial costs or large judgments against us.\nThe market prices of securities of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry have been extremely volatile and have experienced fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities.\nIn July 2017, we experienced a decline in our stock price following our announcement that we had received notice of the FDA\u2019s determination that it could not approve our NDA for DEXTENZA in its then present form. In 2017 and 2018, class action lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our current and former executive officers and shareholder derivative actions were filed against certain of our current and former executive officers, certain of our current and former board members, and two of our investors and against the company as a nominal defendant. While these legal proceedings were ultimately resolved in our and/or the applicable defendants\u2019 favor, they were distracting and were both time-consuming and costly to defend. Around this time, we also received subpoenas from the Securities and Exchange Commission seeking documents and information concerning DEXTENZA, including related communications with the FDA and investors; in May 2019, the SEC notified us that it had concluded its investigation.\nDue to the volatility in our stock price, we may be the target of similar proceedings in the future. We also may face securities class-action litigation if we cannot obtain regulatory approvals for or if we otherwise fail to commercialize DEXTENZA or our other product candidates successfully. In connection with any such legal proceedings, we could incur substantial costs and such costs and any related settlements or judgments may not be covered by insurance. We could also suffer an adverse impact on our reputation and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could cause serious harm to our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for holders of our common stock.\nOur stock price may be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for smaller biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance. As a result of this volatility, our stockholders may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased it. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u25cf our success in commercializing DEXTENZA and any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval;\n\u25cf the success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u25cf results of clinical trials of our product candidates and the product candidates of our competitors;\n\u25cf regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf the recruitment or departure of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u25cf the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u25cf the results of our efforts and the efforts of our current and future collaborators to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional products, product candidates or technologies for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases or conditions, the costs of commercializing any such products and the costs of development of any such product candidates or technologies;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf the ability to secure third-party reimbursement for our products or product candidates;\n\u25cf changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u25cf market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u25cf general economic, political and social, industry and market conditions; and\n\u25cf the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, certain holders of our convertible notes and their affiliates beneficially own approximately 9.5 million shares of our common stock and have rights, subject to specified conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering such common stock. Any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of our Credit Agreement and any future debt agreements that we may enter into, may preclude us from paying dividends without the lenders\u2019 consent or at all. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and as a result, our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company, we incur and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Global Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations generate significant legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. On January 1, 2020, we became subject to the requirement to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm because we were no longer an emerging growth company. It is both costly and challenging to maintain compliance with other provisions of Section 404. In this regard, we will continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that neither we nor, if required, our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude, within the prescribed timeframe or at all, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, it could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our collaborators or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs.\nOur internal computer systems and those of our current and any future collaborators, contractors or consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other similar disruptions. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, our competitive position could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our products and product candidates could be delayed.\nChanges in tax laws or in their implementation or interpretation may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nChanges in tax law may adversely affect our business or financial condition. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the 2017 Tax Act into law, which significantly revised the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The 2017 Tax Act, among other things, contained significant changes to corporate federal income taxation, including the reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, the limitation of the tax deduction for net interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), the limitation of the deduction for NOLs to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of NOL carrybacks, in each case, for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 (though any such NOLs may be carried forward indefinitely), the imposition of one-time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, the elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), the allowance of immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and the modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits.\nAs part of Congress\u2019 response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FFCR Act was enacted on March 18, 2020, and the CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020. Both contain numerous tax provisions. In particular, the CARES Act retroactively and temporarily (for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021) suspends application of the 80%-of-income limitation on the use of NOLs, which was enacted as part of the 2017 Tax Act. It also provides that NOLs arising in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2021 are generally eligible to be carried back up to five years. The CARES Act also temporarily (for taxable years beginning in 2019 or 2020) relaxes the limitation of the tax deductibility for net interest expense by increasing the limitation from 30 to 50% of adjusted taxable income.\nRegulatory guidance under the 2017 Tax Act, the FFCR Act and the CARES Act is and continues to be forthcoming, and such guidance could ultimately increase or lessen impact of these laws on our business and financial condition. It is also possible that Congress will enact additional legislation in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic or that additional tax legislation may also be enacted; any such additional legislation could have an impact on us. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the 2017 Tax Act, the FFCR Act or the CARES Act.", "PERMNO": 14823, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "OCUL"}
