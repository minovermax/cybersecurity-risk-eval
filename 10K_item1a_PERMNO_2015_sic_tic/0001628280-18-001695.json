Risk Factors\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should carefully consider them, along with the other information presented in this report. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.\nRisks Related to Our Transaction with The Warranty Group\nWe may not be able to successfully or timely complete the pending transaction with The Warranty Group (\u201cTWG\u201d).\nThe completion of the pending transaction with TWG is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of January 8, 2018 (the \u201cA&R Merger Agreement\u201d), including the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under antitrust laws, the receipt of certain regulatory and governmental approvals, there being no material adverse effect on the Company or TWG prior to the closing of the transaction and other customary conditions. The Company will be unable to complete the proposed transaction until each of the conditions to closing is either satisfied or waived.\nIn deciding whether to grant certain of the government approvals, the relevant governmental entity may impose certain requirements or obligations as conditions for its approval or in connection with its review. The Company can provide no assurance that it will obtain the necessary approvals or that any required conditions will not have an adverse effect on the Company following the completion of the transaction. In addition, the Company can provide no assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment of the pending transaction.\nThe A&R Merger Agreement may be terminated prior to closing under certain circumstances. For example, if at the time when the closing conditions have been met, the Company Pre-Closing Stock Price (as defined in the A&R Merger Agreement) has decreased or increased more than 20% from $95.4762, TWG or the Company, respectively, will have the right to terminate the A&R Merger Agreement unless the other party elects to adjust the consideration pursuant to the A&R Merger Agreement. The A&R Merger Agreement may also be terminated by either party if the closing has not occurred by December 17, 2018.\nMatters relating to the transaction (including integration planning) have required and will continue to require substantial commitments of time and resources, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities. The Company may be required to pay significant costs relating to the transaction, whether or not the transaction is consummated. In addition, in certain circumstances, the Company may be required to pay a termination fee or reimburse TWG\u2019s expenses in connection with a termination of the A&R Merger Agreement. For these and other reasons, our failure to complete the pending transaction could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to integrate TWG effectively we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the pending transaction.\nStrategic transactions like the TWG transaction create numerous uncertainties and risks and require significant effort and expenditures. We will need to effectively manage the integration of TWG and its personnel as well as changes in operations and systems. We may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs, including diversion of management\u2019s attention to integration of operations and corporate and administrative infrastructures; difficulties in achieving anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from combining the businesses of TWG with that of Assurant; difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; difficulties in the assimilation of employees and corporate cultures; and challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers.\nIf any of these factors impairs our ability to integrate our operations with those of TWG successfully or on a timely basis, we may not be able to realize the anticipated operating synergies and efficiencies, anticipated revenues, earnings and profitable growth and other expected benefits from combining the businesses. In addition, we may be required to spend additional time or money on integration that otherwise would be spent on the development and expansion of our business.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline following the closing of the transaction if the integration of TWG is unsuccessful, takes longer than expected or fails to achieve financial benefits to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors, or the effect of the business combination on the financial results of the combined company is otherwise not consistent with the expectations of financial analysts or investors.\nWe expect to incur significant additional indebtedness to finance our acquisition of TWG, which could affect our financial position.\nWe expect to finance our proposed acquisition of TWG with a combination of external financing, which is expected to include additional indebtedness, as well as cash on hand. Incurring additional indebtedness may have a number of consequences for us. In particular, it will require us to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on such indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash that may be available for capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends or other purposes. It may limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future on favorable terms. It may also increase our vulnerability to downturns or adverse changes in general economic, industry or competitive conditions, and limit our flexibility to plan for or react to competitive challenges in our business or market conditions.\nFollowing the announcement of our proposed acquisition of TWG, in October 2017, S&P placed the Company\u2019s debt ratings on Creditwatch Negative and Moody\u2019s placed the Company\u2019s debt and financial strength ratings under review for downgrade. Please see \u201c-Risks Related to the Company-Financial Risks--A credit rating agency downgrade of our corporate senior debt rating could significantly impact our business.\u201d\nRisks Related to the Company\nBusiness and Competitive Risks\nOur revenues and profits may decline if we are unable to maintain relationships with significant clients, distributors and other parties important to the success of our business, or renew contracts with them on favorable terms, or if those parties face financial, reputational or regulatory issues.\nThe success of our business depends largely on our relationships and contractual arrangements with significant clients, including mortgage servicers, lenders, mobile device carriers, retailers, OEMs, agents and other parties. Many of these arrangements are exclusive and some rely on preferred provider or similar relationships. If our key clients, intermediaries or other parties terminate important business arrangements with us, or renew contracts on terms less favorable to us, our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, each of our Global Lifestyle, Global Housing and Global Preneed segments receives a substantial portion of its revenue from a few clients. A reduction in business with or the loss of one or more of our significant clients could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and cash flows of individual segments or of the Company. Examples of important business arrangements\ninclude, at Global Lifestyle, relationships with mobile device carriers, retailers, OEMs and financial and other institutions through which we distribute our products and services. At Global Preneed, we have an exclusive distribution relationship with SCI relating to the distribution of our preneed insurance policies. At Global Housing, we have exclusive and non-exclusive relationships with certain mortgage lenders and manufactured housing lenders and property managers, and in turn we are eligible to insure properties securing loans guaranteed by or sold to government-sponsored entities and serviced by the mortgage loan servicers with whom we do business. In addition, the transfer by mortgage servicer clients of loan portfolios to other carriers or the participation by other carriers in insuring lender-placed insurance risks that we have historically insured could materially reduce our revenues and profits from this business.\nWe are also subject to the risk that clients, distributors and other parties may face financial difficulties, reputational issues, problems with respect to their own products and services or regulatory restrictions or compliance issues that may lead to a decrease in or cessation of sales of our products and services. If one or more of our clients or distributors, for example in the wireless and related markets, consolidate or align themselves with other companies, we may lose significant business, resulting in material decreases in revenues and profits.\nSignificant competitive pressures or changes in customer preference could affect our results of operations.\nWe compete with many insurance companies, financial services companies, mobile device repair and logistics companies, technology and software companies and specialized competitors that focus on one market, product or service for business and customers, and for agents and other distribution relationships. Some of our competitors may offer a broader array of products and services than we do or be better able to tailor those products and services to customer needs, greater diversity of distribution resources, better brand recognition, more competitive pricing, lower costs, greater financial strength, more resources or higher ratings.\nThere is a risk that purchasers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors, rather than renewing coverage with us. As a result, competition may adversely affect the persistency of our policies, as well as our ability to sell products and provide services. In addition, some of our competitors may price their products or services below ours, putting us at a competitive disadvantage and potentially adversely affecting our revenues and results of operations.\nFor Global Lifestyle, our ability to adequately and effectively price our products and services is affected by, among other things, the evolving nature of consumer needs and preferences and improvements in technology, which could result in a reduction in consumer demand and in the prices of products and services we offer. For Global Housing, our lender-placed products are not underwritten on an individual policy basis and our contracts with clients require us to issue these policies automatically when a borrower\u2019s insurance coverage is not maintained. Consequently, increases in the risks we assume for homes could potentially adversely affect our results of operations.\nNew competition and technological advancements could also cause the supply of insurance or other products and services we offer to change, which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates. New competitors could enter our markets, take business from us or require us to reduce the prices of our products and services.\nIn our lender-placed insurance business, we use a proprietary insurance-tracking administration system linked with the administrative systems of our clients to monitor the clients\u2019 mortgage portfolios to verify the existence of insurance on each mortgaged property and identify those that are uninsured. The development by others of competing systems or equivalent capabilities could reduce our revenues and results of operations.\nGeneral economic, financial market and political conditions may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and conditions in the markets in which we operate may negatively affect the results of our business segments.\nGeneral economic, financial market and political disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Limited availability of credit, deteriorations of the global mortgage and real estate markets, declines in consumer confidence and consumer spending, increases in prices or in the rate of inflation, periods of high unemployment, persistently low or rapidly increasing interest rates and disruptive geopolitical events could contribute to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the financial markets, including the market for our stock. These conditions could also affect all of our business segments. Specifically, during periods of economic downturn:\n\u2022\nindividuals and businesses may (i) choose not to purchase our insurance products, warranties and other products and services, (ii) terminate existing policies or contracts or permit them to lapse and (iii) choose to reduce the amount of coverage they purchase;\n\u2022\nclients are more likely to experience financial distress or declare bankruptcy or liquidation which could have an adverse impact on the remittance of premiums from such clients as well as the collection of receivables from such clients for items such as unearned premiums;\n\u2022\nclaims on certain specialized insurance products tend to rise;\n\u2022\nthere is a higher loss ratio on credit card and installment loan insurance due to rising unemployment and disability levels;\n\u2022\nthere is an increased risk of fraudulent insurance claims; and\n\u2022\nsubstantial decreases in loan availability and origination could reduce the demand for credit insurance that we write or debt cancellation or debt deferment products that we administer, and on the placement of hazard insurance under our lender-placed insurance programs.\nGeneral inflationary pressures may affect repair and replacement costs on our real and personal property lines, increasing the costs of paying claims. Inflationary pressures may also affect the costs associated with our preneed insurance policies, particularly those that are guaranteed to grow with the CPI. Conversely, deflationary pressures may affect the pricing of our products and services.\nConditions in the housing and lifestyle markets in which we operate, including the rate of introduction and success of new products or technologies or promotional programs and the overall health of the electronics and appliances retail markets, automobile sales market and housing and mortgage markets may also affect our business segments by impacting the demand and pricing for our products and services, the costs of paying claims or otherwise.\nWe face risks associated with our international operations.\nOur international operations face economic, political, legal, operational and other risks. For example, we face the risk of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds; burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; political or economic instability in countries in which we conduct business, including possible terrorist acts; inflation and foreign exchange rate fluctuations; diminished ability to enforce our contractual rights; differences in cultural environments and changes in regulatory requirements, including changes in regulatory treatment of certain products or services; exposure to local economic conditions; and restrictions on the repatriation of non-U.S. investment and earnings.\nIf our business model is not successful in a particular country or region or it experiences economic, political or other instability, we may lose all or most of our investment in that country or region. As we continue to expand in select worldwide markets, our business becomes increasingly exposed to these risks identified above, in particular where certain countries have recently experienced economic or political instability, such as Brazil. In addition, concerns about the European Union (the \u201cE.U.\u201d), including the status of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the E.U. (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), has caused uncertainty in the financial markets and exchange rate fluctuation. Changes to the E.U. or post-Brexit U.K. regulatory frameworks applicable to our business could increase compliance costs and negatively impact the region\u2019s economic conditions, financial markets and exchange rates, which could adversely affect our European business.\nAs we engage with international clients, we may make certain up-front commission payments or similar cash outlays, which we may not recover if the business does not develop as we expect. These up-front payments are typically supported by various protections, such as letters of guarantee, but we may not recover our initial outlays and other amounts owed to us fully or timely. As our international business grows, we rely increasingly on fronting carriers or intermediaries in certain countries to maintain their licenses and product approvals, satisfy local regulatory requirements and continue in business. If they fail to do so, our business, reputation and relationships with our customers could be adversely affected.\nFor information on the significant international regulations that apply to our Company, please see Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Regulation - International Regulation.\u201d\nCatastrophe losses, including human-made catastrophe losses, could materially reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes and non-catastrophes (losses such as theft and vandalism), particularly in our homeowners insurance businesses. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, catastrophe losses that materially reduce our profitability or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Catastrophes include reportable catastrophe losses (individual catastrophe events that generated losses in excess of $5.0 million, pre-tax and net of reinsurance). Catastrophes can be caused by various natural events, which may be exacerbated by climate change, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, floods, severe winter weather, fires and epidemics, or can be human-made catastrophes, including terrorist attacks or accidents such as airplane crashes. While the frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable, increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property, the geographic concentration of insured lives and the effects of inflation could increase the severity of claims from future catastrophes. While the exact impact of the physical effects of climate change is uncertain, changes in the global climate may cause long-term increases in the frequency and severity of storms, resulting in higher catastrophe losses, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nCatastrophe losses can vary widely and could significantly exceed our expectations. We use catastrophe modeling tools that help estimate our probable losses, but these projections are based on historical data and other assumptions that may differ\nmaterially from actual events. If the severity of an event were sufficiently high (for example, in the event of an extremely large catastrophe), it could exceed our reinsurance coverage limits and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, affecting our ability to write new business. We may also lose premium income due to a large-scale business interruption caused by a natural or human-made catastrophe or by legislative or regulatory reactions to the event. Such an event could also cause substantial volatility in our financial results from period to period and could materially reduce our profitability.\nAccounting rules do not permit insurers to reserve for such catastrophic events before they occur. Once a catastrophic event occurs, the establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, capital and financial condition.\nBecause Global Housing\u2019s lender-placed homeowners and lender-placed manufactured housing insurance products are designed to automatically provide property coverage for client portfolios, our concentration in certain catastrophe-prone states like Florida, California, Texas and New York may increase. The withdrawal of other insurers from these or other states may lead to adverse selection and increased use of our products in these areas and may negatively affect our loss experience. In addition, with respect to our preneed insurance policies, the average age of policyholders is approximately 73 years. This group is more susceptible to certain epidemics than the overall population, and an epidemic resulting in a higher incidence of mortality could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to grow our business if we cannot find suitable acquisition candidates at attractive prices and integrate them effectively or identify new areas for organic growth.\nWe expect acquisitions to play a role in the growth of some of our businesses. We recently announced the acquisition of TWG, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018. However, there can be no assurances that we will continue to be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or new venture opportunities or to finance or complete such transactions on acceptable terms. Additionally, the integration of acquired businesses may result in significant challenges and additional costs, and we may be unable to accomplish such integration smoothly or successfully.\nAcquired businesses may not provide us with the benefits that we anticipate. Acquisitions entail a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which may differ from those historically associated with our operations. These include, among other things, inaccurate assessment of liabilities; difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; difficulties in integrating systems and personnel and additional costs related thereto; failure to achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flow; an increase in our indebtedness; and a limitation in our ability to access additional capital when needed. Our failure to adequately address these acquisition risks could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to effectively identify and capitalize on opportunities for organic growth depends, among other things, on our ability to identify and successfully enter and market our services in new geographic markets and market segments, our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel, our ability to coordinate our efforts across various geographic markets and market segments, our ability to maintain and grow relationships with our existing customers and expand our customer base, our ability to offer new products and services, our ability to form strategic alliances and partnerships, our ability to secure key vendor and distributor relationships and the availability of sufficient capital. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in executing on our organic growth initiatives, or that those initiatives will provide us with the expected benefits, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nSales of our products and services may decline if we are unable to develop and maintain distribution sources or attract and retain sales representatives.\nWe distribute many of our insurance products and services through a variety of distribution channels, including mobile carriers, financial institutions, mortgage lenders and servicers, retailers, funeral homes, association groups and other third-party marketing organizations. Our relationships with these distributors are significant both for our revenues and profits. We generally do not distribute our insurance products and services through our own captives or affiliated agents. There is intense competition for distribution outlets. Agents who distribute our products are often not exclusively dedicated to us, but also market the products of our competitors. In some cases, such agents are affiliated with other insurers, which may choose to write the product they are now selling on our behalf. Therefore, we face continued competition from competing products and services.\nWe also have our own sales representatives. We depend in large part on our sales representatives and segment executives to develop and maintain client relationships. Our inability to attract and retain effective sales representatives and executives with key client relationships could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to successfully manage outsourcing activities could adversely affect our business.\nAs we continue to improve operating efficiencies across the business, we have outsourced and may continue to outsource selected functions to venders and other third parties, including independent contractors. For example, we outsource certain key functions in our mortgage solutions businesses to certain independent contractors who we believe offer us expertise, as well as scalability and cost effective services. We have also outsourced certain business and information technology services, as well as call center services. We generally take steps to monitor and regulate the performance of these independent third parties, but our vendor oversight controls could prove inadequate. If these third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to the Company as a result of their performance, changes in their operations, financial condition or other matters beyond our control, or if they fail to protect our data or the data of our customers, the Company\u2019s operations and reputation could be compromised and we could suffer adverse legal and regulatory consequences. In addition, if we are unable to attract and retain relationships with qualified independent contractors, or if changes in law or judicial decisions require such independent contractors to be classified as employees, our mortgage solutions businesses could be significantly adversely affected.\nTo the extent the Company outsources selected services or functions to third parties outside the U.S., the Company is exposed to the risks that accompany operations in a foreign jurisdiction, including international economic and political conditions, foreign laws and fluctuations in currency values and, potentially, increased risk of data breaches. For more information on the risks associated with outsourcing to international third parties, please see Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to the Company - Business and Competitive Risks - We face risks associated with our international operations.\u201d If third party providers do not perform as anticipated, we may not fully realize the anticipated economic and other benefits of this outsourcing, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA decline in the value of devices in our inventory or subject to guaranteed buybacks could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nThe value of the mobile devices that we collect and refurbish for our clients may fall below the prices we have paid or guaranteed, which could affect our profitability. In our mobile business, we carry inventory to meet delivery requirements of certain clients and we provide the guaranteed buyback of devices as part of our trade-in and upgrade offerings. These devices are ultimately disposed of through sales to third parties. Our mobile business is subject to the risk that the value of the devices will be adversely affected by price reductions or technological changes affecting the usefulness or desirability of the devices and parts, physical problems resulting from faulty design or manufacturing, as well as increased competition and growing industry emphasis on cost containment. If the value of devices is significantly reduced, it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nThe markets in which we operate may be subject to periodic negative publicity, which may negatively affect our financial results.\nWe communicate with and distribute our products and services ultimately to individual consumers. There may be a perception that some of these purchasers may be unsophisticated and in need of consumer protection. Accordingly, from time to time, consumer advocacy groups or the media may focus attention on our products and services, thereby subjecting us to negative publicity.\nWe may also be negatively affected if another company in one of our industries or in a related industry engages in practices resulting in increased public attention to our businesses. Negative publicity may also result from judicial inquiries, unfavorable outcomes in lawsuits, or regulatory or governmental action with respect to our products, services and industry commercial practices. Negative publicity may cause increased regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices as well as increased litigation or enforcement action by civil and criminal authorities. Additionally, negative publicity may increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by impeding our ability to market our products and services, constraining our ability to price our products appropriately for the risks we are assuming, requiring us to change the products and services we offer, or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate.\nThe success of our business depends on our successfully implementing our strategy and the continuing service of key executives, the members of our senior management team and other highly-skilled personnel.\nThe Company recently underwent a multi-year transformation to position itself for long-term profitable growth. This process included a business portfolio realignment to focus on the housing and lifestyle markets and a new global enterprise operating model. In connection with the transformation, the Company substantially exited the health insurance market and sold its employee benefits business. In addition, the Company began the implementation of new global organizational structures for its business operations under a COO and key support functions. The Company appointed key executives such as a new CFO and a newly created Chief Technology Officer and Chief Risk Officer. As part of the new global organizational model, the Company integrated decentralized business operating structures and support functions in order to increase efficiencies and achieve cost savings. However, the Company will continue to incur costs related to the transformation, including investments in information technology, procurement and other initiatives, as well as costs associated with businesses in run off or that have\nbeen sold. The Company\u2019s long-term strategy depends on the successful execution of its strategy, including our ability to make the necessary adjustments to our cost structure, achieve efficiencies and attract and retain personnel.\nWe also rely on the continued service of key executives, members of our senior management team and highly-skilled personnel throughout all levels of our business. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel or maintain our corporate culture. We believe that our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented and highly-skilled personnel. Doing so may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, employee tolerance for the significant amount of change within and demands on our company, the effectiveness of our compensation programs and competition. If we do not succeed in retaining and motivating our existing key employees and in attracting new key personnel, our revenue growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for and successfully carry out the succession of our senior management and other key executives.\nEmployee misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.\nOur reputation is critical to maintaining and developing relationships with our clients and distributors. Our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. We could be subject to litigation, regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation or financial position if an employee were to engage or be accused of engaging in illegal or suspicious activities. Employee misconduct could also prompt regulators to allege or to determine, on the basis of such misconduct, that we have not established adequate supervisory systems and procedures to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect and deter violations of such rules. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct by employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business.\nFinancial Risks\nOur actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, requiring us to establish additional reserves or to incur additional expense for settling unreserved liabilities, which could materially affect our results of operations, profitability and capital.\nWe maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate exposure for claims and claim adjustment expenses with respect to reported claims and incurred but not reported claims (\u201cIBNR\u201d) as of the end of each accounting period. Whether calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of American (\u201cGAAP\u201d), Statutory Accounting Principles (\u201cSAP\u201d) or accounting principles applicable in foreign jurisdictions, reserves are estimates. Reserving is inherently a matter of judgment; our ultimate liabilities could exceed reserves for a variety of reasons, including changes in macroeconomic factors (such as unemployment and interest rates), case development and other factors. From time to time, we also adjust our reserves, and may adjust our reserving methodology, as these factors and our claims experience changes. Reserve development, changes in our reserving methodology and paid losses exceeding corresponding reserves could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Please see \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion & Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies & Estimates - Reserves\u201d for additional detail on our reserves.\nWe may be unable to accurately predict and price for claims and other costs, which could reduce our profitability.\nOur profitability could vary depending on our ability to predict and price for claims and other costs including, but not limited to, the frequency and severity of property claims. This ability could be affected by factors such as inflation, changes in the regulatory environment, changes in industry practices, changes in legal, social or environmental conditions, or new technologies. Political or economic conditions can also affect the availability of programs on which our business may rely to accurately predict claims and other costs. The inability to accurately predict and price for claims and other costs could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA.M. Best, Moody\u2019s and S&P rate the financial strength of our insurance company subsidiaries, and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease.\nRatings are important considerations in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. A.M. Best rates most of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries. Moody\u2019s rates four of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries and S&P rates five of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries. These ratings are subject to periodic review by A.M. Best, Moody\u2019s and S&P, and we cannot assure that we will be able to retain them. Rating agencies may change their methodology or requirements for determining ratings, or they may become more conservative in assigning ratings. Rating agencies or regulators could also increase capital requirements for the Company\u2019s subsidiaries. Any reduction in these ratings could materially adversely affect the demand for our products from intermediaries and consumers and materially adversely affect our results.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our operations had a significant number of contracts that contain provisions that require the applicable subsidiaries to maintain minimum financial strength ratings, typically from A.M. Best, ranging from \u201cA\u201d or better to \u201cB+\u201d or better, depending on the contract. Our clients may terminate these contracts or fail to renew them if the subsidiaries\u2019 ratings fall below these minimums. Termination or failure to renew these agreements could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA credit rating agency downgrade of our corporate senior debt rating could significantly impact our business.\nCurrently, the Company\u2019s senior debt is rated BBB+ by S&P and Baa2 by Moody\u2019s. Following the announcement of the transaction with TWG, in October 2017, S&P placed the Company\u2019s debt ratings on Creditwatch Negative and Moody\u2019s placed the Company\u2019s debt and financial strength ratings under review for downgrade.\nIf our senior debt credit ratings were downgraded, our business, financial position and results of operations, and perceptions of our financial strength, could be adversely affected. In particular, a decrease in our senior debt credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, increase our borrowing costs, decrease demand for our debt securities and increase the expense and difficulty of financing our operations. We could also be subject to more restrictive financial and operational covenants in any indebtedness we issue in the future, which could reduce our operational flexibility. There can be no assurance that our credit ratings will not be downgraded.\nFluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies may materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWhile most of our costs and revenues are in U.S. dollars, some are in other currencies. Because our financial results in certain countries are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation, the results of our operations have been and may continue to be affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. To a large extent, we do not currently hedge foreign currency risk. If the U.S. dollar weakens against a local currency, the translation of our foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, net revenue, operating expenses and net income or loss. Similarly, our net assets, net revenue, operating expenses and net income or loss will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against local currency. These fluctuations in currency exchange rates may result in gains or losses that materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAn impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and book value.\nGoodwill represented 21% of our total equity as of December 31, 2017. We review our goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or more frequently if circumstances indicating that the asset may be impaired exist or we change our reportable segments and related reporting units. Such circumstances could include a sustained significant decline in our share price, a decline in our actual or expected future cash flows or income, a significant adverse change in the business climate, or slower growth rates, among others. Circumstances such as those mentioned above could trigger an impairment of some or all of the remaining goodwill on our balance sheet, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and book value per share. For more information on our annual goodwill impairment testing and the goodwill of our segments, please see \u201cItem 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis - Critical Factors Affecting Results - Value and Recoverability of Goodwill.\u201d In addition, other intangible assets collectively represented 7% of our total equity as of December 31, 2017. An impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, or significant reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and book value.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. While management has certified that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017, because internal control over financial reporting is complex, we cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in the future. Any failure to implement required controls, or difficulties encountered in their operation, could adversely affect our results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we are not able to maintain or document effective internal control over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm would be unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or opine that our financial statements fairly present, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company in conformity with GAAP. Internal control deficiencies may also prevent us from reporting our financial information on a timely basis or cause us to restate previously issued financial information, and thereby subject us to litigation and adverse regulatory consequences, including fines and other sanctions, and result in a breach of the covenants under our credit agreements. Investor confidence in the Company and the reliability of our financial statements could erode, resulting in a decline in our share price and impairing our ability to raise capital.\nUnfavorable conditions in the capital and credit markets may significantly and adversely affect our access to capital and our ability to pay our debts or expenses.\nIn previous years, the global capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption. In many cases, companies\u2019 ability to raise money was severely restricted. Although conditions in the capital and credit markets are currently stable, they could again deteriorate. Our ability to borrow or raise money is important if our operating cash flow is insufficient to pay our expenses, meet capital requirements, repay debt, pay dividends on our common stock or make investments. The principal sources of our liquidity are insurance premiums, fee income, cash flow from our investment portfolio and liquid assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily convertible into cash. Sources of liquidity in normal markets also include a variety of short-and long-term instruments.\nIf our access to capital markets is restricted, our cost of capital could increase, thus decreasing our profitability and reducing our financial flexibility. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and statutory capital position could be materially and adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets.\nThe value of our investments could decline, affecting our profitability and financial strength.\nInvestment returns are an important part of our profitability. Significant fluctuations in the fixed maturity market could impair our profitability, financial condition and cash flows. Our investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities. In addition, certain factors affecting our business, such as volatility of claims experience, could force us to liquidate securities or other investments prior to maturity, causing us to incur capital losses. See \u201cItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.\u201d\nMarket conditions, changes in interest rates and prolonged periods of low interest rates may materially affect our results.\nRecent periods have been characterized by low interest rates. A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at historically low levels may result in lower-than-expected net investment income and larger required reserves. In addition, certain statutory capital requirements are based on formulas or models that consider interest rates and a prolonged period of low interest rates may increase the statutory capital we are required to hold.\nChanges in interest rates may materially adversely affect the performance of some of our investments. Interest rate volatility may materially increase or reduce unrealized gains or unrealized losses in our portfolios. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Fixed maturity and short-term investments represented 86% of the fair value of our total investments as of December 31, 2017.\nThe fair market value of the fixed maturity securities in our portfolio and the investment income from these securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. Because all of our fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale, changes in the market value of these securities are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. Their fair market value generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income from fixed maturity investments increases or decreases directly with interest rates. In addition, actual net investment income and cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. An increase in interest rates will also decrease the net unrealized gains in our current investment portfolio.\nWe employ asset/liability management strategies to manage the adverse effects of interest rate volatility and the likelihood that cash flows are unavailable to pay claims as they become due. Our asset/liability management strategies do not completely eliminate the adverse effects of interest rate volatility, and significant fluctuations in the level of interest rates may require us to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a significant loss to pay claims. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur preneed insurance policies are subject to increasing death benefits. In extended periods of declining interest rates or rising inflation, there may be compression in the spread between the death benefit growth rates on these policies and the investment income that we can earn, resulting in a negative spread. As a result, declining interest rates or high inflation rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our overall financial condition. See \u201cItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Inflation Risk\u201d.\nOur investment portfolio is subject to various risks that may result in realized investment losses.\nWe are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio, primarily from our investments in corporate bonds, preferred stocks, leveraged loans, municipal bonds, and commercial mortgages. Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in the continued recognition of investment losses. The value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the corporate bonds included in the portfolio and by other factors that may result in the continued recognition of other-than-temporary impairments. Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio.\nFurther, the value of any particular fixed maturity security is subject to impairment based on the creditworthiness of a given issuer. As of December 31, 2017, fixed maturity securities represented 84% of the fair value of our total invested assets. Our fixed maturity portfolio also includes below investment grade securities (rated \u201cBB\u201d or lower by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations). These investments comprise approximately 5% of the fair value of our total investments as of December 31, 2017 and generally provide higher expected returns but present greater risk and can be less liquid than investment grade securities. A significant increase in defaults and impairments on our fixed maturity investment portfolio could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Credit Risk\u201d for additional information on the composition of our fixed maturity investment portfolio.\nWe currently invest in equity securities representing approximately 3% of the fair value of our total investments as of December 31, 2017. However, we have had higher percentages in the past and may make more such investments in the future. Investments in equity securities generally provide higher expected total returns but present greater risk to preservation of capital than our fixed maturity investments. Beginning January 1, 2018, all such equity securities will be required to have all changes in fair value reflected through the income statement which may increase the volatility of financial results (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for more information).\nIf treasury rates or credit spreads were to increase, the Company may have additional realized and unrealized investment losses and increases in other-than-temporary impairments. The determination that a security has incurred an other-than-temporary decline in value requires the judgment of management. Inherently, there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments. Changes in facts, circumstances, or critical assumptions could cause management to conclude that further impairments have occurred. This could lead to additional losses on investments. For further details on net investment losses and other-than-temporary-impairments, please see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report.\nOur commercial mortgage loans and real estate investments subject us to liquidity risk.\nOur commercial mortgage loans on real estate investments (which represented approximately 6% of the fair value of our total investments as of December 31, 2017) are relatively illiquid. If we require extremely large amounts of cash on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments at attractive prices and in a timely manner.\nThe risk parameters of our investment portfolio may not assume an appropriate level of risk, thereby reducing our profitability and diminishing our ability to compete and grow.\nIn pricing our products and services, we incorporate assumptions regarding returns on our investments. Market conditions may not allow us to invest in assets with sufficiently high returns to meet our pricing assumptions and profit targets over the long term. If, in response, we choose to increase our product prices, our ability to compete and grow may be diminished.\nThe recently enacted U.S. tax reform bill will have a significant impact on our results of operation and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d) was enacted, which significantly amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The TCJA, among other things, reduces the corporate tax rate from a statutory rate of 35% to 21%, imposes a one-time transition tax on offshore earnings at reduced rates, allows immediate deductions for certain new investments and modifies or repeals many business deductions. While we are currently evaluating the effects of the TCJA, we expect the legislation will have a favorable impact on our financial results beginning in 2018. In addition, the enactment of the TCJA resulted in a favorable tax benefit of $177.0 million as a result of the Federal corporate rate change as applied to our deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the enactment date. We also estimate that the one-time transition tax will have no impact on our results of operation. However, the overall impact of the TCJA is uncertain due to the ambiguities in the application of certain provisions of the TCJA, the impact of future guidance, interpretations or rules issued by government agencies in applying the TCJA and potential court decisions interpreting the legislation. Changes in the application or interpretation of the TCJA could have an adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition.\nThe value of our deferred tax assets could become impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn accordance with applicable income tax guidance, the Company must determine whether its ability to realize the value of its deferred tax asset or to recognize certain tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions is \u201cmore likely than not.\u201d Under current income tax guidance, a deferred tax asset should be reduced by a valuation allowance, or a liability related to uncertain tax positions should be accrued, if, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carry-forward periods.\nIn determining the appropriate valuation allowance, management made certain judgments relating to recoverability of deferred tax assets, use of tax loss and tax credit carry-forwards, levels of expected future taxable income and available tax\nplanning strategies. The assumptions in making these judgments are updated periodically on the basis of current business conditions affecting the Company and overall economic conditions. These management judgments are therefore subject to change due to factors that include, but are not limited to, changes in our ability to realize sufficient taxable income of the same character in the same jurisdiction or in our ability to execute other tax planning strategies. Furthermore, any future changes in tax laws could impact the value of our deferred tax assets. Management will continue to assess and determine the need for, and the amount of, the valuation allowance in subsequent periods. Any change in the valuation allowance could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nReinsurance may not be available or adequate to protect us against losses, and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers.\nAs part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various operating segments. Although the reinsurer is liable to us for claims properly ceded under the reinsurance arrangements, we remain liable to the insured as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. Ceded reinsurance arrangements therefore do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims. We are subject to credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. The inability to collect amounts due from reinsurers could materially adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition.\nReinsurance for certain types of catastrophes could become unavailable or prohibitively expensive for some of our businesses. In such a situation, we might also be adversely affected by state regulations that prohibit us from excluding catastrophe exposures or from withdrawing from or increasing premium rates in catastrophe-prone areas.\nOur reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal. We may not be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities and, even where highly desirable or necessary, we may not be able to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. Inability to obtain reinsurance at favorable rates or at all could cause us to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments, to take more risk, or to incur higher costs. These developments could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThrough reinsurance, we have sold businesses that could again become our direct financial and administrative responsibility if the reinsurers become insolvent.\nIn the past, we have sold, and in the future we may sell, businesses through reinsurance ceded to third parties. For example, in 2000 we sold our Long Term Care (\u201cLTC\u201d) division to John Hancock Life Insurance Company (\u201cJohn Hancock\u201d), now a subsidiary of Manulife Financial Corporation; in 2001 we sold the insurance operations of our Fortis Financial Group (\u201cFFG\u201d) division to The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (\u201cThe Hartford\u201d); and in 2016, we sold our Assurant Employee Benefits segment to Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (\u201cSun Life\u201d). Most of the assets backing reserves coinsured under these sales are held in trusts or separate accounts. However, if the reinsurers became insolvent, the assets in the trusts and/or the separate accounts could prove insufficient to support the liabilities that would revert to us.\nIn January 2013, The Hartford sold its Individual Life Operations to Prudential Financial, Inc. (\u201cPrudential\u201d). Included in this transaction are the individual life policies remaining in force that were originally transferred to The Hartford as part of the sale of FFG. The assets backing the reserves coinsured from The Hartford to Prudential continue to be held in trusts or separate accounts, and we are subject to the risk that the trust and/or separate account assets are insufficient to support the liabilities that would revert to us. Although The Hartford remains responsible for the sufficiency of the assets backing the reserves, we face risks related to any administrative system changes Prudential implements in administering the business.\nThe A.M. Best ratings of The Hartford, John Hancock and Sun Life are currently B++ with a developing outlook, A+ and A+, respectively. A.M. Best currently maintains a stable outlook on each of their financial strength ratings.\nWe also face the risk of again becoming responsible for administering these businesses in the event of reinsurer insolvency. We do not currently have the administrative systems and capabilities to process these businesses. Accordingly, we would need to obtain those capabilities in the event of an insolvency of one or more of the reinsurers. We might be forced to obtain such capabilities on unfavorable terms with a resulting material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, third parties to whom we have sold businesses in the past may in turn sell these businesses to other third parties, and we could face risks related to the new administrative systems and capabilities of these third parties in administering these businesses.\nFor more information on these arrangements, including the reinsurance recoverables and risk mitigation mechanisms used, please see \u201cItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks - Credit Risk.\u201d\nDue to the structure of our commission program, we are exposed to risks related to the creditworthiness and reporting systems of some of our agents, third party administration and clients.\nWe are subject to the credit risk of some of the clients, third party administrators and agents with which we contract in our businesses. For example, we advance agents' commissions as part of our preneed insurance offerings. These advances are a percentage of the total face amount of coverage. There is a one-year payback provision against the agency if death or lapse\noccurs within the first policy year. If SCI, which receives the largest shares of such agent commissions, were unable to fulfill its payback obligations, this could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, some of our clients, third party administrators and agents collect and report premiums or pay claims on our behalf. These parties' failure to remit all premiums collected or to pay claims on our behalf on a timely and accurate basis could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe inability of our subsidiaries to pay sufficient dividends to the holding company could prevent us from meeting our obligations and paying future stockholder dividends.\nAs a holding company whose principal assets are the capital stock of our subsidiaries, Assurant, Inc. relies primarily on dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations, to repurchase shares or debt, to acquire new businesses and to pay dividends to stockholders and corporate expenses. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and to make such other payments depends on their statutory surplus, future statutory earnings, rating agency requirements and regulatory restrictions. Except to the extent that Assurant, Inc. is a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of the subsidiaries\u2019 creditors, including policyholders, have priority over our claims with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiaries. If any of our subsidiaries should become insolvent, liquidate or otherwise reorganize, our creditors and stockholders will have no right to proceed against their assets or to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of the subsidiary under applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up laws. The applicable insurance laws of the jurisdiction where each of our insurance subsidiaries is domiciled would govern any proceedings relating to that subsidiary, and the insurance authority of that jurisdiction would act as a liquidator or rehabilitator for the subsidiary. Both creditors and policyholders of the subsidiary would be entitled to payment in full from the subsidiary\u2019s assets before Assurant, Inc., as a stockholder, would be entitled to receive any distribution from the subsidiary.\nThe payment of dividends by any of our regulated domestic insurance company subsidiaries in excess of specified amounts (i.e., extraordinary dividends) must be approved by the subsidiary\u2019s domiciliary state department of insurance. Ordinary dividends, for which no regulatory approval is generally required, are limited to amounts determined by a formula, which varies by state. The formula for the majority of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled is based on the prior year\u2019s statutory net income or 10% of the statutory surplus as of the end of the prior year. Some states limit ordinary dividends to the greater of these two amounts, others limit them to the lesser of these two amounts and some states exclude prior year realized capital gains from prior year net income in determining ordinary dividend capacity. Some states have an additional stipulation that dividends may only be paid out of earned surplus. If insurance regulators determine that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as payments under a tax sharing agreement or payments for employee or other services) would be adverse to policyholders or creditors, they may block such payments that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval. Future regulatory actions could further restrict the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends. For more information on the maximum amount our subsidiaries could pay us in 2018 without regulatory approval, see \u201cItem 5 - Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Dividend Policy.\u201d\nAssurant, Inc.\u2019s credit facilities also contain limitations on our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders if we are in default or such dividend payments would cause us to be in default of our obligations under the credit facilities.\nAny additional material restrictions on the ability of insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect Assurant, Inc.\u2019s ability to pay any dividends on our common stock and/or service our debt and pay our other corporate expenses.\nTechnology, Cybersecurity and Privacy Risks\nThe failure to effectively maintain and modernize our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to maintain effective information technology systems and to enhance our technology to support the Company\u2019s business in an efficient and cost-effective manner. This requires us to maintain effective planning and management processes and certain other automated management and accounting systems as well as to continually upgrade product and service offerings and support growth, as our ability to integrate our systems with those of our clients is critical to our success. Our information systems rely on the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources to maintain and enhance existing systems as well as develop and create new systems and products to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology or evolving industry and regulatory requirements. We must also integrate the systems of acquired businesses effectively so that technology gained through acquisitions meets the required level of security and performance capabilities to avoid additional risk to existing operations. We periodically update our operations and financial systems, procedures and controls; however; we still rely on manual processes and procedures that may not scale proportionately with our business growth. Our information systems will continue to require automation, modifications and improvements to respond to current and future changes in our business. If we are unable to implement appropriate systems, procedures and controls, we may not be able to successfully offer our products and grow our business and account for transactions in an appropriate and timely manner. System\ndevelopment projects may be more costly or time-consuming than anticipated and may not deliver the expected benefits upon completion. In addition, our employees or agents could fail to monitor or implement enhancements or other modifications to a system in a timely or effective manner, or fail to complete appropriate controls when implementing new systems or updating current systems. This could cause significant disruption to our business. If we fail to maintain systems that function effectively without interruption (including through a failure to replace or update redundant or obsolete hardware, applications or software systems), or fail to update our systems to support our transformation and keep pace with technological advancements, our relationships and ability to conduct our business may be adversely affected. In addition, a failure to implement in a timely manner appropriate internal systems, procedures and control could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could incur significant liability if our information systems are breached or we otherwise fail to protect the security of data residing on our systems, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe receive and are required to protect confidential and other sensitive information, including personal data, that we receive from our customers, vendors and other third parties. We rely on the uninterrupted and secure operation of our information technology systems to securely process, transmit and store this information. In the normal course of business, we also share confidential and other sensitive information with our vendors and other third parties. Our information technology systems and those of our vendors and other third parties are vulnerable to threats from computer viruses, malware, ransomware, cyber-attack and other similar breach events. Our systems are also subject to compromise from internal threats such as improper action by employees, vendors and other third parties who may have otherwise legitimate access to our systems.\nCyber threats are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated. Our data protection measures may not be effective to protect our network and systems from such threats, which could result in the misappropriation or compromise of data, fraud, system disruption or shutdown. Certain measures that could increase the security of our infrastructure take significant time and resources to deploy broadly, and may not be effective against an attack in any event. We also may be unable to detect an incident, assess its severity or impact, or appropriately respond in a timely manner. The inability to implement and maintain effective protective measures and other safeguards or adequately respond to a breach could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have numerous vendors and other third parties who receive data from us in connection with the services we offer our customers. We are at risk of a cyber-attack involving a vendor or other third party, which could result in a breakdown of such third party\u2019s data protection measures. To the extent that a vendor or third party suffers a cyber-attack that compromises their operations, our data or the data of our customers could be compromised or we may experience possible service interruption, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDue to the large number and age of the systems and platforms that we operate and the increased frequency at which vendors issue security patches to their products, we are at risk that we cannot deploy patches or otherwise respond to cyber threats in a timely and effective manner. We are also dependent on vendors and other third parties like cloud service providers to keep their systems patched in order to protect our data. If we and our vendors are unable to keep systems patched in a timely manner, we or they may be breached, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur policies, procedures and technical safeguards may also be insufficient to prevent or detect improper access to confidential, personal or proprietary information by employees, vendors or other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems.\nUnauthorized disclosure of data could cause our customers to lose faith in our ability to protect their information and they may cease to do business with us. Data breaches could lead to claims against the Company, result in legal or regulatory action, including significant fines and penalties and harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We could also experience other adverse consequences resulting from the loss or inappropriate disclosure of data, including a disruption in our operations, unfavorable underwriting and reserving decisions and internal control deficiencies. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to mitigate the damage caused by any security breach and to protect against future damage. In addition, our liability insurance, which includes cyber insurance, may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches.\nThe costs of complying with, or our failure to comply with, U.S. and foreign laws related to privacy, data security and data protection, such as the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation, could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and our reputation.\nIn providing services and solutions to our customers and operating our business, we store and transfer sensitive customer, end-consumer and Company data, including personal data, in and across multiple jurisdictions. As a result, we are or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security. These laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. For\nexample, in April 2016 the European Commission adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of its laws and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, such as the public disclosure of significant data breaches, privacy impact assessments, data portability and the appointment of data protection officers. At the state level, the New York State Department of Financial Services has issued cybersecurity regulations that impose an array of detailed security measures on covered entities. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time and may restrict the way services involving data are offered, all of which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nUnauthorized disclosure or transfer of personal or otherwise sensitive data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, by the Company, our vendors or other parties with whom we do business could subject us to significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. For example, under the GDPR, violations could result in a fine of up to 4% of a corporation\u2019s global annual revenue. Such events could also result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation and cause us to lose clients, which could therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations, which increase our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business. Violations or alleged violations of such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the United States and its various states, the European Union and its member states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, we are subject to regulation by state insurance regulators in the United States, by the Prudential Regulatory Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom and agencies such as the SEC, both in our capacity as a publicly-traded company and through our investment advisory business. We are also subject to anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, trade sanctions and anti-money laundering laws and export control regulations and restrictions. We are subject to other laws and regulations on matters as diverse as internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, data privacy and protection, taxation, environmental protection, anti-trust, wage-and-hour standards and employment and labor relations.\nFurthermore, our domestic and international insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulatory oversight including but not limited to restrictions and requirements related to licensing; capital, surplus and dividends; underwriting limitations; the ability to enter and exit markets; statutory accounting and other disclosure requirements; coverage; the ability to provide, terminate or cancel certain coverages; premium rates, including regulatory ability to disapprove or reduce the premium rates companies may charge; trade and claims practices; content of disclosures to consumers; type, amount and valuation of investments; assessments or other surcharges for guaranty funds and companies\u2019 ability to recover assessments through premium increases; and market conduct and sales practices. For additional discussion of the various laws and regulations affecting our business, please see Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Regulation.\u201d\nCompliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations related to our businesses increases the costs and risks of doing business in these jurisdictions. The regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time, may impose significant operational limits on our business and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. While we attempt to comply with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we, our employees, our consultants and our contractors and other agents are in full compliance with such laws and regulations or that we will be able to comply with any future laws or regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to investigations, criminal penalties or civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, loss of an operating license or approval, increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities, the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in a particular business or redress to clients. The cost of compliance and the consequences of non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company by exposing us to negative publicity and reputational damage or by harming our client or employee relationships.\nOur business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our current and past business operations, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nindustry-wide investigations regarding business practices including, but not limited to, the use of the marketing of certain types of insurance policies or certificates of insurance;\n\u2022\nactions by regulatory authorities that may restrict our ability to increase or maintain our premium rates, require us to reduce premium rates, imposes fines or penalties and result in other expenses;\n\u2022\nmarket conduct examinations, for which we are required to pay the expenses of the regulator as well as our own expenses, and which may result in fines, penalties, or other adverse consequences;\n\u2022\ndisputes regarding our lender-placed insurance products including those relating to rates, agent compensation, consumer disclosure, continuous coverage requirements, loan tracking services and other services that we provide to mortgage servicers;\n\u2022\ndisputes over coverage or claims adjudication;\n\u2022\ndisputes over our treatment of claims, in which states or insureds may allege that we failed to make required payments or to meet prescribed deadlines for adjudicating claims;\n\u2022\ndisputes regarding sales practices, disclosures, premium refunds, licensing, regulatory compliance, underwriting and compensation arrangements;\n\u2022\ndisputes alleging bundling of credit insurance and warranty products with other products provided by financial institutions;\n\u2022\ndisputes with tax and insurance authorities regarding our tax liabilities; and\n\u2022\ndisputes relating to customers\u2019 claims that the customer was not aware of the full cost or existence of the insurance or limitations on insurance coverage.\nFurther, actions by certain regulators may cause additional changes to the structure of the lender-placed insurance industry, including the arrangements under which we track coverage on mortgaged properties. These changes could materially adversely affect the results of operations of Global Housing and the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. For additional information, see Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Regulation\u201d and Item 7, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Global Housing - Regulatory Matters.\u201d\nIn addition, the Company is involved in a variety of litigation relating to its current and past business operations and may from time to time become involved in other such actions. In particular, the Company is a defendant in class actions in a number of jurisdictions regarding its lender-placed insurance programs. These cases allege a variety of claims under a number of legal theories. The plaintiffs seek premium refunds and other relief. The Company continues to defend itself vigorously in these class actions and, as appropriate, to enter into settlements.\nWe participate in settlements on terms that we consider reasonable in light of the strength of our defenses; however, the results of any pending or future litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable and involve significant uncertainty. Unfavorable outcomes in litigation or regulatory proceedings, or significant problems in our relationships with regulators, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, our reputation, our ratings, and our ability to continue to do business. They could also expose us to further investigations or litigation. In addition, certain of our clients in the mortgage, credit card and banking industries are the subject of various regulatory investigations and litigation regarding mortgage lending practices, credit insurance, debt-deferment and debt cancellation products, and the sale of ancillary products, which could indirectly affect our businesses.\nOur business is subject to risks related to reductions in the insurance premium rates we charge.\nThe premiums we charge are subject to review by regulators. If they consider our loss ratios to be too low, they could require us to reduce our rates. Significant rate reductions could materially reduce our profitability.\nLender-placed insurance products accounted for approximately 56% and 58% of Global Housing\u2019s net earned premiums, fees and other income for the twelve months ended December 2017 and 2016, respectively. The approximate corresponding contributions to segment net income in these periods were 45% and 56%. The portion of total segment net income attributable to lender-placed products may vary substantially over time depending on the frequency, severity and location of catastrophic losses, the cost of catastrophe reinsurance and reinstatement coverage, the variability of claim processing costs and client acquisition costs, and other factors. In addition, we expect placement rates for these products to decline in 2018 as housing markets continue to improve.\nThe Company files rates with the state departments of insurance in the ordinary course of business. In addition to this routine correspondence, from time to time the Company engages in discussions and proceedings with certain state regulators regarding our lender-placed insurance business. The results of such reviews may vary. As previously disclosed, the Company has reached agreements with the New York Department of Financial Services (the \u201cNYDFS\u201d), the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (the \u201cFOIR\u201d) and the California Department of Insurance regarding the Company\u2019s lender-placed insurance business in those states. In addition, the Company has reached an agreement to settle a targeted multistate market conduct examination focused on lender-placed insurance, including a number of requirements and restrictions, in a regulatory settlement agreement (the \u201cRSA\u201d), which is applicable in all states and U.S. territories. Among other things, the terms of the RSA will require more frequent rate filings for lender-placed insurance. This could result in downward pressure on premium\nrates for these products. If such filings result in significant decreases in premium rates for the Company\u2019s lender-placed insurance products, our cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in insurance regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth.\nLegislation or other regulatory reform related to the insurance industry that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we are able to do business may significantly harm our business or results of operations in the future. If we were unable for any reason to comply with these requirements, it could result in substantial costs to us and may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, new interpretations of existing laws, or new judicial decisions affecting the insurance industry, could adversely affect our business.\nInsurance industry-related legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm our subsidiaries and us include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nimposed reductions in premium rates, limitations on the ability to raise premiums on existing policies, or new minimum loss ratios;\n\u2022\nincreases in minimum capital, reserves and other financial viability requirements;\n\u2022\nenhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future financial crises or to otherwise ensure the stability of institutions;\n\u2022\nnew licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability to offer certain types of insurance products or service contracts;\n\u2022\nprohibitions or limitations on provider financial incentives and provider risk-sharing arrangements;\n\u2022\nmore stringent standards of review for claims denials or coverage determinations;\n\u2022\nincreased regulation relating to lender-placed insurance;\n\u2022\nnew or enhanced regulatory requirements that require insurers to pay claims on terms other than those mandated by underlying policy contracts; and\n\u2022\nrestriction of solicitation of insurance consumers by funeral board laws for prefunded funeral insurance coverage.\nIn addition, regulators in certain states have hired third party auditors to audit the unclaimed property records of insurance companies operating in those states. Among other companies, the Company is currently subject to these audits in a number of states and has been responding to information requests from these auditors.\nSeveral proposals have been adopted or are currently pending to amend state insurance holding company and other laws that increase the scope of insurance company regulation. The NAIC has implemented the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (\u201cORSA\u201d), which requires U.S. insurers and insurance groups to perform an annual assessment. This requirement is being standardized across many jurisdictions. In 2017, Assurant filed ORSA reports in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Chile and Europe. Additional countries are expected to follow, with Solvency II-based regimes being implemented globally. Regulatory bodies are expected to increase the frequency of discussions between each other and the level of data sharing across borders in order to enable more consistent regulation of global companies.\nVarious state and federal regulatory authorities have taken actions with respect to our lender-placed insurance business. In January 2015, at the request of the Indiana Department of Insurance, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the \u201cNAIC\u201d) authorized an industry-wide multistate targeted market conduct examination focusing on lender-placed insurance. Several insurance companies, including our subsidiary American Security Insurance Company, were subject to the examination. In December 2016, the Company reached an agreement with the relevant regulators on the settlement of the market conduct examination pursuant to the RSA and a separate agreement with the Minnesota Department of Commerce to settle its lender-placed insurance market conduct examination (together with the RSA, the \u201cSettlement Agreements\u201d). The effectiveness of the RSA is subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions. The Settlement Agreements resolve outstanding regulatory matters related to lender-placed insurance within the scope of the examinations and will align lender-placed business practices with procedures already implemented across much of the Company\u2019s lender-placed business. The Company will also re-file its lender-placed insurance rates at least once every four years, and modify certain lender-placed business practices to which other significant providers in the lender-placed market will also be subject. We cannot predict the full effect of these or any other regulatory initiatives on the Company at this time, but they could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock may be subject to stock price and trading volume volatility. The price of our common stock could fluctuate or decline significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nIn recent years, the stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume volatility. Company-specific issues and market developments generally in the insurance industry and in the regulatory environment may have caused this volatility. Our stock price could materially fluctuate or decrease in response to a number of events and factors, including but not limited to: quarterly variations in operating results; operating and stock price performance of comparable companies; changes in our financial strength ratings; limitations on premium levels or the ability to maintain or raise premiums on existing policies; regulatory developments and negative publicity relating to us or our competitors. In addition, broad market and industry fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nApplicable laws, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, and contract provisions may discourage takeovers and business combinations that some stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.\nState laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. For example, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware may limit the ability of an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d to engage in business combinations with us. An interested stockholder is defined to include persons owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our directors, which could delay, defer or prevent a change in control. Such provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts.\nOur certificate of incorporation or by-laws also contain provisions that permit our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock, prohibit stockholders from filling vacancies on our Board of Directors, prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders and from taking action by written consent, and impose advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at stockholder meetings.\nAdditionally, applicable state insurance laws may require prior approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer. State statutes generally provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist when any person directly or indirectly owns, controls, has voting power over, or holds proxies representing, 10% or more of the domestic insurer\u2019s voting securities. Prior to granting such approval, a state insurance commissioner will typically consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the integrity of the applicant\u2019s board of directors and executive officers, the applicant\u2019s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control.", "PERMNO": 90038, "SIC": 6351, "TIC": "AIZ"}
