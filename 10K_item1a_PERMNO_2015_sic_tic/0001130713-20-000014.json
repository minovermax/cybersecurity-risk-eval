{"cik": "1130713", "company": "OVERSTOCK.COM, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAny investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Please consider the following risk factors carefully. If any one or more of the following risks were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and the market price of our securities could decrease significantly. Statements below to the effect that an event could or would harm our business (or have an adverse effect on our business or similar statements) mean that the event could or would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, which in turn could or would have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities. Many of the risks we face involve more than one type of risk. Consequently, you should read all of the risk factors below carefully, and in any reports we file with the SEC after we file this Form 10-K, before making any decision to acquire or hold our securities. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, the trading price of our securities could decline, and investors could lose part or all of their investment.\nHolders of, and potential investors in, our Series A-1 Preferred stock should also read \"Additional Risks Related Primarily to our Series A-1 Preferred stock,\" and \"Additional Risks Related to both our Series A-1 Preferred stock and our Series B Preferred stock,\" below.\nHolders of, and potential investors in, our Series B Preferred stock should also read \"Additional Risks Related to both our Series A-1 Preferred stock and our Series B Preferred stock,\" below.\nHolders of, and potential investors in, TZROP, issued by tZERO Group, Inc. should also read \"Additional Risks Related to TZROP,\" below.\nRisks Relating to Our Company and to Our Current Review of Strategic Initiatives\nWe and certain of our former and current officers and directors have been named in shareholder class action lawsuits and shareholder derivative lawsuits, which could require significant additional management time and attention, result in significant additional legal expenses or result in government enforcement actions.\nWe and certain of our former and current officers and directors have been named in shareholder class action lawsuits and shareholder derivative lawsuits, and may become subject to further litigation, government investigations or proceedings arising therefrom. The pending litigation and any future litigation, investigations or other actions that may be filed or initiated against us or our current or former officers or directors may be time consuming and expensive. We cannot predict what losses, if any, we may incur in these litigation matters, and expect to incur significant legal expenditures in defending and responding to these litigation matters.\nAny such legal proceedings, if decided adversely to us, could result in significant monetary damages, penalties and reputational harm, and will likely involve significant defense and other costs. We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and certain of our officers, requiring us to indemnify them. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims that have been or may be brought against us, and insurance coverage may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost. As a result, we may be exposed to substantial uninsured or under-insured liabilities, including pursuant to our indemnification obligations, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are both the subjects of, and parties to, investigations by the SEC Division of Enforcement, which has required us to expend significant financial and legal resources. The resolution of those investigations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn February 2018, the Division of Enforcement of the SEC informed tZERO and subsequently informed us that it is conducting an investigation and requested that we and tZERO voluntarily provide certain information and documents related to tZERO and the tZERO security token offering in connection with its investigation. In December 2018, we received a follow-up request from the SEC relating to its investigation and relating to GSR Capital Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company (\"GSR\"). As previously disclosed, on October 7, 2019, we received a subpoena from the SEC's Division of Enforcement pursuant to a formal SEC order of investigation requiring us to produce documents and other information related to the Series A-1 Preferred stock dividend we announced to stockholders in June 2019 (the \"Dividend\") and requesting 10b5-1 plans entered into by certain officers and directors. On December 9, 2019, we received a subpoena from the SEC requesting documents related to the GSR transaction and the alternative trading system run by tZERO ATS, LLC. On December 19, 2019, we received a subpoena from the SEC requesting our insider trading policies as well as certain employment and consulting agreements. We have also previously received requests from the SEC regarding GSR and our communications with our former chief executive officer and director, Patrick Byrne,\nand the matters referenced in the December 2019 subpoenas. We are cooperating with the SEC's investigation and have provided documents requested in the subpoenas.\nAlthough we believe that we have fully complied with all relevant laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that the SEC will not commence an enforcement action against us or members of our management, or as to the ultimate resolution of any enforcement action that the SEC may decide to bring. Under applicable law, the SEC has the ability to impose significant sanctions on companies and individuals who are found to have violated the provisions of applicable federal securities laws, including cease and desist orders, civil money penalties, and barring individuals from serving as directors or officers of public companies. We have expended significant financial and legal resources responding to the SEC subpoena and such responses have required a significant amount of the time and attention of our senior management and personnel. Defending any enforcement action brought by the SEC against us or members of our management would involve further significant expenditures and the resolution of any such enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, the outcome of any investigation related to the activities of tZERO could result in negative publicity for tZERO or us or limit the products which tZERO may be able to offer, which may have an adverse effect on the current and future business ventures of tZERO or us.\nOur D&O insurance policy cost could substantially increase, through increased self-retention amounts and premium increases, and coverage under our policy could fail to adequately protect us against liability for conduct of our directors and officers.\nWe carry directors and officers liability insurance (D&O insurance) for losses and advancement of defense costs in the event legal actions are brought against our directors and officers for alleged wrongful acts in their capacity as directors or officers. Our current annual D&O insurance policy, effective on October 1, 2019, contains significantly larger self-insured-retention amounts and more exclusions to coverage than in the past. As such, our D&O insurance may not be adequate to fully protect the company against liability for the conduct of its directors and officers.\nThe costs of our D&O insurance policy premiums increased substantially in the most recent annual renewal, effective October 1, 2019, compared to the prior year policy premiums. If the costs of maintaining adequate insurance coverage increases significantly in the future, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have a history of significant losses. If we do not achieve profitability or generate positive cash flow from operations in the near future, our ability to continue in business will depend on our ability to raise additional capital, obtain financing or monetize significant assets, and we may be unable to do so.\nWe have a history of significant losses and our losses have accelerated in recent years and we expect to incur operating and net losses in the foreseeable future. Net cash used in operating activities were $81.6 million during 2019, and at December 31, 2019 our accumulated deficit was $580.4 million. Our losses have accelerated in recent years and we may not be able to achieve profitability promptly or at all. We are working to improve the efficiency of our operations but may be unable to do so. Cost reductions we may implement in the future may adversely affect our business operations. If we are unable to successfully manage our business while reducing our expenses, our ability to continue in business could depend on our ability to raise sufficient additional capital, obtain sufficient financing, or sell or otherwise monetize significant assets such as our corporate headquarters. We do not expect to be able to obtain significant debt financing in the near future. Additionally, we may not be able to raise capital on acceptable terms or at all. The occurrence of any of the foregoing risks would have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe have significant negative working capital.\nOur net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was a negative $38.6 million at December 31, 2019 compared to a negative $26.2 million at December 31, 2018. Additionally, any significant declines in our revenues could result in decreases in our working capital, which would further reduce our cash balances. Our failure to generate sufficient revenues or profits or to obtain additional financing or raise additional capital could have a material adverse effect on our operations and on our ability to meet our obligations as they become due. The occurrence of any of the foregoing risks would have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nChanges in management roles and responsibilities, the loss of key personnel, or any inability to attract and retain additional personnel could affect our ability to successfully grow our business.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and on the performance of our senior management and other key personnel. Our performance also depends on our ability to retain and motivate our officers and key employees. Our former chief executive officer and director, Dr. Patrick Byrne, and our former chief financial officer, Gregory Iverson, resigned in August 2019 and September 2019, respectively. The loss of the services of these executive officers, and any of our executive officers or other key employees for any reason, could harm our business. We do not have employment agreements with any of our key personnel. Our future success, in both our e-commerce business and in our Medici business, also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly-skilled technical, managerial, editorial, merchandising, marketing and customer service personnel. Our failure to attract and retain the necessary personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nFuture sales or other distributions of our common or preferred stock may depress our stock price or subject us to limitations on our ability to use our net operating and tax credit carryforwards.\nSales or other distributions of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or our preferred stock, including our potential Series A-1 dividend, in the public market or otherwise, by us or by a significant stockholder, has in the past and could in the future, depress the trading price of our common or preferred stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. The transfer of ownership of a significant portion of our outstanding shares of common or preferred stock in the public market or otherwise, by us or by a significant stockholder, within a three-year period could adversely affect our ability to use our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable net income.\nIn addition, we may issue additional shares of our common or preferred stock from time to time in the future in amounts that may be significant. We are planning to issue approximately four million new shares of Series A-1 Preferred stock to pay the Dividend we announced in June of 2019. Further, we have sold common stock under our \"at the market\" sales agreement with JonesTrading in the past and may do so in the future. The sale of substantial amounts of our common or preferred stock, by us or a significant stockholder, or the perception that these sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading prices of either or both of these securities or subject us to limitations on our ability to use our net operating and tax credit carryforwards.\nWe are subject to the risk of possibly becoming an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\nThe Investment Company Act regulates certain companies that invest in, hold or trade securities. Primarily as a result of a portion of our assets consisting of minority investment positions, we are subject to the risk of inadvertently becoming an investment company. Because registration under the Investment Company Act would make it impractical for us to operate our business, we need to avoid becoming subject to the registration requirements of the Investment Company Act. To do so, we may structure transactions in a less advantageous manner than if we did not have Investment Company Act concerns, or we may avoid otherwise economically desirable transactions and/or strategic initiatives due to those concerns. In addition, events beyond our control, including significant appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain of our holdings or adverse developments with respect to our ownership of certain of our subsidiaries, could result in us inadvertently becoming an investment company. If it were established that we were an investment company, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that we could become subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, in an action brought by the SEC, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with us undertaken during the period it was established that we were an unregistered investment company. If it were established that we were an investment company, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial operations and our ability to continue our business.\nWe have an evolving business model, which increases the complexity of our retail and Medici businesses.\nIn prior years we added additional types of services and product offerings and in some cases, we modified or discontinued those offerings, and in some cases have re-launched offerings we had previously terminated. We may continue to try to offer additional types of products or services, and we do not know whether any of them will be successful. From time to time we have also modified aspects of our business model relating to our product mix and the mix of direct/partner sourcing of the products we offer. In addition, we continue to experiment with new technologies to enhance the customer experience and iterate on delivery of new features. The additions and modifications to our business have increased the complexity of our business and impacted our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. Further, our efforts to promote a culture of experimentation amongst our technologists in an attempt to stay ahead of the competition may result in the introduction of technologies that are less mature\nor stable which could cause problems in our website or back-end logistics systems. Future additions to or modifications of our business are likely to have similar effects. Further, any new business, technology, or website we launch that is not favorably received by consumers could damage our reputation or our brand. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nIf we fail to comply with ongoing Nasdaq listing standards and corporate governance requirements, we could be subject to delisting.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Market. In order to maintain this listing, we are required to comply with various continued listing standards, including corporate governance requirements, set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules. These standards and requirements include an obligation to maintain a Board of Directors, a majority of whom are deemed to be independent and that we maintain an Audit Committee consisting of at least three independent Board Members. Our Board of Directors currently has five members, four of whom are deemed independent, and our Audit Committee consists of three of these independent directors. If more than one of our independent directors should cease to be on the Board within a short period of time, we may not be able to recruit one or more additional independent directors in such time period in order to have a majority of independent directors on our Board and at least three independent directors on our Audit Committee. If such a scenario was not rectified in accordance with applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules, we could become subject to Nasdaq delisting procedures.\nThe size or skills of our workforce may not be adequate to execute initiatives to improve the performance of our retail business effectively or at all.\nWe have been and are currently implementing certain initiatives to improve the performance of our retail business, and any insufficiency in the size of our workforce or any insufficiency of certain required skills of our workforce, could prevent us from engaging in certain initiatives we had previously considered and could prevent us from executing such initiatives effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nOur ownership of less than 100% of our subsidiaries may cause conflicts of interest.\nOur wholly-owned subsidiary Medici Ventures owns approximately 80% of the outstanding common stock of tZERO, and tZERO employees, former employees and others own the balance of the shares. tZERO has issued employee stock options that may further dilute our ownership interest. In addition, tZERO may in the future engage in capital raising activities that could further dilute our ownership interest. Medici Ventures, tZERO and Medici Land Governance also issued employee stock options that could result in the dilution of our ownership interest in Medici Ventures, tZERO and Medici Land Governance in the future. The boards of directors of Medici Land Governance, tZERO and Medici Ventures must consider the interests of all of their stockholders, and the interests of the other stockholders may differ from our interests. Any significant divergence between our interests and the interests of other stockholders, a significant portion of whom are also likely to be employees, of our subsidiaries, could result in disagreements regarding business matters and could have an adverse effect on employee morale and on our business.\nThe options granted by Medici Ventures, tZERO and Medici Land Governance could reduce our effective ownership of each of them significantly.\nMedici Ventures, tZERO and Medici Land Governance have granted compensatory options under their respective stock option plans and warrants have also been sold to purchase Medici Ventures common stock. If all of the currently outstanding Medici Ventures options were vested and exercised and all of the currently outstanding warrants were exercised, our ownership of Medici Ventures would decrease from 100% to 89%.\ntZERO has granted compensatory options under its equity incentive plan. If all of the currently outstanding tZERO options were vested and exercised, Medici Ventures' ownership of tZERO would decrease from 80% to 74%.\nIf all of the currently outstanding Medici Ventures options and warrants and all of the currently outstanding tZERO options were exercised, our effective indirect ownership of tZERO would decrease from 80% to 66%.\nMedici Land Governance has granted compensatory options under its equity incentive plan. If all of the currently outstanding Medici Land Governance options were vested and exercised, Medici Ventures' ownership of Medici Land Governance would decrease from 35% to 34%.\nIf all of the currently outstanding Medici Ventures options and warrants and all of the currently outstanding Medici Land Governance options were exercised, our effective indirect ownership of Medici Land Governance would decrease from 35% to 30%.\nWe are exploring strategic initiatives, and decisions we make could have material adverse effects on our business and the market price of our common stock.\nWe have been and are currently exploring certain strategic initiatives, and decisions we make could change our business fundamentally and increase the risks and uncertainties of our business substantially. We are considering a range of potential transactions, including additional equity or debt financings. There can be no assurance that we will pursue or consummate any strategic transaction or, if consummated, that any such transaction will ultimately be favorable to us or our stockholders. Any such transaction could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, our exploration of strategic and financing options has required and will continue to require significant time and attention by our management, and the incurrence of significant expenses. Further, our efforts to keep investors informed about our consideration of strategic alternatives may result in distraction and unrest among our employees, which may adversely affect employee engagement, morale and retention and which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nOur previous efforts to sell our retail business could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial results and future prospects.\nAs a consequence of our previous discussions with potential bidders for our retail business, or any future discussions that may arise as a result of our previous efforts, it may be possible for potential bidders to misappropriate intellectual property and other confidential information from us, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business operations and prospects. Our previous efforts to sell our retail business could result in future offers from potential bidders and, if we sell our retail business as a result of any such offer, our revenues would decrease to an insignificant amount and we would become a much smaller company. Consequently, risks relating to our Medici businesses, including our tZERO initiatives, which may currently be immaterial to us, would likely each become material risks to us. See \"Additional Risks Relating to our Medici Business,\" and \"Additional Risks Relating to our tZERO Initiatives\" below. Our retail business is a relatively mature and predictable business compared to our Medici initiatives, which have a short history, minimal revenues, significant expenses, significant losses and significant uncertainties, and conduct business in a new and rapidly changing industry. We would continue to bear most of the expenses we currently bear as a publicly held company but would have to build a new business and develop new sources of revenue based on our blockchain initiatives, and there is no assurance that we would be able to do so or, even if we could do so, that our new business could become profitable. Further, a sale of our retail business in a taxable transaction could result in a substantial corporate level income tax expense for the Company. If we sell our retail business, at present we do not expect to submit any transaction to a stockholder vote unless we are required to do so, whether by applicable law or otherwise, and we currently expect to retain all of the after-tax proceeds of the sale for use in our blockchain initiatives. If we sell our retail business, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors may accelerate the vesting, in whole or in part, of some or all outstanding restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, which would result in an increase in the number of shares outstanding and would dilute stockholders' ownership of our company. As a result of any such actions, the market price of our securities, our business, financial results and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nStrategic relationships, joint ventures, purchases of strategic interests in other companies and acquisitions of other companies involve numerous risks, including increased regulatory and integration risks and may require additional capital investment.\nWe have developed strategic relationships, entered into joint ventures, purchased strategic interests in other companies, and acquired other companies, and we expect to pursue and engage in similar types of activities in the future. Each of these types of business transactions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the evaluation of business opportunities and risks, including regulatory and integration risks, as well as difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations and products. These types of transactions can also result in the diversion of management's attention from other business matters, employee retention issues, and the risk of liability for liabilities of acquired companies. We may not be able to successfully integrate businesses, operations, personnel, services, products or other assets that we have acquired or may acquire in the future. In addition, as discussed under \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\", we have a $5 million contingent obligation to provide additional funding in the future to our BSTX joint venture if and when, during the first 48 months after the establishment of the entity, the aggregate cash balance of BSTX's combined bank accounts fall below $2 million for any reason.\nFurther, acquisitions may also create a need for additional accounting, tax, compliance, documentation, risk management and internal control procedures, and may require us to hire additional personnel to implement, perform and/or monitor such procedures. To the extent our procedures are not adequate to appropriately implement, perform and/or monitor all necessary procedures relating to any new or expanded business, we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction. We may also recognize impairment charges as a result of future acquisitions. In addition, we may be unable to sell or otherwise monetize any of the interests or companies or other assets or rights we have acquired or may acquire in the future. We also may be unable to maintain our strategic relationships, including those with joint venture partners, or develop new strategic relationships. The occurrence of any of the foregoing which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets, and we may not be able to realize these assets in the future.\nWe have established a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets, primarily due to realized losses and uncertainty regarding our future taxable income. In addition, the transfer of ownership of a significant portion of our outstanding shares of common or preferred stock in the public market or otherwise, by us or by a significant stockholder, within a three-year period could adversely affect our ability to use our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable net income. Determining whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is appropriate requires significant judgment and an evaluation of all positive and negative evidence. At each reporting period, we assess the need for, or the sufficiency of, a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances.\nWe are currently subject to claims that we have infringed intellectual property rights of third parties and may be subjected to additional infringement claims in the future.\nWe are currently and may in the future be subject to claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, by offering allegedly infringing products or otherwise. We have contested and expect to continue to contest claims we consider unfounded rather than settling such claims, even when we expect the costs of contesting the claims to exceed the cost of settlement. Any claims may result in significant expenditure of our financial and managerial resources and may result in us making significant damages or settlement payments or changes to our business. We could be prohibited from using software or business processes, or required to obtain licenses from third parties, which could be expensive or unavailable. Any such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe may be unable to protect our proprietary technology and to obtain trademark protection for our marks.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with our employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates, and others to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including the law pertaining to trade secrets. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or trade secrets without authorization. In addition, we cannot ensure that others will not independently develop similar intellectual property. Third parties have in the past recruited and may in the future recruit our employees who have had access to our proprietary technologies, processes and operations. These recruiting efforts expose us to the risk that such employees and those hiring them will misappropriate and exploit our intellectual property and trade secrets. We may be unable to protect against such risks, in the United States or elsewhere, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we have registered and are pursuing the registration of our key trademarks in the United States and some other countries, some of our trade names may not be eligible to receive registered trademark protection. In addition, effective trademark protection may not be available or we may not seek protection in every country in which we market or sell our products and services, including in the United States. Our competitors might adopt product or service marks like our marks or might try to prevent us from using our marks. Any claim by another party against us, or customer confusion related to our trademarks, or our failure to obtain trademark registration, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nIf one or more states successfully asserts that we are liable for the collection of sales or other taxes for periods prior to the Supreme Court's recent decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, our business could be harmed.\nPrior to the Supreme Court's 2018 decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, in which we were a named party, to overturn its 1992 decision in Quill v. North Dakota, we generally did not collect sales or other similar taxes on sales of goods into states where we had no duty to do so under Quill. Some jurisdictions where we did not collect sales or other taxes have asserted that we should have done so, and other jurisdictions could in the future assert that we should have collected sales taxes or other taxes when we did not, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, regardless of the ultimate outcome.\nOur international business efforts could adversely affect us.\nWe sell products in international markets. International sales and transactions are subject to inherent risks and challenges that could adversely affect us, including:\n\u2022\nthe need to develop new supplier and manufacturer relationships;\n\u2022\nthe need to comply with additional U.S. and foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in international laws, regulatory requirements, taxes and tariffs;\n\u2022\nour limited experience with different local cultures and standards;\n\u2022\ngeopolitical events, such as war and terrorist attacks;\n\u2022\nthe risk that the products we offer may not appeal to customers in international markets; and\n\u2022\nthe additional resources and management attention required for such expansion.\nOur international business could expose us to penalties for non-compliance with laws applicable to international business and trade, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Foreign data protection, privacy and other laws and regulations are different and often more restrictive than those in the United States. Compliance with such laws and regulations will result in additional costs and may necessitate changes to our business practices, which may adversely affect our business. To the extent that we make purchases or sales denominated in foreign currencies, we would have foreign currency risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nAdditional Risks Relating to our tZERO Initiatives\ntZERO has a limited operating history, which makes it hard to evaluate its ability to generate revenue through operations, and to date, has not generated revenue from any commercially available blockchain-based applications.\ntZERO was formed in 2014 to develop blockchain and financial technology as part of Overstock's Medici initiatives. tZERO's limited operating history and the relative immaturity of the blockchain industry make it difficult to evaluate its current business and future prospects. tZERO has encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly developing and changing industries, including challenges in forecasting accuracy, determining appropriate uses of its limited resources, gaining market acceptance, managing a complex and evolving regulatory landscape and developing new products. tZERO's current or future operating model may require changes in order for it to scale its operations efficiently and be successful. Investors in our common stock should consider tZERO's business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties it faces as an early-stage company focused on developing products in the field of financial technology.\nTo date, tZERO has focused primarily on developing its business and exploring novel applications of blockchain technology. This has included developing a suite of technologies which enable the trading of digital securities (the \"tZERO Technology Stack\") and using this technology to offer products and services to potential issuers of digital securities and regulated market participants. Digital securities are conventional uncertificated securities where the issuer arranges for a digital \"courtesy carbon copy\" of the transfer agent's share registry to be viewable on the blockchain to enhance the trading experience and may also be referred to as \"digitally-enhanced securities\". tZERO has generated limited revenue, no meaningful portion of which can be attributed to its commercialization of the tZERO Technology Stack or the support of such issuers and regulated market participants and has accumulated losses since its inception. As such, tZERO has historically been dependent upon continued financial support from us. If we are unable to generate positive cash flow in our retail business, raise additional capital, obtain financing, or sell or otherwise monetize significant assets, we may be unable to continue funding tZERO at the rate or levels we would otherwise do, which could have a material adverse effect on us and on the current and future business of tZERO.\nTo date only two digital securities are traded on the tZERO ATS and, other than the tZERO ATS, no other operational exchange, alternative trading system or other regulated trading venue licenses the tZERO Technology Stack.\ntZERO continues to develop the tZERO Technology Stack and offer it as part of its services to potential issuers of digital securities and regulated market participants. As of December 31, 2019, tZERO has only utilized the tZERO Technology Stack to digitally-enhance the Series A-1 Preferred stock (exchanged from the Series A Preferred stock in May 2019) and TZROP, which are the only digital securities trading on the tZERO ATS. tZERO has been engaged to provide technology services, which will utilize the tZERO Technology Stack, to a select number of other prospective issuers of digital securities but there can be no assurance that tZERO will be engaged to provide these services by additional issuers in the future, that these services, if provided, will be profitable, or that these securities will trade on the tZERO ATS.\nAdditionally, the tZERO Technology Stack is only utilized by regulated market participants facilitating the trading of the Series A-1 Preferred stock and TZROP. These entities include the tZERO ATS, which is owned by a subsidiary of tZERO, and Dinosaur and ETC. BSTX plans to use the tZERO Technology Stack but is not yet operational and requires regulatory approval before it may begin operations. The trading of digital securities and the technology used by regulated market participants to support the trading of digital securities implicates complex technological considerations and raises numerous legal and regulatory issues that will need to be addressed-likely, in consultation with the regulators of regulated market participants facilitating such trading. As a result of these technological, legal and regulatory considerations, tZERO may not be able to successfully market and commercialize the tZERO Technology Stack to other market participants. If tZERO is unable to successfully market and commercialize the tZERO Technology Stack, tZERO's business plans would be materially adversely affected. See \"Risks Related to the Development of the tZERO Technology Stack\" below.\nThe technology on which tZERO and its subsidiaries rely for its operations may not function properly.\nThe technology on which tZERO and its subsidiaries and licensees rely, including the technology underlying the tZERO Technology Stack and the wallet and exchange services provided by tZERO Crypto, may not function properly, which would have a material adverse effect on tZERO's plans, operations and financial condition. Although the tZERO Technology Stack has worked for the Series A Preferred stock, Series A-1 Preferred stock and TZROP, trading in these securities has been extremely limited, and consequently the tZERO Technology Stack has not been tested with significant trading volume. We could experience a significant increase in trading volume for the Series A-1 Preferred stock once the planned Dividend is distributed, which will stress the tZERO Technology Stack in new ways. Similarly, while tZERO Crypto's technology has proven suitable for its wallet and exchange services mobile application to date, the volume of activity on the application has been limited, and as a result has not been tested at scale. tZERO and its subsidiaries' technology may malfunction because of errors in the underlying technology, an unanticipated increase in transactions using the technology or as a result of cyber-attacks or external security breaches. If tZERO or its subsidiaries' technology does not work as anticipated or malfunctions, any resolution of the issue may take time and be costly to implement or there may be no solution or alternative technology available. The importance of this technology to tZERO's operations means that any problems in its functionality would have a direct materially adverse effect on tZERO's plans and expectations for revenues from its blockchain applications and expose it to material loss. Any such technological problems could have a material adverse effect on tZERO's prospects, operations and financial condition and a material adverse effect on us.\ntZERO Markets may not receive the regulatory approval it requires to operate its anticipated business.\ntZERO Markets, LLC (\"tZERO Markets\") was formed in May 2019 to offer certain brokerage (including for retail customers), investment banking, placement agent and best-efforts underwriting services for traditional equities and digital securities. tZERO Markets has applied for regulatory approval, including by filing a Form BD and New Member Application with FINRA, and is in correspondence with the relevant regulators, to permit it to offer such services.\nWe believe that digital securities should be treated as any other conventional, uncertificated book-entry security. However, various regulators may disagree with this assertion and conclude that the digital securities should not be treated as a traditional investment security. For example, we do not believe that tZERO Markets will offer brokerage services with respect to any \"digital asset securities\" within the meaning of the July 8, 2019 Joint Staff Statement on Broker-Dealer Custody of Digital Asset Securities. However, federal securities regulatory authorities may disagree with that conclusion and tZERO Markets could be required to take further steps with regulators to obtain approval to start business operations. Additionally, tZERO's other broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to investigations by the SEC and FINRA, which may indirectly impact tZERO Markets' regulatory approvals. As a result, there may be delay in the receipt of the regulatory approvals tZERO Markets requires to operate, if they are received at all. In the event tZERO Markets is not able to receive the regulatory approvals it requires to provide the services it intends or there is significant delay in tZERO Markets' receipt of such approvals it may be\nforced to revise its business plan. Any such revision could have a material adverse effect on tZERO's operations and financial condition and a material adverse effect on us.\ntZERO ATS, LLC and SpeedRoute, two subsidiaries of tZERO that currently generate substantially all of tZERO's revenues, are registered broker-dealers and are subject to extensive regulation.\nBroker-dealers are subject to extensive regulatory requirements under federal and state laws and regulations and self-regulatory organization (\"SRO\") rules. tZERO ATS, LLC and SpeedRoute, which currently generate substantially all of tZERO's revenues, are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Exchange Act and in the states in which they conduct securities business and are members, and subject to the rules, of FINRA, and other SROs (as applicable). In addition, tZERO ATS, LLC owns and operates the tZERO ATS, an SEC-registered alternative trading system. tZERO ATS, LLC and SpeedRoute are subject to regulation, examination, investigation and disciplinary action by the SEC, FINRA and state securities regulators, as well as other governmental authorities and SROs with which they are registered or licensed or of which they are a member.\nAny failure of tZERO ATS, LLC or SpeedRoute to comply with all applicable rules and regulations or satisfy FINRA, the SEC, or any other regulatory authority with which such subsidiary must comply could have a material adverse effect on tZERO's operations and financial condition and a material adverse effect on us. In addition, tZERO Markets may be subject to even more extensive regulations. See \"-tZERO Markets intends to be registered as a broker-dealer and would be subject to extensive regulation, which is anticipated to be more rigorous and expensive to establish and maintain than for tZERO's other broker-dealer subsidiaries.\" below.\ntZERO Markets intends to be registered as a broker-dealer and would be subject to extensive regulation, which is anticipated to be more rigorous and expensive to establish and maintain than for tZERO's other broker-dealer subsidiaries.\ntZERO Markets has applied for regulatory approvals to allow it to conduct certain brokerage and investment banking activities, including certain activities which tZERO's other broker-dealer subsidiaries have not historically provided, in particular by providing broker-dealer services to retail investors. If these approvals are received, tZERO Markets will become a registered broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and a member of FINRA and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation and will be subject to regulation, examination, investigation and disciplinary action by the SEC, FINRA and state securities regulators, as well as other governmental authorities and SROs with which it becomes registered or licensed or of which it becomes a member. In addition, because tZERO Markets intends to provide broker-dealer services that tZERO's other broker-dealer subsidiaries have not historically provided, in particular by providing broker-dealer services to retail investors, certain of these legal and regulatory requirements will be new to tZERO. We expect that federal and state securities regulators will require enhanced supervision, compliance and control procedures for tZERO Markets as a result of servicing retail investors, and that such requirements will be more expensive to establish, implement and maintain than those for tZERO ATS, LLC and SpeedRoute.\nAny failure of tZERO Markets to comply with all applicable rules and regulations or satisfy FINRA, the SEC, or any other regulatory authority with which it must comply could have a material adverse effect on tZERO's operations and financial condition and a material adverse effect on us. See also \"-tZERO ATS, LLC and SpeedRoute, two subsidiaries of tZERO that currently generate substantially all of tZERO's revenues, are registered broker-dealers and are subject to extensive regulation.\" below.\ntZERO's broker-dealer subsidiaries and tZERO are involved in ongoing discussions with and are subject to investigation by regulatory authorities.\ntZERO's broker-dealer subsidiaries, tZERO ATS, LLC and SpeedRoute, and tZERO have been and remain involved in ongoing oral and written communications with regulatory authorities in connection with ongoing examinations, inquiries, or investigations, which may result in trading halts on the tZERO ATS and financial and other settlements or penalties. Additionally, on December 9, 2019, we received a subpoena from the SEC requesting documents related to, among other things, the tZERO ATS. Any failure of tZERO or its broker-dealers to satisfy FINRA, the SEC, or any other regulatory authority that they are in compliance with all applicable rules and regulations could have a material adverse effect on tZERO's operations and financial condition and a material adverse effect on us.\nOur ownership in tZERO is below the threshold required to permit us to use its losses to offset taxable income generated by the rest of our U.S. business and is below the threshold required to conduct a tax-free spin-off.\nDue to our ownership percentages of both tZERO common stock and TZROP, we own less than the required percentage to file a federal consolidated income tax return. tZERO therefore files a separate federal tax return from the rest of our U.S. domestic operations, and as a result, certain tax attributes, such as federal net operating losses and tax credits, generated by tZERO are not available to offset taxable income generated by the rest of our U.S. domestic operations, and vice versa. Additionally, among other gating factors, our ownership percentage is also currently below the level required to conduct a tax-free spin-off of tZERO, and therefore, at this time we do not believe that a tax-free spin-off of the tZERO business is a viable option.\nThere can be no assurance that BSTX will receive the regulatory approval it requires to operate.\ntZERO and BOX Digital have entered into a joint venture intended to develop a national securities exchange facility of BOX Exchange LLC (\"BSTX\") that would facilitate the trading of a type of digital security called a security token that would utilize the tZERO Technology Stack. The SEC published proposed rule changes relating to BSTX on October 11, 2019, soliciting public comments thereon. The SEC extended the review period on November 29, 2019 and the SEC again extended the review period on January 16, 2020. In addition, a subsequent amendment was filed by BOX Exchange LLC on February 19, 2020.\nThe application of federal securities law and other bodies of law to assets enhanced by blockchain technology is subject to significant uncertainty and likely to rapidly evolve as government agencies take greater interest in them. As a result, there may be delay in the receipt of the regulatory approvals BSTX requires to operate, if they are received at all. In the event BSTX is not able to receive the regulatory approvals it requires to begin operations or there is significant delay in BSTX's receipt of such approvals it may be forced to revise its anticipated operations. Any such revision could have a material adverse effect on tZERO's operations and financial condition and a material adverse effect on us.\ntZERO's and its subsidiaries' businesses are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, technology, data protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to their business practices, increased cost of operations or otherwise harm their businesses.\ntZERO and its subsidiaries are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to its business, including user privacy, data protection and intellectual property, among others. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. These U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which tZERO and its subsidiaries operate.\ntZERO and its subsidiaries have adopted policies and procedures they believe are appropriate to comply with these laws. The growth of their respective businesses and expansion outside of the United States may increase the potential of violating these laws or its internal policies and procedures. The risk of being found in violation of these or other laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many of these have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts and are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action brought against tZERO or its subsidiaries for violation of these or other laws or regulations, even if tZERO or its subsidiaries successfully defend against it, could cause tZERO or any of its subsidiaries to incur significant legal expenses and divert its management's attention from the operation of its business. If its operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws and regulations, it may be subject to any applicable penalty associated with the violation, including civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines, it could be required to refund payments received by it, and it could be required to curtail or cease its operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm tZERO's or any of its subsidiaries' business and their financial results. These existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede the development of new products, result in negative publicity, increase tZERO's or any of its subsidiaries' operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject any of them to claims or other remedies, including fines or demands that they modify or cease existing business practices.\nThe development and operation of tZERO's business, including the tZERO Technology Stack, will likely require, technology and intellectual property rights.\nThe ability of tZERO to operate its businesses, including its efforts to develop and market the tZERO Technology Stack, may depend on technology and intellectual property rights that tZERO may license from unaffiliated third parties. If for\nany reason tZERO were to fail to comply with its obligations under an applicable license agreement, or were unable to provide or were to fail to provide the technology and intellectual property that tZERO or any licensee requires, their operations would be negatively affected, which would have a material adverse effect on tZERO's operations and financial condition and could have a material adverse effect on us.\ntZERO may face substantial competition from known and unknown competitors as well as the risk that one or more of them may obtain patents covering technology critical to the operation of the tZERO Technology Stack.\nWe believe that a number of organizations are or may be working to develop applications for distributed ledger or blockchain technologies or other novel technologies in the financial industry or capital markets that may facilitate or enhance the experience of trading securities or other financial assets that may be competitive with tZERO's own technology, including its patented technology. As the blockchain industry matures, tZERO expects that larger existing companies in the financial services and technology industries may compete with it in providing technological solutions related to the capital markets or other potential areas of business tZERO may enter. Such competitors may develop technology for the trading of securities which may or may not utilize blockchain technology which may provide a more attractive trading solution than tZERO may be able to provide. Any or all of them may also compete with tZERO now or in the near future for the time and attention of regulators and for the services of persons with the expertise it needs. Some or all of such organizations may have substantially greater technological expertise, experience with blockchain technologies or the capital markets and/or financial resources than tZERO or Overstock has, and many of them appear to be attempting to patent technologies that may be competitive with or similar to the technology tZERO has developed and patented. tZERO does not have access to detailed information about the technologies these organizations may be attempting to patent. If other persons, companies or organizations obtain a valid patent covering technology critical to tZERO's business, tZERO, issuers of digital securities or regulated market participants that need the relevant technology in order to operate as intended might be unable or unwilling to license the technology, and it could become impossible for tZERO to successfully develop or market the tZERO Technology Stack, which could have a material adverse effect on tZERO's operations and financial condition and a material adverse effect on us.\nFurther, certain of tZERO's subsidiaries may also face competition in the areas of their respective businesses including money services, accredited investor verification services, or broker-dealer services, and these competitors may have substantially greater resources than tZERO or its subsidiaries. Any or all of them may compete with tZERO's subsidiaries now for current business or in the near future for potential business.\ntZERO Crypto's business may be limited in certain jurisdictions if it is unable to timely receive certain licenses it is in process of obtaining or due to the regulations applicable to it.\nThe business of tZERO's subsidiary tZERO Crypto, Inc. (\"tZERO Crypto\"), formerly known as Bitsy, Inc., is a mobile application that allows consumers to buy, sell and hold supported cryptocurrencies. Various aspects of the business that tZERO Crypto is engaging in are heavily regulated. Both the federal government and virtually every state in the U.S. regulates money transmitters and money services businesses. In some states, the licensing requirements and regulations expressly cover companies engaged in digital currency activities; in certain other states it is not clear whether or how the existing laws and regulations apply to digital currency activities. tZERO Crypto is applying for licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent), as required, and has obtained such licenses in many states and territories. tZERO Crypto has also registered with FinCEN. There can be no assurance that tZERO Crypto will be able to obtain money transmitter licenses on a timely basis in all states where they have not already been obtained, that they will be obtained at all, or that it will be able to retain such licenses over time as its business or applicable law and regulation evolve, which may limit the services tZERO Crypto is able to offer in certain jurisdictions or require potential product changes.\ntZERO Crypto is subject to extensive regulation.\nAs a money transmitter (or equivalent) licensed in multiple states and territories and due to its registration with FinCEN, tZERO Crypto is subject to obligations and restrictions with respect to various anti-money laundering, know-your-customer, record-keeping, reporting, capital and bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds, and examination and inspection by state and federal regulatory agencies. Regulations relating to money transmission and cryptocurrencies are evolving quickly and compliance with existing and evolving requirements requires the dedication of significant resources by tZERO Crypto. As a result, in the event tZERO Crypto was unable to comply with, or dedicate the resources necessary to comply with all rules and regulations or satisfy state and federal regulatory authorities with which it must comply, tZERO Crypto may be subject to additional liability, including governmental fines, restrictions on its business, or other sanctions, and it could be forced to cease conducting certain aspects of its business with residents of certain jurisdictions, be forced to otherwise change it business practices in certain jurisdictions, or be required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals.\nAny failure of tZERO Crypto to comply with all applicable rules and regulations or satisfy state or federal regulatory authorities with which it must comply could have a material adverse effect on tZERO's operations and financial condition and a material adverse effect on us.\ntZERO or its technology may be the subject of cyber-attacks, which may result in security breaches and the loss or theft of assets, which could expose tZERO to liability and reputational harm and could seriously curtail the utilization of tZERO's services or technology and could result in claims against tZERO or us.\nCertain of tZERO's businesses store and transmit user's proprietary information (or may do so in the future) and create technology, including the tZERO Technology Stack, which is involved in third-parties' storage and transmission of users' proprietary information. As a result, tZERO's businesses may be the subject of security breaches, computer malware and other computer hacking attacks which could expose it to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, and to resulting claims, fines, and litigation. tZERO has experienced cyberattacks and believes its systems are probed by potential hackers on a daily basis. tZERO expects the problem will continue to grow worse over time. Cyber-attacks may also target tZERO's customers or third-parties and other services on which tZERO or its customers depend on. In the event such cyber-attacks target customers utilizing tZERO's technology they may attempt to identify and exploit weaknesses in tZERO's technology to conduct a cyber-attack.\nSecurity breaches and cyber-attacks are also of particular concern to businesses, like tZERO Crypto, that directly interact with cryptocurrencies. While tZERO Crypto wallet users hold their cryptocurrency directly on their mobile devices (as opposed to being held in custody by tZERO Crypto), tZERO Crypto holds a limited cryptocurrency inventory on hand to facilitate its exchange services and has access to customer information. As a result, tZERO Crypto is subject to an increased risk of cyber-attacks, which could result in loss of cryptocurrency, unauthorized access to customer information and the resulting legal or financial exposures or the unexpected unavailability of tZERO Crypto's services.\nAny compromise of tZERO's security or that of a third-party involving tZERO's technology could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, and cause significant financial loss, legal fines and other legal exposure, damage to tZERO's reputation, and a loss of confidence in the maturity of tZERO's security program and tZERO's ability to implement security measures on par with its peers; further, a compromise of tZERO's security could reduce market participants' willingness to adopt and regularly use its technology (including the tZERO Technology Stack), any of which could have a material adverse effect on tZERO and our financial position and business.\ntZERO's core technology has been and will be, as applicable, developed by key technology employees of tZERO and its affiliates, and their operation and further development depend on the continued availability of those key employees.\nThe tZERO Technology Stack and other core technology used for tZERO's operations, have been or will be, as applicable, developed primarily by a small number of key technology employees of tZERO and its affiliates. This includes technology used for the operation of the regulated trading venues tZERO supports, including the tZERO ATS. The loss of the services of any of those key employees could have a material adverse effect on the ability of tZERO to develop, operate or maintain the tZERO Technology Stack or other technology used for tZERO's operations. If tZERO were to lose the services of any such key employees, it could be difficult or impossible to replace them, and the loss of any of them could have a material adverse effect on tZERO's operations and financial condition.\ntZERO's success will be dependent on its ability to hire, retain or motivate qualified personnel.\ntZERO's business largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals, particularly those with technology, operational and regulatory backgrounds. tZERO's future success will depend on its continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel. Without such individuals, tZERO may not have or may not be able to obtain the skills or expertise needed to successfully develop, maintain and implement the tZERO Technology Stack or its other initiatives. In addition, its compensation arrangements, such as its equity award program, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating its existing employees, which would affect its future success. Any failure by tZERO to hire, retain or motivate qualified personnel would materially adversely affect tZERO's business and us.\nTo date, SpeedRoute and tZERO ATS, LLC's revenues have come from a small number of major customers, making SpeedRoute and tZERO ATS, LLC, and by extension tZERO, vulnerable to changes in the business and financial condition of, or demand for SpeedRoute's and tZERO ATS, LLC's services by, such customers.\nTo date, the primary source of revenue for SpeedRoute and tZERO ATS, LLC has been two major customers, making SpeedRoute and tZERO ATS, LLC vulnerable to changes in the business and financial condition of, or demand for services by,\nsuch customers. During the year ended December 31, 2019, revenue attributable to these two customers accounted for, respectively, 30% and 23% of SpeedRoute and tZERO ATS, LLC's combined revenue. Additionally, to date, SpeedRoute and tZERO ATS, LLC account for tZERO's primary sources of revenue, making tZERO vulnerable to any changes in the business and financial condition of, or demand for SpeedRoute and tZERO ATS, LLC's services by such customers as well. SpeedRoute, tZERO ATS, LLC and tZERO's income and ability to meet its financial obligations could also be adversely affected in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or significant downturn in the business of one of these customers.\ntZERO has chosen to temporarily postpone commercialization of the DLR Software, and if it does resume commercialization, it may never successfully launch, market, or sell its DLR Software.\ntZERO has developed the DLR Software, which is intended to enable broker-dealer licensees with stock inventory to create a blockchain-based record of the shares that the licensee has made available for \"locates\" and of the daily purchases of the right to \"locate\" specifically identified shares for purposes of compliance with regulatory requirements. tZERO is temporarily postponing the further commercialization of the DLR Software as it focuses on other blockchain applications but may, in the future, resume commercialization thereof.\nIn the event tZERO were to recommence commercializing the DLR Software, its viability would be dependent on whether the DLR Software would be effective at satisfying regulatory obligations of those effecting short sales, which is currently uncertain. Confirming this regulatory compliance is the responsibility of broker-dealer licensees using the DLR Software, however, tZERO may be required to expend significant resources to assist licensees in doing so. Additionally, the existing system which the DLR Software is meant to replace is firmly entrenched and it would require the devotion of significant resources to persuade market participants to transition to the DLR Software. As a result, there can be no assurance that tZERO will choose to recommence commercialization of the DLR Software or that if it wishes to do so, that it will be successful in doing so, either due to the regulatory uncertainty relating to the DLR Software or due to a lack of sufficient resources available to tZERO at such time.\nStrategic transactions tZERO has and may engage in could disrupt its business, divert its management's attention or harm its business.\nFrom time to time tZERO has engaged in strategic transactions, including acquisitions, strategic investments and partnerships and divestitures, and may do so again in the future. Many of tZERO's businesses and the counterparties with which it may engage in transactions with are heavily regulated which may complexify such strategic transactions. The identification, evaluation, and negotiation of potential strategic transactions may divert the attention of management and require the incurrence of significant expenses, whether or not such transactions are ultimately completed. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from such transactions due to a number of factors, including difficulties resulting from the integration or separation of technologies, accounting or other operational systems, culture or personnel involved in any acquisition or divestment; diversion of management's attention; litigation; prioritization of resources; regulatory constraints or other disruptions to tZERO's operations. Also, the anticipated benefits of such strategic transactions may not materialize or increase tZERO's revenue. If any strategic transaction fails to meet tZERO's expectations, tZERO's business may be materially and adversely effected, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAdditional Risks Related to TZROP\nThe IRS may disagree with our characterization of the TZROP offering, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\nAlthough we have taken the position that the sale of TZROP in the TZROP offering was a sale of equity for tax purposes, if the IRS disagrees with our characterization and instead requires us to treat the proceeds as income to us for federal income tax purposes, this would reduce our federal net operating loss carryforwards by approximately $104.2 million as a result of the TZROP offering. In addition, if we are required to treat the proceeds of the security token offering as a liability rather than equity for accounting purposes, that would reduce tZERO's net book value compared to equity treatment, which might delay or prevent tZERO from declaring a dividend on the TZROP.\nWe are subject to the risks of holding TZROP and the risk that we will be unable to sell the TZROP.\nAs part of the TZROP offering, we elected to accept TZROP in payment of $30 million of tZERO's indebtedness to us. As an affiliate of the issuer, we may only resell the TZROP we hold under certain circumstances, and are therefore subject to all of the risks of holding TZROP, including the risk that we will be unable to resell any TZROP. We do not have any contractual\nrights to require tZERO or any third party to assist us in making such resales and as a result, expect to remain subject to the risks of holding TZROP for the foreseeable future.\nTZROP may be subject to registration under the Exchange Act if tZERO has assets above $10 million and more than a statutory number of registered token holders, which would increase tZERO's costs significantly and require substantial attention from tZERO's management.\nCompanies with total assets above $10 million and more than 2,000 holders of record of their equity securities, or 500 holders of record of its equity securities who are not accredited investors, at the end of their fiscal year must register the subject class of equity securities with the SEC under the Exchange Act. If tZERO is required to register TZROP with the SEC under the Exchange Act, it would be a laborious and expensive process and require a substantial portion of tZERO management's attention. Furthermore, if such registration takes place, tZERO would be subject to ongoing public reporting requirements and require additional accounting, tax, compliance, documentation, risk management and internal control procedures, necessitating the need for tZERO to hire additional personnel to implement, perform and/or monitor such procedures and creating materially higher compliance and reporting costs going forward.\nRisks Related to the Development of Digital Securities and the tZERO Technology Stack\nApplicable law and regulation may limit the extent to which blockchain technology may be used to enhance securities in the future, limiting tZERO's business.\nThe complex legal and regulatory requirements applicable to issuers and SEC-registered exchanges, alternative trading systems or other regulated venues and market participants currently limits the extent to which tZERO is able to further enhance securities using blockchain technology. For instance, regulators have emphasized the legal complexity raised by custodying securities on the blockchain and that it may not currently be regulatorily permissible in certain circumstances, regardless of whether tZERO is able to provide technology for this purpose. The ability of tZERO to provide additional applications of blockchain technology to digital securities or the financial industry more broadly may be dependent on legislators or regulatory authorities adopting additional rules and regulations or modifying existing rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, which may take significant time to occur and would be largely outside of tZERO's control. There can be no assurance that digital securities or any future legally and regulatorily compliant advancement thereof which tZERO may be able to develop will meet investor expectations-for example, there can be no assurance that it will enable less expensive or more efficient trading than is possible from other available trading solutions, whether traditional or otherwise.\nThe current user experience for digital securities, like TZROP and others traded on the tZERO ATS, is not analogous to one involving a virtual currency or any other anonymous bearer digital instrument that trades peer-to-peer on a distributed ledger because distributed ledger technology does not play a role in the sale, issuance, transfer or custody of digital securities. However, in the future regulatory authorities may take the position that the existing regulatory framework precludes the enhancement of digital securities with a digital \"courtesy carbon copy\". As a result, legal and regulatory developments could render the issuance and trading of digital securities impermissible or change the manner in which digital securities are permitted to be enhanced by blockchain technology.\nAny such regulatory issues may limit the commercial viability of tZERO's business, which would have a material adverse impact on tZERO's business and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRegulatory authorities may never permit the trading of certain digital securities or involvement by market participants in their trading or require changes to permit such trading to occur, limiting tZERO's businesses.\nDepending on the particular digital security and regulated trading venues on which a security would trade, numerous regulatory authorities, including FINRA and the SEC, may need to be consulted or provide their consent before any trading could occur. Any such regulatory authorities could prevent such trading from ever occurring if they objected to aspects of the anticipated method in which such trading would occur, including how the tZERO Technology Stack would be used and whether such regulated trading venues are permitted to trade digital securities. Applicable legal or regulatory requirements or authorities may also require changes to the manner in which such trading might occur before to permitting it to occur, which may require tZERO to make changes to the underlying technology for specific licensees or more broadly before trading may begin. The regulatory landscape that potential issuers and tZERO ATS and other regulated market participants involved in the trading of digital securities and their partners, need to navigate in order to successfully permit a digital security to begin trading is complex, and there can be no assurance that they will successfully do so. Assisting partners in addressing such considerations may require significant time and resources from tZERO both in navigating any legal and regulatory concerns or adapting the tZERO Technology Stack in a way that realizes the requirements of the particular digital security or regulated market participant.\nAny such regulatory issues may limit the commercial viability of tZERO's business, including the tZERO Technology Stack and regulated trading venues trading digital securities which tZERO has an interest in or its subsidiaries operate, which would have a material adverse impact on tZERO's business and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nDigital securities may not be widely adopted and may have limited users.\nIt is possible that digital securities will not be used by a large number of issuers or investors or tradeable on many regulated trading venues (or venues with sufficient market participants) or that there will be limited public interest in the continued creation and development of digital securities. Additionally, it is possible that other technology for the trading of securities which may or may not utilize blockchain technology will be developed or receive greater public interest, competing with or limiting demand for digital securities. Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the continued development and commercialization of the tZERO Technology Stack and the growth of the tZERO ATS trading ecosystem and have a material adverse effect on the business and financial position of tZERO and have a material adverse effect on us.\nSome market participants may oppose the development of blockchain-based systems like those central to tZERO's commercial mission, which could adversely affect tZERO.\nMany participants in the system currently used for trading public securities in the United States may oppose the development of capital markets systems and processes that involve the use of blockchain technology, whether by permitting trading to occur directly on the blockchain or by adding digital courtesy carbon copies such as those used by digital securities. The market participants who may oppose such a system may include entities with significantly greater resources, including financial resources and political influence, than tZERO or we have. The ability of tZERO to operate and achieve its commercial goals could be adversely affected by any actions of any such market participants that result in additional regulatory requirements or other activities that make it more difficult for tZERO to operate could adversely affect tZERO's ability to achieve its commercial goals, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisks Related to Blockchain Technology and the Blockchain Industry\nThe application of blockchain technologies to existing legal and regulatory regimes is uncertain, and new laws and regulations or policies may materially adversely affect tZERO's business.\nCertain of tZERO's businesses transact directly in peer-to-peer digital assets while others intend to advance existing industries by promoting the integration of blockchain technologies, either by creating technology to enable or investing in regulated venues to enable the issuance, trading, clearance and settlement of digital securities. The application of blockchain technologies to the legal and regulatory regimes applicable to these businesses, many of which were developed for earlier technologies, is often unclear and varies significantly among international, federal, state and local jurisdiction. Such legal and regulatory regimes are also likely to rapidly evolve as legislators and regulatory authorities take greater interest in blockchain technology.\nVarious legislative and executive bodies in the United States and in other countries may in the future adopt laws, regulations, or guidance, or take other actions, which may severely impact the adoption of blockchain technologies. Additionally, in the future, tZERO expects to evolve its focus towards the advancement of financial industry through the\nintegration of blockchain technology in new ways which may present novel questions of legal and regulatory interpretation. Failure by tZERO, its subsidiaries or any of their partners (including issuers of digital securities or market participants utilizing the tZERO Technology Stack) to comply with any laws, rules and regulations applicable to them, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines, the need to implement product changes, or an increase in costs related to compliance or operational changes and reputational harm, any of which could have a substantial and materially adverse effect to tZERO's business and us.\nThe further development and acceptance of blockchain technologies, which are part of a new and rapidly changing industry, are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of blockchain technologies, peer-to-peer digital assets and assets enhanced by blockchain technologies would have a material adverse effect on tZERO's business plans and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe growth of blockchain technology and the blockchain industry in general, as well as the specific blockchain networks which peer-to-peer digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and assets enhanced by blockchain technology, including digital securities such as TZROP, utilize, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The factors affecting the further development and acceptance of blockchain technology and the growth of the blockchain industry include, without limitation:\n\u2022\nworldwide growth in the adoption and use of peer-to-peer digital assets, assets enhanced by blockchain technology and other blockchain technologies;\n\u2022\ngovernment and quasi-government regulation of peer-to-peer digital assets and assets enhanced by blockchain technology and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of blockchain networks or similar systems;\n\u2022\nthe maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of blockchain networks;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;\n\u2022\nthe availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, or trading assets including new means of using government-backed currencies or existing networks;\n\u2022\nexploitable flaws inherent in blockchain technology (e.g. \"double-spend\" attacks or \"51%\" attacks);\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions affecting investment in and demand for peer-to-peer digital assets and assets enhanced by blockchain technology; and\n\u2022\na decline in the popularity or acceptance of peer-to-peer digital assets and assets enhanced by blockchain technology.\nThe blockchain industry as a whole has been characterized by rapid changes and innovations and are constantly evolving. Although it has experienced significant growth in recent years, the slowing or stopping of the development, general acceptance and adoption and usage of blockchain networks, peer-to-peer digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and assets enhanced by blockchain technology such as digital securities may materially adversely affect tZERO's business plans.\nThe prices of peer-to-peer digital assets and digital securities have historically been extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of individual assets could affect market perception of blockchain technology and thereby materially and adversely affect tZERO's business.\nThe prices of peer-to-peer digital assets, such as Bitcoin and Ether, and digital securities, including TZROP, have historically been subject to dramatic price fluctuations and are highly volatile. A fluctuation in the price of a single peer-to-peer digital asset or digital security may cause volatility in the value of such assets generally or a subset thereof. For example, a security breach that affects confidence and causes price fluctuations in Bitcoin or Ether may affect market perception of blockchain technology and may discourage potential investors from investing in or utilizing all peer-to-peer digital assets. Even though digital securities are conventional, uncertificated book-entry securities, investors may perceive them to be part of the same asset class as peer-to-peer digital assets due to their enhancement with a digital \"courtesy carbon copy\" of the transfer agent's share registry, and the price volatility of peer-to-peer digital assets may thereby affect investor perception of and demand for digital securities. This volatility may adversely affect interest in and demand for cryptocurrencies, such as those tZERO Crypto provides wallet and exchange services for, or digital securities which the tZERO Technology Stack is meant to enable and which trade on regulated venues tZERO invests in, each of which would materially adversely affect tZERO's business and us.\nAdditionally, tZERO Crypto holds a limited amount of cryptocurrency in an inventory to facilitate purchases and sales of cryptocurrency with its customers which have historically been subject to dramatic fluctuations and are highly volatile. This may subject tZERO Crypto to cryptocurrency price volatility risk which may materially adversely affect its financial condition.\nAdditional Risks Relating to our Retail Business\nOur business depends on the Internet, our infrastructure and transaction-processing systems.\nWe are completely dependent on our infrastructure and on the availability, reliability and security of the Internet and related systems. A substantial amount of our computer and communications hardware is located at a single Overstock owned and operated facility. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, acts of war, break-ins, earthquake and similar events. Our back-up facility is not adequate to support sales at a high level. Our servers and applications are vulnerable to malware, physical or electronic break-ins and other disruptions, the occurrence of any of which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data or the inability to accept and fulfill customer orders. Any system interruption that results in the unavailability of our Website or our mobile app or reduced performance of our transaction systems could interrupt or substantially reduce our ability to conduct our business. We have experienced periodic systems interruptions due to server failure, application failure, power failure and intentional cyber-attacks in the past, and may experience additional interruptions or failures in the future. Any failure or impairment of our infrastructure or of the availability of the Internet or related systems could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects. In addition, the occurrence of any event that would adversely affect e-commerce or discourage or prevent consumers from shopping online or via mobile apps could significantly decrease the volume of our retail sales.\nWe rely upon paid and unpaid natural search engines to rank our product offerings, and our financial results may suffer if we are unable to regain our prior rankings in natural searches.\nWe rely on paid and unpaid natural search engines to attract consumer interest in our product offerings, including Google, Bing, and Yahoo!. Changes to their ranking algorithms may further adversely affect our product offerings in paid and/or unpaid searches, and we may at times be subject to ranking penalties if the operators of search engines believe we are not in compliance with their guidelines. Search engine companies change their natural search engine algorithms periodically, and our ranking in natural searches may be adversely affected by those changes, as has occurred from time to time, and which have led us to pursue revenue growth in other more expensive marketing channels. Google's search engine is dominant in our business and has historically been a significant source of traffic to our website, much of it at essentially no incremental cost to us. Search engine companies may also determine that we are not in compliance with their guidelines from time to time, as has occurred in the past, and they may penalize us in their search algorithms as a result. In recent years, we have experienced declines in our rankings in Google's natural search engine, which has required us to utilize more expensive marketing channels or otherwise compensate for the loss of some of the natural search traffic. Any future declines in our rankings in Google's natural search engine could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business depends on effective marketing, including marketing via email and social networking messaging and our competitors have and may continue to directly increase our marketing costs and also have and may continue to cause us to decrease certain types of marketing.\nWe depend on effective marketing and high customer traffic. We depend on email to promote our site and offerings and to generate a substantial portion of our revenue. If a significant portion of our target customers no longer utilize email, or if we are unable to effectively and economically deliver email to our potential customers, whether for legal, regulatory or other reasons, it would have a material adverse effect on our business. We also rely on social networking messaging services for marketing purposes, and anything that limits our ability or our customers' ability or desire to utilize social networking services could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition to competing with us for customers, suppliers, and employees, our competitors have and may continue to directly increase our operating costs, by driving up the cost of various forms of online advertising. We may elect to decrease our use of sponsored search or other forms of marketing from time to time in order to decrease our costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business. We may also elect to spend additional amounts on sponsored search or other forms of marketing from time to time in order to increase traffic to our Website, or to take other actions to increase traffic and/or conversion. If we are unable to develop, improve, implement and maintain effective and efficient cost-effective advertising and marketing programs, it would have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks and risks of data loss or other security breaches.\nOur business involves the storage and transmission of users' proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, and to resulting claims, fines, and litigation. We have been subjected to a variety of cyber-attacks, which have increased in number and variety over time. We believe our systems are probed by potential hackers virtually 24/7, and we expect the problem will continue to grow worse over time. Cyber-attacks may target us,\nour customers, our suppliers, banks, credit card processors, delivery services, e-commerce in general or the communication infrastructure on which we depend. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business. Moreover, any insurance coverage we may carry may be inadequate to cover the expenses and other potential financial exposure we could face as a result of a cyber-attack or data breach.\nWe face intense competition and may not be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors.\nThe online retail market is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive. Barriers to entry are minimal, and current and new competitors can launch new websites at a relatively low cost. We currently compete with numerous competitors, including:\n\u2022\nonline retailers with or without discount departments, including Amazon.com, AliExpress (part of the Alibaba Group), eBay, and Rakuten.com (formerly Buy.com);\n\u2022\nonline shopping services, including Google Express;\n\u2022\nonline specialty retailers such as Blue Nile, Bluefly, Houzz, Jet.com, Wayfair, Zappos.com, and Zulily;\n\u2022\nfurniture specialists including Ashley Furniture, Bob's Discount Furniture, Havertys, Raymour & Flanigan and Rooms To Go;\n\u2022\ntraditional general merchandise and specialty retailers and liquidators including Barnes and Noble, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Best Buy, Costco, Crate and Barrel, Ethan Allen, Gilt, Home Depot, HomeGoods, Hudson's Bay Company, IKEA, J.C. Penney Company, Kirkland's, Kohl's, Lands' End, Lowe's, Macy's, Nordstrom, Pier 1 Imports, Pottery Barn, Restoration Hardware, Ross Stores, Saks Fifth Avenue, Sears, T.J. Maxx, Target, Wal-Mart, and Williams-Sonoma, all of which also have an online presence; and\n\u2022\nonline liquidators such as SmartBargains.\nWe expect that existing and future traditional manufacturers and retailers will continue to add or improve their e-commerce offerings, and that our existing and future e-commerce competitors, including Amazon, will continue to increase their offerings, their delivery capabilities, and the ways in which they enable shoppers to purchase goods, including their mobile technology and the voice-activated shopping services offered by Amazon. Further, large marketplace websites and sites which aggregate marketplace sellers with a large product selection are becoming increasingly popular, and we may not be able to place our products on these sites to take advantage of their internal search platforms and some shoppers may begin their searches at these websites rather than utilize traditional search engines at all. Many of our competitors specialize in one or more of the areas in which we offer products. For example, our furniture offerings compete with more than 100 online retail furniture websites, in addition to many more traditional furniture retail specialists. Some of our competitors run at net losses to gain market share in the online retail market. We also face competition from shopping services such as Google Express, which offers products from Walmart, Costco, Target and other retailers on a voice-activated shopping platform. Competition from Amazon and from other competitors, many of whom have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition, greater access to capital and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, affect us and have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nTariffs, the spread of illness, or other measures or events that increase the effective price of products or limit our ability to access products we or our suppliers or fulfillment partners import into the United States could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe and many of our suppliers and fulfillment partners source a large percentage of the products we offer on our Website from China and other countries. The United States imposed tariffs on goods from China in 2019 which adversely impacted our revenues. Further, the spread of the COVID-19 virus (also known as coronavirus) has been declared a \"pandemic\" by the World Health Organization. If the United States imposes additional tariffs, or if a disease or illness such as COVID-19 spreads and such measures or events directly or indirectly increase the price of imported products sold on our Website, or limit our ability to access products sold on our Website, the increased prices and/or supply chain challenges could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects. Further, the broader global effects of potentially reduced consumer confidence and spending related to COVID-19 could also have a negative effect on our overall business. At this point, the extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business is uncertain.\nThe spread of the COVID-19 could negatively impact our operations.\nWe have facilities located in Washington, New York, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Utah, and Ireland, and the employees working in those facilities may be at greater risk for exposure to and for contracting COVID-19. The U.S. Center for Disease Control, or the CDC, has reported known cases of COVID-19 in these states and country. The spread of COVID-19 in these locations may result in our employees being forced to work from home or missing work if they or a member of their family contract COVID-19. At this point, the extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business is uncertain.\nEconomic factors, including our increasing exposure to the U.S. housing industry and the potential for a decrease in consumer spending, could adversely affect us.\nEconomic conditions, particularly any weakness in the United States housing market, may adversely affect our financial performance. Over the last several years, the percentage of our sales from home and garden products has increased substantially. We believe that our sales of home and garden products are affected by the strength of the U.S. housing industry, and that downturns in the U.S. housing industry could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects. Similarly, a substantial portion of the products and services we offer are products or services that consumers may view as discretionary items rather than necessities. As a result, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macro-economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Difficult macro-economic conditions, particularly high levels of unemployment or underemployment, also impact our customers' ability to obtain consumer credit. Other factors, including consumer confidence, employment levels, interest rates, tax rates, consumer debt levels, and fuel and energy costs could reduce consumer spending or change consumer purchasing habits. Slowdowns in the U.S. or global economy, or an uncertain economic outlook, could materially adversely affect consumer spending habits and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nIf we do not successfully optimize and operate our warehouse, distribution centers and customer service operations, our business could be harmed.\nWe have expanded, contracted and otherwise modified our warehouse, distribution centers and customer service operations from time to time in the past, and expect that we will continue to do so. If we do not successfully optimize and operate our warehouse, distribution centers and customer service operations, it could significantly limit our ability to meet customer demand, customer shipping or return time expectations, or result in excessive costs and expenses for the size of our business. Because it is difficult to predict demand, we may not be able to manage our facilities in an optimal way, which may result in excess or insufficient inventory or warehousing capacity. We may also fail to staff our fulfillment and customer service centers at optimal levels. Our failure to manage our warehouse operations, distribution centers or our fulfillment and customer service centers optimally could adversely affect our financial results and customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe depend on third-party companies to perform functions critical to our business, and any failure on their part could have a material adverse effect our business.\nWe depend on third-party companies, including a large number of independent fulfillment partners whose products we offer for sale on our Website, to perform functions critical to our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. We depend on our fulfillment partners to perform traditional retail operations such as maintaining inventory, preparing merchandise for shipment to our customers and delivering purchased merchandise on a timely basis. We also depend on the delivery services that we and they utilize, on the payment processors that facilitate our customers' payments for their purchases, and on other third parties over which we have no control, for the operation of our business. Difficulties with any of our significant fulfillment partners, delivery services, payment processors or other third parties involved in our business, regardless of the reason, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe depend on our suppliers' and fulfillment partners' representations regarding product safety, content and quality, and for proper labelling of products.\nWe rely on our suppliers' and fulfillment partners' representations of product safety, content and quality. We also rely on our suppliers and partners to ensure proper labelling of products. Issues or concerns regarding product safety, labelling, content or quality could result in consumer or governmental claims and could adversely affect our financial results and business. Any indemnity agreement we may have with a supplier or partner of a product may be inadequate or inapplicable, and any insurance coverage we may carry may be inadequate. Even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds and management time and could have a negative impact on our business. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nOur decision to accept and hold cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, may subject us to exchange risk and additional tax and regulatory requirements.\nIn 2014, we began accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for purchases on our website. Neither bitcoin nor any of the other cryptocurrencies we may hold are considered legal tender or backed by any government, and bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies we may hold have experienced price volatility, technological glitches and various law enforcement and regulatory interventions. The use of cryptocurrency such as bitcoin has been prohibited or effectively prohibited in some countries. If we fail to comply with regulations or prohibitions applicable to us, we could face regulatory or other enforcement actions and potential fines and other consequences. Our Board of Directors has authorized us to retain, in bitcoin, up to 50% of our sales revenues paid for by customers in bitcoin. From time to time we hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly, and we have exchange rate risk on the amounts we hold as well as the risks that regulatory or other developments may adversely affect the value of the cryptocurrencies we hold. We may choose not to hedge or may be unable to fully hedge our exposure to cryptocurrencies and may at times be unable to convert cryptocurrencies to U.S. dollars. If any regulatory authority asserts that we require a license or other regulatory approval to conduct business or own an interest in other businesses involving cryptocurrencies, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.\nOur insurance coverage and indemnity rights may not adequately protect us against loss.\nThe types, coverage, or the amounts of any insurance coverage we may carry from time to time may not be adequate to compensate us for any losses we may actually incur in the operation of our business. Further, any insurance we may desire to purchase may not be available to us on terms we find acceptable or at all. We are not indemnified by all of our suppliers, and any indemnification rights we may have may not be enforceable or adequate to cover actual losses we may incur as a result of our sales of their products. Actual losses for which we are not insured or indemnified, or which exceed our insurance coverage or the capacity of our indemnitors or our ability to enforce our indemnity agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe are partially self-insured with respect to our employees' health insurance. If the actual costs of these claims exceed the amounts we have accrued for them, we would incur additional expense.\nBeginning January 1, 2017, we are partially self-insured with respect to our employees' health insurance, except to the extent of stop-loss coverage that limits our losses both on a per employee basis and an aggregate basis. The actual costs of our employees' health insurance claims could exceed our estimates of those costs for a number of reasons, including more claims or larger claims than we expect, and increases in the costs of healthcare generally. If the actual cost of our employees' health insurance claims and related expenses exceeds the amounts we have accrued, we may be required to record additional charges for these claims and/or to establish additional cash reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nAdditional Risks Relating to our Medici Business\nCertain equity financings completed by some of our subsidiaries could result in the acceleration of the vesting of outstanding equity awards granted by such subsidiaries.\nPursuant to equity incentive plans entered into by our subsidiaries, Medici Ventures, tZERO and Medici Land Governance, upon a \"change in control\" (as defined in the plans), outstanding equity awards that were issued under such plans would be subject to acceleration, vesting, and/or the lapsing of applicable restrictions on such awards. For purposes of the relevant tZERO plan, a \"change in control\" includes Overstock and any entity or entities directly or indirectly controlled by Overstock ceasing to be the legal or beneficial owner of a majority of the total voting power of the outstanding stock of tZERO. As a result, a sale of a number of shares by tZERO that would result in Overstock owning less than a majority of the total voting of the outstanding stock of tZERO would result in the acceleration of the vesting of the awards granted by tZERO. Further, the exercise of a sufficient number of outstanding equity awards issued under such plans could constitute a \"change of control\" as defined in such plan and thereby cause the accelerated vesting of unvested awards.\nOur subsidiary Medici Land Governance, Inc. is a public benefit corporation.\nOur subsidiary Medici Ventures has formed Medici Land Governance, Inc. (\"MLG\") as a public benefit corporation under Delaware law. Directors of traditional corporations, including Overstock and Medici Ventures, are required to make decisions they believe to be in the best interests of their stockholders. The directors of MLG are required by Delaware law to manage MLG in a manner that balances (1) MLG stockholders' pecuniary interests, (2) the best interests of those materially\naffected by MLG conduct, and (3) MLG public benefit purpose, which is to promote full financial inclusion, economic advancement, and enfranchisement of individuals, by creating systems using blockchain and other technologies that help individuals prove rightful ownership of assets, capitalize their assets, and establish a formal identity. As a result, MLG may not have the same focus on increasing stockholder value that Overstock and Medici Ventures have, and the duties of the officers and directors of MLG, some of whom also are or will be officers and/or directors of Overstock and/or Medici Ventures, may conflict with the duties of the officers and directors of Medici Ventures and Overstock. Even in the absence of common directors, conflicts of interest may arise.\nSubsidiaries of Medici Ventures, including Medici Land Governance, have emerging business models, without profits, and may require additional capital.\nSubsidiaries of Medici Ventures, including MLG, are in the early stages of their business and do not generate profits. Many of MLG's current projects are being done as pilot projects without charge, at MLG's expense, to demonstrate MLG's capabilities and develop its reputation. Although MLG intends to generate profits in the future, it has not done so to date. If subsidiaries of Medici Ventures, including MLG, cannot generate profits, such subsidiaries might require additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nThe businesses that we are pursuing through our Medici Ventures initiatives are novel and subject to technical, operational, financial, regulatory, legal, reputational and marketing risks.\nMedici Ventures has acquired interests in various businesses, including financial technology companies, broker-dealers, and digital currency transfer and payment businesses. We have limited experience with the operation of such businesses. Virtually every state in the U.S. regulates money transmitters and money service businesses. In some states the licensing requirements and regulations expressly cover companies engaged in digital currency activities; in other states it is not clear whether or how the existing laws and regulations apply to digital currency activities. Further, U.S. federal law requires registration of most such businesses with FinCEN. These licenses and registrations subject companies to various anti-money laundering, know-your-customer, record-keeping, reporting and capital and bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds, and inspection by state and federal regulatory agencies. Under U.S. federal law, it is a crime for a person, entity or business that is required to be registered with FinCEN or licensed in any state to fail to do so. Further, under U.S. federal law, anyone who owns all or part of an unlicensed money transmitting business may be subject to civil and criminal penalties. For example, if Bitt, Spera, Ripio, or FinClusive take any action that could subject them to registration with FinCEN or to licensing requirements in any state before they become properly licensed and registered, we could be subject to potential civil and criminal penalties. In addition, our majority-owned subsidiary tZERO is working on financial applications of blockchain technology, including the development and management of a trading platform for digital \"tokens,\" \"coins,\" and digital securities. See \"Additional Risks Relating to our tZERO Initiatives\" below. These areas, along with other areas, are areas in which we do not have substantial experience, and which are subject to the risks of new and novel businesses, including technical, operational, financial, regulatory, legal and reputational risks, as well as the risk that we may be unable to market, license or sell our technology successfully or profitably. The occurrence of any such risks, any such penalties, or even allegations of criminal or civil misconduct, could have a material adverse effect on us and on our financial results and business.\nWe may be required to write off amounts relating to our interests in startup businesses.\nAt December 31, 2019, Overstock and its subsidiaries held minority interests totaling approximately $52.4 million in several companies that are in the startup or development stages and we may acquire additional minority interests in other entities in the future. Minority interests are inherently risky because we may not have the ability to influence business decisions. Further, these interests are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. Additionally, since these interests are in companies that are in the early startup or development stages, even if their technology or products are viable, they may not be able to obtain the capital or resources necessary to successfully bring their technology or products to market. Furthermore, we have no assurance that the technology or products of companies we have funded would be successful, even if they were brought to market. We have written off amounts related to these interests in the past and may in the future write off additional amounts related to these interests. Any such write-offs could be material and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.\nIf we do not keep pace with technological and regulatory changes, it may impair our ability to market, license or sell the products and services developed as part of our Medici initiatives.\nThe market for products and services based on blockchain technology is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product and service innovation and evolving industry standards. The success of our Medici initiatives depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of such products and services, as well as\nour ability to comply with changing regulations and laws. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our competitiveness and financial results. In addition, we may need to continuously modify and enhance our offerings to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market in a timely fashion. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of products and services to keep pace with technological or regulatory changes or operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our products and services. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.\nThe blockchain related products and services that we are developing as part of our Medici initiatives have the potential to be used in ways we do not intend, including for criminal or other illegal activities.\nBlockchain related products and services, in particular cryptocurrencies, have the potential to be used for financial crimes or other illegal activities. Because the Medici initiatives are novel there are uncertainties regarding any legal and regulatory requirements for preventing blockchain related products and services from being put to such uses, and there are uncertainties regarding the liabilities and risks to the Company if we are unable to prevent such uses. Even if we comply with all laws and regulations regarding financial and blockchain related products and services, we have no ability to ensure that our customers, partners or others to whom we license or sell our products and services comply with all laws and regulations applicable to them and their transactions. Any negative publicity we receive regarding any allegations of unlawful uses of our Medici initiatives could damage our reputation. More generally, any negative publicity regarding unlawful uses of blockchain technology in the marketplace could reduce the demand for our products and services. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and Other Securities\nThe trading prices of our securities may be adversely affected by short-selling activities involving our common stock.\nThe trading prices of our common stock and other securities have been and may continue to be volatile. Our stock price fluctuations may be due in part to short-selling activity related to our common stock. The practice of short-selling activity may adversely affect our common stock price, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to raise capital and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nThe trading prices of our securities may be adversely affected by the pursuit of our strategic initiatives.\nThe trading prices of our common stock and other securities have been and may continue to be volatile. Our stock price fluctuations may be due in part to our disclosures about our exploration of strategic initiatives. Our stock price may be adversely affected by our future actions, including any decisions we may make or announcements to pursue or not to pursue such strategic initiatives, and by any announcements we may make regarding any such matters, any of which could cause the trading prices of our securities to decrease significantly which in turn could adversely affect our ability to raise capital and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nThe trading prices of our securities may be affected by the prices of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, despite our disclosures that we generally hold very little Bitcoin, and by perceptions regarding the business prospects of blockchain technology generally.\nThe trading prices of our securities may be affected by the prices of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, which may be the result of an apparent misperception that the value of our business is related to the value of Bitcoin, despite our disclosures that we generally hold very little Bitcoin. The market price of our securities may also be affected by perceptions regarding the business prospects of our Medici business and blockchain technology generally. To the extent that our blockchain initiatives do not succeed in a timely manner or at all, or the development or acceptance of blockchain networks, blockchain assets or blockchain applications slows or stops, the trading prices of our securities could decrease significantly, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to raise capital and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nSales by our significant stockholders could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common and preferred stock or subject us to limitations on our ability to use our net operating and tax credit carryforwards.\nA small number of our stockholders own a significant percentage of our common stock. In the past, our former executive officer and director Dr. Patrick Byrne owned a significant amount of our common stock that he sold in September of 2019, and which sale had an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and increased the risk that we may trigger a limitation on our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the future. According to public filings with the SEC, at December 31, 2019, a small number of institutional investors were beneficial owners of significant percentages of our common stock. Sales by any of such stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the market prices of our common stock and/or preferred stock. In addition, the transfer of ownership of a significant portion of our outstanding shares of common or preferred stock in the public market or otherwise, by us or by a significant stockholder, within a three-year period could adversely affect our ability to use our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable net income. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the holders of our securities.\nOur quarterly operating results are volatile and may adversely affect the market prices of our common stock and preferred stock, and you may lose all or a part of your investment.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our operating results in part because of seasonal fluctuations in traditional retail patterns. Our gross revenues have historically been significantly lower in the first and second calendar quarters than in the fourth quarter of the prior year due primarily to increased shopping activity during the fourth quarter holiday season. Further, we generally increase our inventories substantially in anticipation of holiday season shopping activity, which has a negative effect on our cash flow. As a result of the fourth quarter holiday season shopping, we also typically have unusually large payments due to our fulfillment partners in the first calendar quarter. Our revenues and operating results have varied in the past and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control. In addition to seasonal effects and the other risk factors described in this report, factors that have caused and/or could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate and in turn affect the market prices of our common stock and preferred stock include:\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of advertising and changes in our sales and marketing expenditures;\n\u2022\nexpenses we incur in our Medici and tZERO business development efforts;\n\u2022\nour inability to retain existing customers or encourage repeat purchases;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our existing and future marketing campaigns are successful;\n\u2022\nprice competition, particularly in the costs of marketing as well as in product pricing;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of our purchases of inventory;\n\u2022\nour inability to manage distribution operations or provide adequate levels of customer service;\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of fuel, transportation or distribution;\n\u2022\nour inability to implement technology changes or integrate operations and technologies from acquisitions or other business combinations;\n\u2022\nour efforts to offer new lines of products and services; and\n\u2022\nour inability to attract users to our website.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business and our ability to raise capital and could have a material adverse effect on the holders of our common stock and of our preferred stock.\nOur outstanding preferred stock could adversely affect the holders of our common stock in some circumstances.\nWe have two series of preferred stock outstanding. The preferred stock could adversely affect the holders of our common stock in some circumstances. The preferred stock generally votes with the common stock, with holders of the preferred stock having one vote for each share held. As of December 31, 2019, the 481,259 outstanding shares of preferred stock constituted approximately 1.2% of the total number of shares of the preferred stock and the common stock, taken together. Holders of the Series A-1 Preferred stock are entitled to an annual cash dividend of $0.16 per share, and holders of the Series B Preferred stock are entitled to an annual cash dividend at the annual rate of 1.0% multiplied by $15.68, in each case in preference to any dividend payment to the holders of the common stock, out of funds legally available for payment of dividends and subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. Holders of our preferred stock are also generally entitled to participate in any dividends we pay on the common stock. The preferred stock ranks equally with the common stock upon our liquidation, winding up or dissolution, with each share of Series A-1 Preferred stock and each share of Series B Preferred stock being treated as though it were a share of our common stock. Generally, in a business combination, we are obliged to use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause each share of the preferred stock to be treated as a share of common stock. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the holders of the common stock in connection with any such transactions.\nWe generally have not received significant coverage by securities analysts, and the lack of coverage may adversely affect our share price and trading volume.\nWe generally have not received significant coverage by securities analysts, and the securities analysts who do cover us may stop coverage at any time. The lack of coverage may adversely affect our share price and trading volume and may cause our share price or trading volume to be lower than they might be if more analysts covered us.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions which could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our Board of Directors. Among other things, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions:\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings;\n\u2022\nproviding that our Board of Directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nonly permitting the Board of Directors to fix the number of directors and to fill vacancies;\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of Board of Directors and stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\ndesignating a state court located in the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for specified matters.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law, which prevents certain stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding common stock not held by such 15% or greater stockholder.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock or other securities and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock or other securities.\nAdditional Risks Related Primarily to our Series A-1 Preferred Stock\nOur Series A-1 Preferred stock may only be sold through the tZERO ATS.\nThe amended and restated certificate of designation for the Series A-1 Preferred stock provides that shares of the Series A-1 Preferred stock can be sold only on the tZERO ATS. The Series A-1 Preferred stock is not and will not be listed on any national securities exchange or other trading market of any kind. The limitation on trading shares of Series A-1 Preferred stock through the tZERO ATS may adversely affect the liquidity for, and market price of, the shares of Series A-1 Preferred stock. It may at times be very difficult to sell any shares of the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nThe Series A-1 Preferred stock may only be sold through a brokerage account established with a broker-dealer that subscribes to and effects trading on the tZERO ATS. Currently, Dinosaur is the only broker-dealer that facilitates trades of any security on the tZERO ATS. Unless and until another broker-dealer effects trading on the tZERO ATS or maintains an account with an ATS-executing broker-dealer, any holder of Series A-1 Preferred stock that wishes to sell its shares must open an account at Dinosaur. While tZERO ATS, LLC is working to add additional broker-dealer effects trading on the tZERO ATS, there is no assurance that any executing broker-dealers will be added, and Dinosaur could continue to be the only ATS-executing broker-dealer. If Dinosaur for any reason ceases to operate, there would be no broker-dealer to effect sales of the Series A-1 Preferred stock on tZERO ATS. This could prevent all trading in the Series A-1 Preferred stock and would likely materially and adversely affect the trading prices of the Series A-1 Preferred stock. In such a case, however, the Board could exercise its authority to change or add additional alternative trading systems, trading markets or venues on which the Series A-1 Preferred stock may be sold.\nLikewise, Electronic Transaction Clearing, Inc., now doing business as Apex PRO (\"Apex\"), is the only broker-dealer that clears transactions effected on the tZERO ATS. If for any reason Apex ceases to clear trades for Dinosaur or refuses to clear trades for any future ATS-executing broker-dealers of tZERO ATS and no clearing firm succeeds Apex, trading in the Series A-1 Preferred stock on the tZERO ATS may be interrupted and such an interruption would likely materially and adversely affect the trading price of the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nThe tZERO ATS has had limited volume. Even if a more liquid trading market for the Series A-1 Preferred does develop on the tZERO ATS utilizing the tZERO Technology Stack or other technology developed by tZERO, the depth and liquidity of that market and the ability to sell the Series A-1 Preferred stock may nevertheless be limited, which may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity for, and the market price of, the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nMoreover, peer-to-peer transfers of the Series A-1 Preferred stock outside of orders submitted to the tZERO ATS by an ATS-executing broker-dealer, or with a broker-dealer that itself maintains an account with an ATS-subscribing broker-dealer, on behalf of its customers (\"peer-to-peer transfers\"), are not permitted, subject to limited circumstances. Computershare will register peer-to-peer transfers of record ownership of the Series A-1 Preferred stock in limited circumstances that do not constitute \"sales\" for purposes of securities laws, such as a transfer from broker-dealer to broker-dealer, with the stockholder's carrying broker-dealer being reflected as the record holder, or a transfer by a stockholder who is the record holder pursuant to a divorce decree, death or gift (and then only following compliance with Computershare's procedures, including delivery of appropriate documentation). However, the Board is authorized to exclude additional transactions or classes of transactions from the requirement to make \"sales\" on the tZERO ATS.\nThe restrictions on the tax reporting of holder's cost basis in shares of Series A-1 Preferred stock will not allow normal tax planning in the sale of shares of Series A-1 Preferred stock and may result in disadvantageous tax consequences to a seller of Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nOnly one method of cost basis reporting (the first-in, first-out, or \"FIFO\" method) is available for the Series A-1 Preferred stock. As a result, sellers of Series A-1 Preferred stock may be required to pay more tax on their sales or to pay taxes earlier than if other normal methods of cost basis reporting had been available, which could have an adverse tax effect on sellers of Series A-1 Preferred stock and the market price of the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nThe record of ownership of each digital wallet address will be available to the general public and it may be possible for members of the public to determine the identity of the record holders of the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nAlthough the record of ownership included in the blockchain is a non-controlling digital \"courtesy carbon copy\" of the records maintained by Computershare, it will be made publicly available. The publicly available information will include the digital wallet address of each holder of record transacting in Series A-1 Preferred stock and the security position information of such holder of record and the entire history of debits and credits to the relevant security position information of each digital\nwallet address, but it will not include any personal identifiable information. As a result, it may be possible for members of the public to determine the identity of the record holders of certain wallet addresses based on the publicly available information in the courtesy carbon copy, as well as other publicly available information, including any ownership reports required to be filed with the SEC regarding the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nThe Series A-1 Preferred stock depends on Computershare as the transfer agent for the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nComputershare serves as the transfer agent for the Series A-1 Preferred stock and ownership of the Series A-1 Preferred stock is determined by the books and records of Computershare. Our agreement with Computershare can be terminated by either party on 60 days' notice. If Computershare chooses to exercise its termination rights or otherwise ceases to operate as a transfer agent, we would seek to engage a successor transfer agent. In the absence of finding such a successor, Overstock would need to assume the role of transfer agent. While we believe we could successfully assume the role of transfer agent, no assurance can be given that we would be able to do so and if we are unable to do so the trading market for the Series A-1 Preferred stock would be adversely affected and it may be difficult or impossible for Overstock to pay dividends or liquidation preference or provide voting rights to the correct holders of record of the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nThe potential application of U.S. laws regarding traditional investment securities to the Series A-1 Preferred is unclear.\nWe believe that the Series A-1 Preferred stock should be treated as any other conventional, uncertificated book-entry security. However, various regulators may disagree with this assertion and conclude that the Series A-1 Preferred stock should not be treated as any other traditional investment security. For example, we believe that the Series A-1 Preferred stock is not a \"digital asset security\" within the meaning of the July 8, 2019 Joint Staff Statement on broker-dealer Custody of Digital Asset Securities (the \"July Statement\"), and that as a result, broker-dealers will have a good control location consistent with the July Statement. However, federal securities regulatory authorities may disagree with that conclusion and we could be required to take further steps with regulators to establish a good control location. The occurrence of any such issue or dispute could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity for, and market price of, the Series A-1 Preferred stock. In addition, if regulatory authorities take the position that Series A-1 Preferred stock is a \"digital asset security,\" then broker-dealers may need to submit a Form CMA with FINRA in order to hold the Series A-1 Preferred stock on your behalf, and that could prevent other broker-dealers from becoming executing broker-dealers to the tZERO ATS. As a result, holders of the Series A-1 Preferred stock may not be able to open an account with another ATS-executing broker-dealer authorized to facilitate trading of the Series A-1 Preferred stock on the tZERO ATS.\nIf we elect to repurchase the Series A-1 Preferred stock on the tZERO ATS, it could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity in, and trading prices of, the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nWe do not currently intend to repurchase any of the Series A-1 Preferred stock on the tZERO ATS. However, we could do so, subject to applicable regulations regarding issuer repurchases of their capital stock. If we do so, we would do so only at prices lower than the prices at which we are entitled to redeem the shares. If we repurchase shares of Series A-1 Preferred stock, the trading market for the Series A-1 Preferred stock could become less liquid, which would likely cause the trading prices of the Series A-1 Preferred stock to decrease, which would give us an economic incentive to repurchase additional shares. The occurrence of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity in, and trading prices of, the Series A-1 Preferred stock. There are no restrictions on our repurchase of shares of Series A-1 Preferred stock while there is any arrearage in the payment of dividends.\nWe may have the right to convert the outstanding shares of Series A-1 Preferred stock into shares of Series B Preferred stock at any time.\nPursuant to the amended and restated Series A-1 Preferred stock certificate of designation, we have the right to convert the Series A-1 Preferred stock into Series B Preferred stock at any time, and the terms of the Series B Preferred stock may be amended at any time without the consent of the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred stock. Currently, there are not enough authorized shares of Series B Preferred stock to permit conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred stock into Series B Preferred stock. In the future, the Board could seek stockholder approval to increase the authorized number of shares of preferred stock in an amount sufficient to permit the Board to increase the authorized shares of Series B Preferred stock to permit conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred stock into Series B Preferred stock, and then we would have the ability to exercise this conversion right. Any such conversion and any such amendment of the Series B Preferred stock could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the Series A-1 Preferred stock. If we were to do so at a time when the Series B Preferred stock were trading at a price lower than the trading price of the Series A-1 Preferred stock, holders of Series A-1 Preferred stock would likely experience an immediate and potentially material decrease in the market value of the Series A-1 Preferred stock they hold and\nof the Series B Preferred stock they would receive upon the conversion. Moreover, the existence of this conversion right could have a negative impact on the liquidity for, and market value of, our Series A-1 Preferred stock.\ntZERO ATS and tZERO are involved in ongoing discussions with regulatory authorities.\ntZERO ATS and tZERO have been and remain involved in ongoing oral and written communications with, and have received subpoenas from, regulatory authorities in connection with ongoing examinations, inquiries, or investigations. Any failure of tZERO ATS, LLC, the tZERO ATS, or tZERO to satisfy FINRA, the SEC, or any other regulatory authority could result in trading halts on the tZERO ATS and fines and penalties being imposed. Any such trading halt will adversely affect the trading market for the Series A-1 Preferred stock and may prevent the sale of Series A-1 Preferred stock until the failure is rectified.\nTechnology on which the tZERO ATS relies for its operations may not function properly.\nThe technology on which the tZERO ATS relies, including the tZERO Technology Stack, may not function properly because of internal problems or as a result of cyber-attacks or external security breaches. Any such malfunction may adversely affect the ability of holders with a brokerage account at a tZERO ATS subscriber to execute trades of the Series A-1 Preferred stock on the tZERO ATS. Moreover, since trading in the Series A-1 Preferred stock has been limited, the tZERO ATS platform may not function properly in cases of increased trading volume. If the technology used by the tZERO ATS does not work as anticipated, trading of the Series A-1 Preferred stock could be limited or even suspended. In such as case, however, our board of directors has the authority to change or add alternative trading systems, trading markets or venues on which the Series A-1 Preferred stock may be sold, but there can be no assurance that they will choose to do so in the future, or that any such additional trading venues would be found or prove suitable to support the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nThe technology on which the tZERO ATS depends has been developed by our indirectly held majority-owned subsidiary, tZERO, and is licensed to its wholly-owned subsidiary, tZERO ATS, LLC, and the Series A-1 Preferred stock depends on both tZERO and tZERO ATS, LLC, neither of which has substantial resources.\ntZERO is an indirectly held majority-owned subsidiary of ours and owns 100% of the equity interest in tZERO ATS, LLC. tZERO licenses the technology to tZERO ATS, LLC, and tZERO uses tZERO technology, including the tZERO Technology Stack, to operate the tZERO ATS. tZERO is a growth-stage company, and neither tZERO nor tZERO ATS, LLC has substantial resources. If any one or more of Overstock, tZERO or tZERO ATS, LLC were unable to fund its operations in the future, or if any one or more of them were to become the subject of a bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding, tZERO ATS, LLC might be unable to continue to operate the tZERO ATS, and the Series A-1 Preferred stock could be materially adversely affected. In any such event, or if the tZERO ATS, LLC or tZERO technology were to be unable to operate as intended for any reason, holders of our capital stock, including the Series A-1 Preferred stock, could lose their ability to trade our Series A-1 Preferred stock, which would have a material adverse effect on the market value of that stock, and may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity for, and the price of, our Common Stock.\nTransactions involving the Series A-1 Preferred stock may not be properly reflected on the blockchain.\nA significant feature of the Series A-1 Preferred stock is that, while the records of Computershare (as our transfer agent) govern record ownership of the Series A-1 Preferred stock, for all record holders on the transfer agent's official and controlling records there is a \"courtesy carbon copy\" of certain Computershare ownership records on the blockchain. Following Computershare's approval of any change in record ownership, the security position information relevant to a record holder's digital wallets addresses on the blockchain is updated consistent with changes to Computershare's official books and records. To the extent that Computershare's records and the \"courtesy carbon copy\" get out of sync, there could be a delay while we correct any such inconsistencies and such inconsistencies may cause investor confusion with respect to their record holdings of the Series A-1 Preferred stock, which could adversely affect the liquidity for, and market value of, the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nThe potential application of U.S. laws regarding virtual currencies and money transmission to tZERO ATS, LLC's use of the Ethereum blockchain is unclear.\nThe non-controlling blockchain-based \"courtesy carbon copy\" of record ownership uses tZERO technology, which, in turn, uses the Ethereum blockchain. Although tZERO's wholly owned subsidiary, tZERO Crypto maintains certain licenses in connection with its virtual currency applications, none of the parties involved in the operation of the tZERO ATS using tZERO technology is licensed under the virtual currency or money transmission regulations of any state in the United States or registered with FinCEN. If any regulatory authority were to assert that additional licensing or registration was required by tZERO ATS, LLC or tZERO, it could affect the operations or viability of either of them, and could adversely affect the availability of the tZERO ATS as a trading venue for the Series A-1 Preferred stock. This in turn would have a material adverse\neffect on the liquidity of the Series A-1 Preferred stock and the holders' ability to trade such securities. In addition, because tZERO ATS, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of tZERO, any negative impact on the value of the tZERO ATS or tZERO technology, including the tZERO Technology Stack, could have an adverse impact on the value of Overstock, which would cause our stock price to decrease.\nAlthough the Series A-1 Preferred stock has characteristics similar to those of our common stock, the differences may adversely affect the trading prices of the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nEach share of Series A-1 Preferred stock is intended to have voting and dividend rights and rights upon liquidation substantially similar to those of one share of our common stock, except that the Series A-1 Preferred stock will have a dividend preference over the common stock, the Series A-1 Preferred stock will be limited to trading on the tZERO ATS, and we will have the right to convert the Series A-1 Preferred stock into Series B Preferred stock. These provisions may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity for, and trading price of, the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nWe do not expect there to be any market makers to develop a trading market in the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nMost securities that are publicly traded in the United States have one or more broker-dealers acting as \"market makers\" for the security. A market maker is a firm that stands ready to buy and sell the security on a regular and continuous basis at publicly quoted prices. We have no assurances that the Series A-1 Preferred stock will ever have any market makers. We expect the lack of market makers to continue to contribute to a lack of liquidity in the Series A-1 Preferred stock, which could have a material adverse effect on holders' ability to trade them.\nAdditional Risks Related to both our Series A-1 Preferred stock and our Series B Preferred stock\nWe do not intend to issue any additional shares of Series B Preferred stock, which is expected to continue to result in very limited trading.\nWe do not intend to issue any additional shares of Series B Preferred stock. This will likely result in limited trading in the Series B Preferred and the number of shares of Series B is limited to 370,000.\nA share of Series A-1 Preferred stock and/or Series B Preferred stock may have a substantially lower market value than a share of our common stock.\nThe trading prices of the Series A-1 Preferred stock and the Series B Preferred stock have been at times, and may be in the future, substantially lower than the trading price of our common stock, which could have a material adverse effect on holders of Series A-1 Preferred stock and holders of Series B Preferred stock.\nIt is uncertain whether the IRS will treat the Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock as common stock or preferred stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nWe intend to treat the Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock as common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the IRS will treat the Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock as common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were not to treat either the Series A-1 Preferred stock or the Series B Preferred stock as common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it could have a material adverse effect on the holders of Series A-1 Preferred stock and the holders of Series B Preferred stock.\nHolders of Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock will have no rights with respect to our common stock.\nHolders of Series A-1 Preferred stock and holders of the Series B Preferred stock will have no rights with respect to our common stock, and no right to convert shares of Series A-1 Preferred stock or Series B Preferred stock into shares of common stock or to exchange shares of Series A-1 Preferred stock or Series B Preferred stock for shares of common stock, except that holders of Series A-1 Preferred stock and holders of Series B Preferred stock will have the right to vote with the common stock on any matter submitted to a vote of the holders of the common stock, the right to receive payments upon liquidation equally with the holders of the common stock, and the right to receive dividends in preference to the holders of the common stock and to participate in any dividend paid to the holders of our common stock, subject to the limitations set forth in the respective certificates of designation of Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock.\nOur obligation to pay dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock is limited, and our ability to pay dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock may be limited.\nOur obligation to pay preferential dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred stock is subject to our Board declaring such dividend payments. Further, although we will be contractually restricted from paying a dividend on the common stock unless we have paid preferential cumulative $0.16 per share annual dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred stock and preferential cumulative 1.0% annual dividends on the Series B Preferred stock, we have never paid a cash dividend on the common stock and we have no present intention of doing so. Consequently, our failure to pay preferential dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred stock and on the Series B Preferred stock might have no legal effect on us at all, although it could adversely affect the liquidity for, and trading prices of, the Series A-1 Preferred stock and of the Series B Preferred stock. Further, our payment of any dividends will be subject to contractual and legal restrictions and other factors our Board deems relevant. Further, we may elect not to pay dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred stock, the Series B Preferred stock or both rather than limiting other proposed expenditures, including expenditures that may not be contractually required. Moreover, agreements governing any future indebtedness of ours may further limit our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock, including the Series A-1 Preferred stock and the Series B Preferred stock. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by applicable law. Although there are no arrearages in cumulative preferred dividends and we declared and paid a cash dividend of $0.16 per share to the holders of our then outstanding preferred stock during 2017, 2018 and 2019, there is no assurance that we will be able or that our Board will decide to do so in 2020 or the future. Any of the foregoing facts or events could have a material adverse effect on the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred stock and the holders of the Series B Preferred stock and on the liquidity for, and trading prices of, the Series A-1 Preferred stock and the Series B Preferred stock.\nVoting rights on the Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock generally will be limited to voting together with the holders of the common stock and Series A Preferred stock or Series B Preferred stock as a single class, and the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred stock and the holders of the Series B Preferred stock collectively will have only a small percentage of the voting power on any matter submitted to the holders of the common stock, Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock, voting together as a single class.\nVoting rights of the Series A-1 Preferred stock or Series B Preferred stock generally will be limited to voting together with the holders of the common stock, Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock, as a single class. If an amendment requiring stockholder approval is proposed to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred stock and the holders of the Series B Preferred stock will vote together with the holders of the common stock as a single class, but neither the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred stock nor the holders of the Series B Preferred stock will be entitled to a class vote on the amendment, unless the proposed amendment would adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series A-1 Preferred stock or Series B Preferred stock, respectively increases or decreases of the authorized number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred stock or Series B Preferred stock, respectively. These limited voting rights could have a material adverse effect on holders of Series A-1 Preferred stock and holders of Series B Preferred stock and on the trading prices of the Series A-1 Preferred stock and the Series B Preferred stock.\nThe holders of the Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock will have no right as a separate class to elect any members of our board of directors under any circumstances, including upon any failure of our board of directors to declare or pay any dividend on the Series A-1 Preferred stock or Series B Preferred stock. Further, the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred stock and the holders of the Series B Preferred stock, together, also will have no right by themselves to elect any members of our board of directors under any circumstances. The holders of the Series A-1 Preferred stock and the holders of the Series B Preferred stock will be entitled only to vote with the holders of the common stock as a single class in the election of directors and on any other matter coming before a vote of the holders of the common stock. Holders' lack of such rights could have a material adverse effect on holders of the Series A-1 Preferred stock and the holders of the Series B Preferred stock and the liquidity for, and trading prices of, the Series A-1 Preferred stock and the Series B Preferred stock.\nThe Series A-1 Preferred stock and the Series B Preferred stock will rank junior to all of our and our subsidiaries' liabilities in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up of our or our subsidiaries' business.\nIn the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up, our assets will be available to make payments to holders of Series A-1 Preferred stock and to holders of Series B Preferred stock only after all of our liabilities have been paid, and neither the Series A-1 Preferred stock nor the Series B Preferred stock will have any preference over our common stock in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up. In addition, the Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock will rank structurally junior to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries. Holders' rights to participate in the assets of our subsidiaries upon any liquidation or reorganization of any subsidiary will rank junior to the claims of creditors. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up, there may not be sufficient assets remaining, after paying our and our subsidiaries' liabilities, to pay any amounts to the holders of Series A-1 Preferred stock or Series B Preferred stock then outstanding. We may\nincur significant debt or other liabilities in the future, and the Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock contain no covenant or restriction on our ability to incur debt or other obligations. Any bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up of our company or any of its wholly or partially owned subsidiaries would have a material adverse effect on the liquidity for, and trading prices of, the Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock.\nMoreover, we do not own all of the equity securities of our subsidiaries, including tZERO. For example, we have adopted an employee equity incentive plan pursuant to which tZERO has issued, and may continue to issue, shares or other equity interests or awards having the economic effects of equity interests to employees. As a result, following satisfaction of the claims of creditors of those subsidiaries as discussed above, our right to receive distributions as a stockholder with respect to our equity interests in those majority owned subsidiaries will be shared with third party equity holders of tZERO and our other subsidiaries, whether now existing or created in the future, including our employees holding shares of any of them.", "PERMNO": 89394, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "OSTK"}
