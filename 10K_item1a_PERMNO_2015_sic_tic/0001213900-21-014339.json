Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by a number of factors. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations, including causing our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. The following list of significant risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may materially adversely affect us in future periods. You should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic could harm the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 and related measures to contain its spread (such as government-mandated business closures and shelter-in-place guidelines) have created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. Although the COVID-19 pandemic and related measures to contain its spread have not adversely affected the Company\u2019s results of operations to date, they have adversely affected certain components of the Company\u2019s business, including by increasing cancellations (which can result in an increase in advertisement costs) and shipping times. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in the future will depend on numerous evolving factors that it cannot predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; any resurgence of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on national and global economic activity, unemployment levels and financial markets; the potential for shipping difficulties, including slowed deliveries to customers; the potential for increased cancellations by customers; and the ability of consumers to pay for products. Although consumer demand for and the inventory of the Company\u2019s products have remained stable, the COVID-19 pandemic has generally resulted in a decrease in consumer spending with respect to the wider economy, which in the future could have an adverse impact on the Company through reduced consumer demand for or inventory of its products. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused the Company to require employees to work remotely for an indefinite period of time, which could negatively impact its business and harm productivity and collaboration. If there is a prolonged impact of COVID-19, it could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, perhaps materially. The future impact of COVID-19 and these containment measures cannot be predicted with certainty and may increase the Company\u2019s borrowing costs, if any, and other costs of capital and otherwise adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the Company cannot assure that it will have access to external financing at times and on terms it considers acceptable, or at all, or that it will not experience other liquidity issues going forward.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business and Industry\nThe Company depends on search engines and other online sources to attract visitors to its digital commerce platform, and if the Company is unable to attract these visitors and convert them into customers in a cost-effective manner, its business and results of operations will be harmed.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on its ability to attract customers in a cost-effective manner. The Company\u2019s investments in marketing may not effectively reach potential consumers or those consumers may not decide to buy from it or the volume of consumers that purchase from it may not yield the intended return on investment. In order to drive traffic to its digital commerce platform, the Company relies on relationships with providers of online services, search engines, shopping comparison sites and marketplace sites to provide content, advertising banners and other links. In particular, the Company relies on Google as an important marketing channel, and if Google changes its algorithms or if competition increases for advertisements on Google or the Company\u2019s other marketing channels, the Company may be unable to cost-effectively attract customers to its products. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 51.1% of the Company\u2019s revenue was directly attributable to organic and paid traffic from Google.\nIn addition, many of the parties with whom the Company has online-advertising arrangements could provide advertising services to other companies, including retailers with whom the Company competes. As competition for online advertising has increased, the cost for these services has also increased. With the growing awareness of the importance of digital commerce channels, many of the Company\u2019s competitors are investing to acquire customers at a much higher cost and with a much lower profitability threshold, including through free shipping and other loss leaders. A significant increase in the cost of the marketing channels, including a change in the proportion of paid and free traffic upon which the Company relies, could adversely impact its ability to attract customers in a cost-effective manner and harm its business and results of operations. Further, while the Company uses promotions as a way to drive sales, these promotional activities may not drive sales and may adversely affect its gross margins.\nSimilarly, if any free search engine, price comparison and shopping engine, or marketplace site on which the Company relies begins charging fees for listing or placement, or if one or more of the search engines, price comparison and shopping engines, marketplace sites or other online sources on which the Company relies for purchased listings increases their fees, or modifies or terminates its relationship with the Company, including by restricting certain categories of products, the Company\u2019s expenses could rise, it could lose customers, and traffic to its digital commerce platform could decrease. Moreover, if the use of price comparison and shopping engines by consumers continues to increase in popularity, the Company may face increased pricing pressure or suffer reduced sales as consumers are more readily able to price compare among online shopping platforms.\nThe Company\u2019s recent growth rates may not be sustainable or indicative of its future growth.\nThe Company experienced significant growth in recent periods. This rate of growth may not be sustainable or indicative of the Company\u2019s future rate of growth. The Company believes that its continued growth will depend upon the success of its multiple initiatives and continuation of higher traffic and conversion rates, which primarily depend on (i) customer experiences, (ii) the economy and customers\u2019 disposable income, (iii) the Company\u2019s product offerings, product pricing and fulfillment, (iv) shipping speed and cost optimization, (v) the Company\u2019s competitive position in the aftermarket parts supply, (vi) changes in search engine algorithms affecting the Company\u2019s website\u2019s search engine optimization, and (vii) vendor supplies and vendor performance.\nIf the Company is unable to manage the challenges associated with its international operations, the growth of its business could be limited and its business could suffer.\nThe Company maintains international business operations in Ukraine, Belarus, the Philippines and Costa Rica. This international operation includes development and maintenance of the Company\u2019s websites and call center and back-office support services. The Company is subject to a number of risks and challenges that specifically relate to its international operations. The Company\u2019s international operations may not be successful if it is unable to meet and overcome these challenges, which could limit the growth of its business and may have an adverse effect on its business and operating results. These risks and challenges include:\n\u25cf difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations, including any impairment to its relationship with contractors, including the lead contractor of the Company\u2019s Ukraine operations, as well as service providers controlled by that lead contractor;\n\u25cf changes in operating costs charged by the Company\u2019s Ukrainian service providers, who are controlled by the Company\u2019s lead contractor in Ukraine;\n\u25cf increasing competition with respect to technology resources in Ukraine, leading to higher costs and higher attrition;\n\u25cf restrictions imposed by local labor practices and laws on its business and operations;\n\u25cf exposure to different business practices and legal standards;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf the imposition of government controls and restrictions;\n\u25cf political, social and economic instability and the risk of war, terrorist activities or other international incidents;\n\u25cf the failure of telecommunications and connectivity infrastructure;\n\u25cf natural disasters and public health emergencies, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u25cf potentially adverse tax consequences, including the possible imposition of increased withholding taxes or the re-classification of contractors as employees under local law.\nThe Company\u2019s growth strategy is dependent upon its ability to expand its \u201ciD\u201d branded store in industries outside automotive parts and accessories and to expand beyond its core DIY customer base into \u201cbusiness to business\u201d and DIFM customers.\nWhile the Company\u2019s digital commerce platform initially focused solely on automotive parts and accessories, management believes its platform is scalable. Accordingly, management believes that its application to other complex product portfolio industries, including the seven parts and accessories verticals launched in August 2018 under the \u201ciD\u201d brand (i.e., semi-truck, motorcycle, powersports, RV/camper, boating, recreation and tools), will continue to drive brand loyalty among customers and reputation among vendors and increase customer orders from adjacent markets. However, the Company can provide no assurance that this strategy will continue to be successful. In future periods, the Company\u2019s parts and accessories verticals may fail to attract new customers or appeal to the Company\u2019s existing customers of automotive products, or the customers of each vertical may be more segmented than the Company expects, thereby limiting its ability to develop cross-vertical brand loyalty. The Company may also struggle to populate its new verticals with a comprehensive assortment of products, which management believes is important to attract and retain customers. Additionally, within the automotive parts and accessories space, the Company\u2019s growth strategy is focused on expanding beyond its core DIY customer base by increasing business-to-business sales and sales to DIFM customers. These prospective customers may not be receptive to the Company\u2019s marketing efforts, product offerings, or current speed of fulfillment or shipping, or may remain committed to using their existing product vendors. If for these or other reasons the Company is unable to continue to execute its growth strategy, its results of operations and financial conditions could be adversely affected.\nPurchasers of aftermarket automotive parts and accessories may not choose to shop online, which would prevent the Company from acquiring new customers who are necessary to the growth of its business.\nThe online market for automotive parts and accessories is less developed than the online market for many other business and consumer products and currently represents only a small part of the overall automotive parts and accessories market. The Company\u2019s success will depend in part on its ability to attract new customers and to convert customers who have historically purchased automotive parts and accessories through traditional retail and wholesale operations. Specific factors that could discourage or prevent prospective customers from purchasing from the Company include:\n\u25cf concerns about buying automotive parts and accessories without face-to-face interaction with sales personnel;\n\u25cf the inability to physically handle, examine and compare products;\n\u25cf delivery time associated with internet orders;\n\u25cf concerns about the security of online transactions and the privacy of personal information;\n\u25cf delayed shipments or shipments of incorrect or damaged products;\n\u25cf increased shipping costs;\n\u25cf the inconvenience associated with returning or exchanging items purchased online; and\n\u25cf limited or no installation options or support for many products purchased online.\nIf the online market for automotive parts and accessories does not gain widespread acceptance, the Company\u2019s sales may decline and its business and financial results may suffer.\nIf demand for the Company\u2019s products slow, then its business may be materially adversely affected.\nDemand for the products the Company sells may be affected by a number of factors it cannot control, including:\n\u25cf the number of older vehicles in service. Vehicles seven years old or older are generally no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers\u2019 warranties and tend to need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles.\n\u25cf the economy. In periods of declining economic conditions, consumers may reduce their discretionary spending by deferring vehicle maintenance or repair. Additionally, such conditions may affect the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 ability to obtain credit. During periods of expansionary economic conditions, more of the Company\u2019s DIY customers may pay others to repair and maintain their vehicles instead of working on their own vehicles, or they may purchase new vehicles.\n\u25cf the weather. Milder weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automotive parts, while extended periods of rain and winter precipitation may cause the Company\u2019s customers to defer maintenance and repair on their vehicles. Further, drastic weather storms, such as hurricanes and winter storms, can have an immediate negative impact on the demand for the Company\u2019s products.\n\u25cf technological advances. Advances in automotive technology, such as electric vehicles, and parts design can result in cars needing maintenance less frequently and parts lasting longer.\n\u25cf the number of miles vehicles are driven annually. Higher vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair. Mileage levels may be affected by gas prices, ride sharing, the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions to slow its spread and other factors.\n\u25cf COVID-19 and the related increase in online shopping. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company\u2019s traffic and conversion rate increased substantially and its telephone calls to online traffic ratio decreased, each of which the Company\u2019s management attributes to the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions to slow its spread. The Company\u2019s financial projections assume its traffic and conversion rate will remain elevated going forward and its telephone calls to online traffic ratio will remain lower, so any reversal of these factors could cause the Company to fail to achieve its projections.\n\u25cf the quality of the vehicles manufactured by original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranties or maintenance offered on new vehicles.\n\u25cf restrictions on access to telematics and diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation. These restrictions may cause vehicle owners to rely on dealers to perform maintenance and repairs.\n\u25cf decreases in vehicle ownership due to wider adoption of on-demand transportation and ride sharing services.\nThese factors could result in a decline in the demand for the Company\u2019s products, which could adversely affect its business and overall financial condition.\nThe Company is dependent upon relationships with product vendors in Taiwan and China for the majority of its products.\nThe Company acquires a majority of its private label products, and its product vendors acquire a majority of their products, from manufacturers and distributors located in Taiwan and China. The Company does not have any long-term contracts or exclusive agreements with its foreign product vendors that would ensure its ability to acquire the types and quantities of products it desires at acceptable prices and in a timely manner or that would allow it to rely on customary indemnification protection with respect to any third-party claims similar to some of its U.S. product vendors.\nIn addition, because many of the Company\u2019s direct and indirect product vendors are outside of the United States, additional factors could interrupt its relationships or affect the Company\u2019s ability to acquire necessary products on acceptable terms, including:\n\u25cf political, social and economic instability and the risk of war or other international incidents in Asia or abroad;\n\u25cf fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may increase cost of products;\n\u25cf imposition of duties, taxes, tariffs or other charges on imports;\n\u25cf difficulties in complying with import and export laws, regulatory requirements and restrictions;\n\u25cf natural disasters and public health emergencies, such as COVID-19;\n\u25cf import shipping delays resulting from foreign or domestic labor shortages, slow-downs, or stoppages;\n\u25cf the failure of local laws to provide a sufficient degree of protection against infringement of its intellectual property;\n\u25cf imposition of new legislation relating to import quotas or other restrictions that may limit the quantity of its product that may be imported into the U.S. from countries or regions where it does business;\n\u25cf financial or political instability in any of the countries in which its products are manufactured;\n\u25cf potential recalls or cancellations of orders for any product that does not meet its quality standards;\n\u25cf disruption of imports by labor disputes or strikes and local business practices;\n\u25cf political or military conflict involving the United States or any country in which its product vendors are located, which could cause a delay in the transportation of its products, an increase in transportation costs and additional risk to product being damaged and delivered on time;\n\u25cf heightened terrorism security concerns, which could subject imported goods to additional, more frequent or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods;\n\u25cf inability of its non-U.S. product vendors to obtain adequate credit or access liquidity to finance their operations; and\n\u25cf its ability to enforce any agreements with its foreign product vendors.\nIf the Company were unable to import products from China and Taiwan in a cost-effective manner or at all, it could suffer irreparable harm to its business and be required to significantly curtail its operations, file for bankruptcy or cease operations.\nFrom time to time, the Company may also have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce its legal rights with foreign product vendors. However, it may be more difficult to evaluate the level of legal protection the Company enjoys in Taiwan and China and the corresponding outcome of any administrative or court proceedings than in comparison to its product vendors in the United States.\nThe Company depends on third-party delivery services to deliver products to its customers on a timely and consistent basis, and any deterioration in its relationship with any one of these third parties or increases in the fees that they charge could harm its reputation and adversely affect its business and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on third parties for the shipment of products, including a single carrier for the majority of its shipping needs, and it cannot be sure that these relationships will continue on terms favorable to it, or at all. Shipping costs have increased from time to time, and may continue to increase, and the Company may not be able to pass these costs directly to its customers. Any increased shipping costs could harm the Company\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations by increasing its costs of doing business and reducing gross margins, which could negatively affect its operating results. In addition, the Company utilizes a variety of shipping methods for outbound logistics. For outbound logistics, the Company relies on \u201cLess-than-Truckload,\u201d or LTL, and parcel freight based upon the product and quantities being shipped and customer delivery requirements. These outbound freight costs have increased on a year-over-year basis and may continue to increase in the future. The Company also ships a number of oversized automotive parts and accessories, which may trigger additional shipping costs by third-party delivery services. Any increases in fees or any increased use of LTL would increase the Company\u2019s shipping costs, which could negatively affect its operating results.\nIn addition, if the Company\u2019s relationships with these third parties, especially the single carrier the Company relies upon for the majority of its shipping needs, are terminated or impaired, or if these third parties are unable to deliver products for the Company, whether due to a labor shortage, slow down or stoppage, deteriorating financial or business conditions, responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, terrorist attacks or for any other reason, the Company would be required to use alternative carriers for the shipment of products to its customers. Changing carriers could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business and operating results due to reduced visibility of order status and package tracking and delays in order processing and product delivery, and it may be unable to engage alternative carriers on a timely basis, upon terms favorable to it, or at all.\nThe Company relies on bandwidth and data center providers and other third parties to provide products to its customers, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties could disrupt its business and cause it to lose customers.\nThe Company relies on third-party vendors, including data center and bandwidth providers. Any disruption in the network access or co-location services, which are the services that house and provide internet access to the Company\u2019s servers, provided by these third-party providers or any failure of these third-party providers to handle current or higher volumes of use could significantly harm the Company\u2019s business. Any financial or other difficulties the Company\u2019s providers face may have negative effects on the Company\u2019s business, the nature and extent of which cannot be predicted. The Company exercises little control over these third-party vendors, which increases its vulnerability to problems with the services they provide.\nThe Company also licenses technology from third parties, including software packages, ERP systems, system applications, hosting services, and related databases, to facilitate elements of its digital commerce platform, back-office support and accounting systems. The Company has experienced and expects to continue to experience interruptions and delays in service and availability for these elements. Any errors, failures, interruptions or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies could negatively impact the Company\u2019s relationship with its customers and adversely affect its business. The Company\u2019s systems also heavily depend on the availability of electricity, which also comes from third-party providers.. Information systems such as the Company\u2019s may be disrupted by even brief power outages, or by the fluctuations in power. This could disrupt the Company\u2019s business and cause it to lose customers.\nThe Company is highly dependent upon key product vendors.\nThe Company\u2019s top ten product vendors represented approximately 33.4% of its total revenue during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. The Company\u2019s ability to acquire products from its product vendors in amounts and on terms acceptable to it is dependent upon a number of factors that could affect its product vendors and which are beyond its control. For example, financial or operational difficulties that some of the Company\u2019s product vendors may face could result in an increase in the cost of the products the Company purchases from them. If the Company does not maintain its relationships with its existing product vendors or develop relationships with new product vendors on acceptable commercial terms, it may not be able to continue to offer a broad selection of merchandise at competitive prices and, as a result, it could lose customers and its sales could decline.\nThe Company outsources the distribution and fulfillment operation for most of the products it sells and is dependent on drop-ship product vendors to manage inventory, process orders and distribute those products to its customers in a timely manner. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, products shipped by drop-ship product vendors represented the vast majority of the Company\u2019s total revenue. Because the Company outsources a number of traditional retail functions to product vendors, it has limited control over how and when orders are fulfilled. The Company also has limited control over the products that its product vendors purchase or keep in stock. The Company\u2019s product vendors may not accurately forecast the products that will be in high demand or they may allocate popular products to other resellers, resulting in the unavailability of certain products for delivery to the Company\u2019s customers. Any inability to offer a broad array of products at competitive prices and any failure to deliver those products to the Company\u2019s customers in a timely and accurate manner may damage the Company\u2019s reputation and brand and could cause it to lose customers and its sales to decline.\nIn addition, the increasing consolidation among automotive parts and accessories product vendors may disrupt or end the Company\u2019s relationship with some product vendors, result in product shortages and/or lead to less competition and, consequently, higher prices. Furthermore, as part of its routine business, product vendors extend credit to the Company in connection with its purchase of their products. In the future, the Company\u2019s product vendors may limit the amount of credit they are willing to extend to the Company in connection with its purchase of their products, including as a result of the Company\u2019s public disclosure of its financial statements. If this were to occur, it could impair the Company\u2019s ability to acquire the types and quantities of products that it desires from the applicable product vendors on acceptable terms, severely impact its liquidity and capital resources, limit its ability to operate its business and could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is dependent on its product vendors to supply it with products that comply with safety and quality standards at competitive prices and to comply with the terms of their stated customer warranties.\nThe Company is dependent on its vendors continuing to supply quality products at favorable prices. If the Company\u2019s merchandise offerings do not meet its customers\u2019 expectations regarding safety and quality, it could experience lost sales, increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk. All of the Company\u2019s product vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws, and the Company is dependent on them to ensure that the products its customers buy comply with all safety and quality standards. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose the Company to government enforcement action and private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. To the extent the Company\u2019s product vendors are subject to additional governmental regulation of their product design and/or manufacturing processes, the cost of the merchandise it purchases may rise. In addition, negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products the Company sells could cause its customers to seek alternative sources for their needs, resulting in lost sales. In those circumstances, it may be difficult and costly for the Company to regain the confidence of its customers.\nThe Company is also dependent on its product vendors to comply with the terms of their stated customer product warranties. To the extent that the Company\u2019s product vendors fail to satisfy legitimate warranty claims asserted by the Company\u2019s customers, the Company may be directly responsible for reimbursing such customers, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations, particularly if one or more of the Company\u2019s larger product vendors fails to honor its warranty obligations.\nThe Company is dependent on entities controlled by a lead contractor in Ukraine to recruit and manage its development team and back-office support, as well to provide a physical facility to its contractors.\nBased on management\u2019s knowledge, the Company\u2019s lead contractor and his affiliate have sole authority to recruit and retain the Company\u2019s information technology subcontractors, and own the physical facility in Ukraine at which such subcontractors report to work. Because substantially all of the Company\u2019s information technology functions are performed in Ukraine, the Company is dependent on the lead contractor and his affiliate with respect to such functions. If these contractors or subcontractors fail to perform according to agreed-upon terms and timetables or terminate the arrangements under which they perform these functions, the Company may be unable to engage a substitute on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. This would likely result in temporary service disruptions and increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the Company fails to offer a broad selection of products at competitive prices or fails to locate sufficient inventory to meet customer demands, its revenue could decline.\nIn order to expand its business, the Company must successfully offer, on a continuous basis, a broad selection of automotive parts and accessories that meet the needs of its customers. Products sold by the Company are used by consumers for a variety of purposes, including repair, performance, improved aesthetics and functionality. In addition, to be successful, the Company\u2019s product offerings must be broad and deep in scope, competitively priced, well-made, innovative and attractive to a wide range of consumers. The Company cannot predict with certainty that it will be successful in offering products that meet all of these requirements. Moreover, even if the Company offers a broad selection of products at competitive prices, it must maintain access to sufficient inventory to meet consumer demand. If the Company\u2019s product offerings fail to satisfy its customers\u2019 requirements or respond to changes in customer preferences or if the Company otherwise fails to locate sufficient inventory to meet customer demands, its revenue could decline.\nShifting online consumer behavior regarding automotive parts and accessories could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial results and the growth of its business.\nShifting consumer behavior indicates that the Company\u2019s customers are becoming more inclined to shop for automotive parts and accessories through their mobile devices. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 49% of the Company\u2019s revenue and 64% of its traffic was attributable to mobile customers. Mobile customers exhibit different behaviors than more traditional desktop-based e-commerce customers. User sophistication and technological advances have increased consumer expectations around the user experience on mobile devices, including speed of response, functionality, product availability, security, and ease of use. If the Company is unable to continue to adapt its mobile device shopping experience in ways that improve its customers\u2019 mobile experience and increase the engagement of its mobile customers, the Company\u2019s sales may decline and its business and financial results may suffer.\nIf commodity prices such as fuel, plastic and steel increase, the Company\u2019s margins may be negatively impacted.\nIncreasing prices in the component materials for the parts the Company sells may impact the availability, the quality and the price of its products, as product vendors search for alternatives to existing materials and increase the prices they charge. The Company cannot ensure that it can recover all the increased costs through price increases, and its product vendors may not continue to provide a consistent quality of product as they may substitute lower cost materials to maintain pricing levels, all of which may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company faces intense competition and operates in an industry with limited barriers to entry, and some of its competitors may have greater resources than it and may be better positioned to capitalize on the growing online automotive aftermarket parts and accessories market.\nThe parts and accessories industries in which the Company sells its products are competitive and fragmented, and products are distributed through multi-tiered and overlapping channels. The Company competes with both online and offline sellers that offer parts and accessories, repair parts and original equipment manufacturer parts to either the DIY or the DIFM consumer segments. Current or potential competitors include (i) online retailers, including both niche retailers of uncommon, highly specialized products and general retailers of a larger number of broadly available products; (ii) national parts retailers such as Advance Auto Parts, AutoZone, NAPA and O\u2019Reilly Auto Parts; (iii) internet-based marketplaces such as Amazon.com and eBay.com; (iv) discount stores and mass merchandisers; (v) local independent retailers; (vi) wholesale parts distributors and (vii) manufacturers, product vendors and other distributors selling online directly to consumers.\nBarriers to entry are low, and current and new competitors can launch websites at a relatively low cost. Many of the Company\u2019s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing, technical, management and other resources than it does. For example, in the event that online marketplace companies such as Amazon or eBay, who have larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater resources than the Company does, focus more of their resources on competing in the automotive parts and accessories market, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have used and may continue to use aggressive pricing tactics and devote substantially more financial resources to website and system development than the Company does. The Company expects that competition will further intensify in the future as internet use and online commerce continue to grow worldwide. Increased competition may result in reduced sales, lower operating margins, reduced profitability, loss of market share and diminished brand recognition.\nAdditionally, the Company has experienced significant competitive pressure from certain of its product vendors who are now selling their products directly to customers. Since the Company\u2019s product vendors have access to merchandise at very low costs, they can sell products at lower prices and maintain higher gross margins on their product sales than the Company can. The Company\u2019s financial results have been negatively impacted by direct sales from its product vendors to its current and potential customers, and the Company\u2019s total number of orders and average order value may decline due to increased competition. Continued competition from the Company\u2019s product vendors may also continue to negatively impact its business and results of operations, including through reduced sales, lower operating margins, reduced profitability, loss of market share and diminished brand recognition. The Company has implemented and will continue to implement several strategies to attempt to overcome the challenges created by its product vendors selling directly to its customers and potential customers, including optimizing its pricing, continuing to increase its mix of private label products and improving its diligence commerce platform, which may not be successful. If these strategies are not successful, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company relies on key personnel and may need additional personnel for the success and growth of its business.\nThe Company\u2019s business is largely dependent on the personal efforts and abilities of highly skilled executive, technical, managerial, merchandising, marketing, and call center personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and the Company cannot assure that it will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. The loss of any key employee or the Company\u2019s inability to attract or retain other qualified employees could harm its business and results of operations.\nThe Company generates a portion of its revenue from advertising, and reduced spending by advertisers or new and existing technologies that block ads online could harm its business.\nThe Company generates a portion of its revenue from the display of ads online. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Adverse macroeconomic conditions can have a material adverse effect on the demand for advertising and cause the Company\u2019s advertisers to reduce the amounts they spend on advertising, which could harm the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges to the automotive industry and consumer views on vehicle ownership could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe automotive industry is predicted to experience rapid change in the years to come, including increases in ride-sharing services, advances in electric vehicle production and driverless technology. Ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft provide consumers with mobility options outside of traditional vehicle ownership. Manufacturers also continue to invest in increasing production and quality of battery-electric vehicles, which generally require less maintenance than traditional cars and trucks and may be more difficult for DIY customers to repair. Technological advances are also facilitating the development of driverless vehicles, which may further reduce the need for vehicle ownership. If sales of automotive parts and accessories decline as a result of these or other changes to the automotive industry, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Finances\nThe Company has a history of losses.\nThe Company has a history of low operating margins and losses. The Company continues to focus on growing its business in the near term, with increasing investments in its business, which may result in the incurrence of additional losses. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had net income of $2.1 million before a cash and non-cash deemed distribution to preferred stockholders (and after such distribution, a net loss of $13.3 million available to common stockholders), compared to a net loss of $0.7 million (and a net loss of $1.2 million available to common stockholders) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. If the Company incurs substantial net losses in the future, it could impact the Company\u2019s liquidity, as it may not be able to provide positive cash flows from operations in order to meet its working capital requirements. The Company may need to sell additional assets or seek additional equity or additional debt financing in the future. In such case, there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to raise such additional financing or engage in such asset sales on acceptable terms, or at all. If the Company\u2019s net losses were to continue, and if the Company is not able to raise adequate additional financing or proceeds from asset sales to continue to fund its ongoing operations, it will need to defer, reduce or eliminate significant planned expenditures, restructure or significantly curtail its operations, file for bankruptcy or cease operations.\nThe Company may not generate sufficient cash flows to cover its operating expenses, and any failure to obtain additional capital could jeopardize its operations and the cost of capital may be high.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had negative working capital of approximately $25.8 million. In the event that the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash from its operating activities or obtain financing, it could be required to delay, reduce or discontinue its operations and ongoing business efforts. Further, if for any reason, the revenues of the Company decline or there are unfavorable changes in the credit terms from its key product vendors, it could have an adverse impact on the availability of working capital to the Company. Even if the Company is able to raise capital, it may raise capital by selling equity securities, which will be dilutive to existing stockholders. If the Company incurs indebtedness, costs of financing may be extremely high, and the Company will be subject to default risks associated with such indebtedness, which may harm its ability to continue its operations.\nChanges in customer, product, vendor or sourcing sales mix could cause the Company\u2019s gross margin and ultimately operating margins to decline; failure to mitigate these pressures could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s gross margins are dependent on the mix of products it sells, decisions to drop-ship rather than stock products in its distribution centers, decisions to offer private label alternatives or branded offerings, price changes by its vendors, pricing actions by competitors, and the mix of paid and organic traffic to its e-commerce platform. In addition, the Company\u2019s margin could be adversely affected by any consumer shift away from its private label products.\nWe may be unable to accurately forecast net sales and appropriately plan our expenses in the future.\nNet sales and results of operations are difficult to forecast because they generally depend on the volume, timing and type of orders we receive, all of which are uncertain. We base our expense levels and investment plans on our estimates of net sales and gross margins. We cannot be sure the same growth rates, trends, and other key performance metrics are meaningful predictors of future growth. If our assumptions prove to be wrong, we may spend more than we anticipate acquiring and retaining customers or may generate lower net sales per active customer than anticipated, either of which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Regulation and Tax\nRegulation in the areas of privacy and protection of user data could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of personally identifiable information about its users around the world. Much of the personal information that the Company collects, especially customer identity and financial information, is regulated by multiple laws. User data protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country. These laws continue to develop in ways the Company cannot predict and that may harm its business.\nRegulatory scrutiny of privacy, user data protection, use of data and data collection is increasing on a global basis. The Company is subject to a number of privacy and similar laws and regulations in the countries in which it operates, and these laws and regulations will likely continue to evolve over time, both through regulatory and legislative action and judicial decisions. In addition, compliance with these laws may restrict the Company\u2019s ability to provide services to its customers that they may find to be valuable. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) applies to all of the Company\u2019s activities conducted from an establishment in the European Union or related to products and services offered in the European Union, and impose significant compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. If the Company fails to comply with the GDPR, or if regulators assert the Company has failed to comply with the GDPR, it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue, private lawsuits, or reputational damage. In the United States, California has adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective January 1, 2020 and which provides a private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. Moreover, on November 3, 2020, Californians voted to approve a ballot measure that created the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), which amends and expands the rights and obligations under the CCPA. Most of the CPRA\u2019s substantive provisions will not take effect until January 1, 2023. Once the CPRA takes effect, it will replace the CCPA, although in the interim, businesses must comply with the CCPA. In addition to the CCPA and CPRA, several other U.S. states have or are considering adopting laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the handling of personal data. Compliance with the GDPR, the CCPA, the CPRA and other current and future applicable international and U.S. privacy, cybersecurity and related laws can be costly and time-consuming. Complying with these varying national and international requirements could cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require it to change its business practices in a manner adverse to its business, and violations of privacy-related laws can result in significant penalties.\nA determination that there have been violations of laws relating to the Company\u2019s practices under communications-based laws could also expose it to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm its business. In particular, because of the enormous number of emails and other communications the Company sends to its users, communications laws that provide a specified monetary damage award or fine for each violation (such as those described below) could result in particularly large awards or fines.\nFor example, the Federal Communications Commission amended certain of its regulations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, in 2012 and 2013 in a manner that could increase the Company\u2019s exposure to liability for certain types of telephonic communication with customers. Under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. Given the enormous number of communications the Company sends to its users, a determination that there have been violations of the TCPA or other communications-based statutes could expose the Company to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm its business.\nThe Company posts on its websites its privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to comply with its posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other federal, state or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regulations, including the GDPR and the CCPA, could result in proceedings or actions against it by governmental entities or others (e.g., class action privacy litigation), subject it to significant penalties and negative publicity, require it to change its business practices, increase its costs and adversely affect its business. Data collection, privacy and security have become the subject of increasing public concern. If internet and mobile users were to reduce their use of the Company\u2019s websites, mobile platforms, products, and services as a result of these concerns, its business could be harmed. As noted above, the Company is subject to the possibility of security breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws.\nThe Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of its business, which may affect the way the Company conducts its operations.\nThe Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of its business, including those governing the use and transportation of hazardous substances and emissions-related standards, established by the EPA, and similar state-level regulators, including CARB.\nWhile the Company has processes in place to ensure that products are sold in compliance with the requirements imposed by the EPA and similar state-level regulators, all verification processes have inherent limitations. The Company has been, is currently, and may in the future be the subject of regulatory proceedings initiated by the EPA, CARB or other applicable regulatory bodies, and the results of such proceedings are uncertain. For additional information, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAlthough management believes that the Company is in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental laws, rules, and regulations, it is unable to predict the ultimate impact of adopted or future laws, rules, and regulations on its business, properties or products. Such laws, rules, or regulations may cause the Company to incur significant expenses to achieve or maintain compliance, may require it to modify its product offerings, may adversely affect the price of or demand for some of its products, and may ultimately affect the way the Company conducts its operations. Failure to comply with these current or future laws, rules, or regulations could result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation and/or could lead to fines and other penalties, including restrictions on the importation of the Company\u2019s products into, or the sale of its products in, one or more jurisdictions until compliance is achieved.\nThe Company could be required to collect additional sales taxes or be subject to other tax liabilities that may increase the costs its customers would have to pay for its products and adversely affect its operating results.\nIn general, the Company has not historically collected state or local sales, use, or other similar taxes in any jurisdictions in which it believed it did not have a tax nexus. In addition, the Company has not historically collected state or local sales, use, or other similar taxes in certain jurisdictions in which it does have a physical presence, in reliance on applicable exemptions. On June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court decided, in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., that state and local jurisdictions may, at least in certain circumstances, enforce a sales and use tax collection obligation on remote vendors that have no physical presence in such jurisdiction. A number of states have begun, or have positioned themselves to begin, requiring sales and use tax collection by remote vendors and/or by online marketplaces. The details and effective dates of these collection requirements vary from state to state. While we believe we now collect, remit, and report sales tax in all required states, it is still possible that one or more jurisdictions may assert that we have liability for previous periods for which we did not collect sales, use, or other similar taxes, and if such an assertion or assertions were successful it could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales taxes and penalties and interest, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nCertain U.S. state tax authorities could assert that the Company has nexus in that state and seek to impose state and local income taxes which could harm its results of operations.\nFor the tax year ending December 31, 2019, and for years prior thereto, the Company filed state income tax returns in New Jersey. There is a risk that state tax authorities in other states could assert that the Company is liable for state and local income taxes based upon income or gross receipts allocable to such states because the Company has nexus with those states. The Company could then be subject to state and local taxation in other states, in lieu of or in addition to, taxation in New Jersey. Penalties and interest could apply to unpaid tax attributable to prior periods. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest may adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Cybersecurity\nAny failure to maintain the security of the information relating to the Company\u2019s customers, employees and vendors, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on its information systems or otherwise, could damage its reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against it, cause it to incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect its business and results of operations.\nLike most retailers, the Company receives and stores in its information systems personal information about its customers, employees and vendors. Most of this information is stored digitally in connection with the Company\u2019s digital commerce platform. The Company also utilizes third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for digital storage technology, back-office support, and other functions. Such providers may have access to information the Company holds about its customers, employees or vendors. In addition, the Company depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.\nCyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber threats and cyber-attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of hackers with a wide range of motives and expertise. The Company and the businesses with which it interacts have experienced and continue to experience threats to data and systems, including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card information, and cause system failures and disruptions. Some of the Company\u2019s systems have experienced security breaches in the past, and there can be no assurance that similar breaches will not recur in the future.\nEmployee error or malfeasance, faulty password management, social engineering or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of the Company or its third-party service providers\u2019 security measures and a breach of its or their information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications the Company uses may have inherent vulnerabilities or defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security.\nAny compromise of the Company\u2019s data security systems or of those of businesses with which it interacts, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, modified, lost or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and expose it to regulatory actions, customer attrition, remediation expenses, and claims from customers, employees, vendors, financial institutions, payment card networks and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business operations, financial condition and results of operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures, and the Company or its third-party service providers may not discover any security breach, vulnerability or compromise of information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs.\nIn addition, such events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation with its customers, employees, vendors and stockholders, could harm its competitive position with respect to other digital commerce websites, and could result in a material reduction in net sales from its digital commerce platform. Such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about the Company\u2019s operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against the Company or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by its insurance policies. Moreover, a security compromise could require the Company to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the issue and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures it employs to guard personal and confidential information against cyber-attacks and other attempts to access or otherwise compromise such information and could result in a disruption of its operations.\nThe Company accepts payments using a variety of methods, including credit and debit cards, online payment systems such as PayPal, Google Pay, Affirm and gift cards, and it may offer new payment options over time. As an online retailer, the Company is reliant upon third-party payment processors to sell its products, and any interruption to the services provided by such payment processors, including as a result of payment disputes, would have an immediate impact on the Company\u2019s cash flows, financial position and results of operations. Third-party payment processors may also increase their fees or increase the minimum reserves on the Company\u2019s accounts, which could decrease the Company\u2019s profit margin and impair the Company\u2019s liquidity, respectively.\nAs a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, the Company also is subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. The Company cannot be certain that the security measures it maintains to protect all of its information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect cyber-attacks, cyber terrorism, security breaches or other compromises from known malware or other threats that may be developed in the future. To the extent that any cyber-attack or incursion in the Company or one of its third-party service provider\u2019s information systems results in the loss, damage, misappropriation or other compromise of information, the Company may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. In certain circumstances, the Company\u2019s contracts with payment card processors and payment card networks (such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover) generally require the Company to adhere to payment card network rules, which could make it liable to payment card issuers and others if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that it processes is compromised or if the Company permits fraudulent purchases on its platform, which liabilities could be substantial. If the event of a material increase in fraudulent purchases on the Company\u2019s platform, payment card processors and payment card networks could refuse to process further payments for purchases on the Company\u2019s platform, which would materially impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nIf the Company\u2019s proprietary data catalog is stolen, misappropriated or damaged, or if a competitor is able to create a substantially similar database without infringing the Company\u2019s rights, then the Company may lose an important competitive advantage.\nThe Company has invested significant resources and time to build and maintain its proprietary data catalog, which maps stock-keeping units, to relevant product applications based on vehicle years, makes, and models. Management believes that the Company\u2019s data catalog provides it with an important competitive advantage in both driving traffic to its digital commerce platform and converting that traffic to revenue by enabling customers to quickly locate the parts and accessories they require. The Company cannot assure you that it will be able to protect its data catalog from unauthorized copying or theft or that such database will continue to operate adequately, without any technological challenges. In addition, it is possible that a competitor could develop a catalog or database that is similar to or more comprehensive than the Company\u2019s data catalog, without infringing the Company\u2019s rights. In the event its data catalog is damaged or is stolen, copied or otherwise replicated to compete with the Company, whether lawfully or not, the Company may lose an important competitive advantage and its business could be harmed.\nClaims of intellectual property infringement by parts manufacturers, distributors or retailers to the validity of aftermarket parts and accessories or related marketing materials could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nParts manufacturers, distributors and retailers have asserted claims of intellectual property infringement against retailers of aftermarket products, including the Company. The Company has received in the past, and anticipates receiving in the future, communications alleging that certain products it sells infringe the patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade names or other intellectual property rights of parts manufacturers, distributors or retailers. Other parts retailers have also asserted ownership of product images that were provided by product vendors for the Company to use on its online platform. While the Company now has processes in place to prevent the use of unauthorized product images on its platform, there can be no assurance that such processes will work as intended or prevent future infringement claims.\nInfringement claims could result in increased costs of doing business arising from new importing requirements, increased port and carrier fees and legal expenses, adverse judgments or settlements or changes to the Company\u2019s business practices required to settle such claims or satisfy any judgments. Litigation or regulatory enforcement could also result in interpretations of the law that require the Company to change its business practices or otherwise increase its costs and harm its business. The Company may not maintain sufficient, or any, insurance coverage to cover the types of claims that could be asserted. If a successful claim were brought against the Company, it could expose the Company to significant liability.\nIf the Company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights, its reputation and brand could be impaired and it could lose customers.\nThe Company regards its trademarks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property such as its \u201ciD\u201d brand, its proprietary digital commerce platform, its proprietary data catalog and its back-end order processing and fulfillment code and process as important to its success. The Company relies on trademark, patent and copyright law, and trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with employees, customers, partners and others to protect its proprietary rights. The Company cannot be certain that it has taken adequate steps to protect its proprietary rights, especially in countries where the laws may not protect its rights as fully as in the United States. In addition, the Company\u2019s proprietary rights may be infringed or misappropriated, and the Company could be required to incur significant expenses in its efforts to preserve them. In the past, the Company has filed litigation to protect its intellectual property rights, including its \u201ciD\u201d brand. The outcome of such litigation can be uncertain, and the cost of prosecuting such litigation may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s earnings. The Company has common law trademarks, as well as pending federal trademark registrations for several marks and several registered marks. However, any registrations may not adequately cover the Company\u2019s intellectual property or protect it against infringement by others. Effective trademark, service mark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which the Company\u2019s products may be made available online. The Company also currently owns or controls a number of internet domain names, including www.carid.com, www.truckid.com, www.motorcycleid.com, www.powersportsid.com, www.camperid.com, www.boatid.com, www.recreationid.com and www.toolsid.com, and has invested time and money in the purchase of domain names and other intellectual property, which may be impaired if it cannot protect such intellectual property. The Company may be unable to protect these domain names or acquire or maintain relevant domain names in the United States and in other countries. If the Company is not able to protect its trademarks, domain names or other intellectual property, it may experience difficulties in achieving and maintaining brand recognition and customer loyalty.\nThe Company\u2019s digital commerce platform is dependent on open-source software, which exposes it to uncertainty and potential liability.\nThe Company utilizes open-source software such as Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl throughout its digital commerce platform and supporting infrastructure, although it has created proprietary programs. Open-source software is maintained and upgraded by a general community of software developers under various open-source licenses, including the GNU General Public License (\u201cGPL\u201d). These developers are under no obligation to maintain, enhance or provide any fixes or updates to this software in the future. Additionally, under the terms of the GPL and other open-source licenses, the Company may be forced to release to the public source-code internally developed by it pursuant to such licenses. Furthermore, if any of these developers contribute any code of others to any of the software that the Company uses, the Company may be exposed to claims and liability for intellectual property infringement and may also be forced to implement changes to the code-base for this software or replace this software with internally developed or commercially licensed software.\nSystem failures, including failures due to natural disasters or other catastrophic events, could prevent access to the Company\u2019s digital commerce platform, which could reduce its net sales and harm its reputation.\nThe Company\u2019s sales would decline and it could lose existing or potential customers if it is not able to access its digital commerce platform or if its digital commerce platform, transactions processing systems or network infrastructure do not perform to its customers\u2019 satisfaction. Any internet network interruptions or problems with the Company\u2019s digital commerce platform could:\n\u25cf prevent customers from accessing such digital commerce platform;\n\u25cf reduce its ability to fulfill orders or bill customers;\n\u25cf reduce the number of products that it sells;\n\u25cf cause customer dissatisfaction; or\n\u25cf damage its brand and reputation.\nThe Company has experienced brief computer system interruptions in the past, and it believes they may continue to occur from time to time in the future. The Company\u2019s systems and operations are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from a number of sources, including a natural disaster or other catastrophic event such as an earthquake, typhoon, volcanic eruption, fire, flood, tsunami, winter storms, terrorist attack, riots, social disturbances, political unrest, computer viruses, power loss, telecommunications failure, physical and electronic break-ins, hardware failures, hosting issues, domain name system issues, distributed denial-of-service attacks, content management system issues, malicious hackers, lapses in maintenance, and other similar events. The Company also maintains offshore and outsourced operations in the Philippines, an area that has been subjected to a typhoon and a volcanic eruption in the past, and Costa Rica, a seismically active region. The Company\u2019s engineering and product data development team is located in Ukraine and Belarus, which have been the subject of political unrest. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may recur in the future and could disrupt the operation of the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s technology infrastructure is also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, and not all of the Company\u2019s systems and data are fully redundant. Any substantial disruption of the Company\u2019s technology infrastructure could cause interruptions or delays in its business and loss of data or render it unable to accept and fulfill customer orders or operate its digital commerce platform in a timely manner, or at all.\nRisks Related to Litigation\nThe Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected by an ongoing legal proceeding with certain stockholders.\nIn March 2018, the founders of Onyx, predecessor to the Company, which founders then owned 48% of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares of common stock, filed a lawsuit against the then majority stockholder, which had acquired its 52% interest in Onyx in July 2015, and against Prashant Pathak, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, and certain other individuals and affiliates related to the majority stockholder. The minority stockholders allege, among other things, that they agreed to sell their shares in Onyx in reliance upon statements of the majority stockholder, Mr. Pathak and the other defendants that they subsequently would bring additional investors and capital to Onyx, and that the defendants fraudulently and intentionally made material misstatements concerning Onyx\u2019s valuation to potential investors. The claims of the minority stockholders involve various theories of fraud, breach of fiduciary duties, oppression of minority stockholders, and tortious interference with their prospective economic relations. None of the claims allege breach of any of the contracts entered into in connection with the July 2015 sale of shares to the majority stockholder. The majority stockholder filed counterclaims against the minority stockholders alleging breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, among other claims, and filed a third party claim against the Company for indemnification. The Company\u2019s insurance carrier denied coverage for the indemnification claim by the majority stockholder, and the Company has created a reserve with respect to that claim.\nOn September 30, 2020 certain of Onyx\u2019s minority stockholders filed a motion and form of order seeking to have one of its executive officers removed from his position, and demanding (i) that such officer repay all amounts paid to him since August 4, 2020, and (ii) that Onyx seek repayment of legal and auditing fees incurred. That motion was denied on January 21, 2021 by the Special Master. The Report of the Special Master is subject to review and approval by the Court.\nDepending upon the outcome of certain claims in the legal proceeding, the Company could be responsible for reimbursement of fees, costs and expenses of the plaintiffs under its legacy indemnification obligations pursuant to indemnification contracts with the respective plaintiffs, its charter and bylaws and New Jersey law. While all or a portion of any such indemnification obligations may be paid by the Company\u2019s directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, there can be no assurance as to the amounts that would be paid, if any, by the insurance carriers.\nAdditionally, among other forms of relief sought, the plaintiffs are seeking rescission of the sale of the 52% interest to the majority stockholder. If granted, a rescission could have a negative impact on the Company, including the transfer of a majority of its outstanding common stock to the minority stockholders. If any equitable adjustment of the ownership interests of the Company\u2019s current majority stockholder is made, such actions could result in the resignation or removal of Mr. Pathak or the other designee of the majority stockholder from the Company\u2019s board of directors and/or members of the Company\u2019s management team. Accordingly, the legal proceeding could adversely affect the functioning of the Company\u2019s board of directors and/or executive officers, lead to management distraction and interfere with the Company\u2019s operations, any of which could materially and adversely harm the Company\u2019s business and results of operation.\nIn addition, on October 3, 2020, counsel to the defendants in the Stockholder Litigation received a letter from counsel to the minority stockholders objecting to Onyx Enterprises Canada Inc.\u2019s use of the \u201cdrag-along right\u201d under Section 4.5 of the Stockholders Agreement, dated July 17, 2015 (the \u201cStockholders Agreement\u201d), and the proxy granted pursuant to Section 5.1 of the Stockholders Agreement to execute (i) the stockholder written consent, dated September 18, 2020, approving the Business Combination Agreement and (ii) the Stockholder Support Agreement, dated October 30, 2020, in each case on behalf of the minority stockholders. The letter also described the Business Combination as unlawful and threatened further unspecified actions by the minority stockholders.\nOn October 15, 2020, the minority stockholders filed an order to show cause to preliminarily enjoin the Business Combination pending final adjudication of the Stockholder Litigation. On October 23, 2020, the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Monmouth County refused to grant a preliminary injunction and set the hearing date on the order to show cause for December 4, 2020. On October 26, 2020, the minority stockholders filed an application for permission to file emergent motion to request a temporary restraining order preventing the closing of the Business Combination prior to the December 4th hearing with the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division, which such court denied. On October 27, 2020, the minority stockholders appealed the Appellate Division\u2019s ruling to the Supreme Court of New Jersey. On October 28, 2020, the Supreme Court of New Jersey denied such appeal. On November 20, 2020, the minority stockholders requested another emergent motion before the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Monmouth County for a temporary restraining order preventing the closing of the Business Combination. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Monmouth County denied that request by order dated November 20, 2020.\nFor additional information regarding legal actions, claims and administrative proceedings that management believes could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows, including further information on the ongoing litigation with certain minority stockholders and the notice of violation it received from the EPA, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBecause the Company is involved in litigation from time to time and is subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations, it could incur substantial judgments, fines, legal fees and other costs as well as reputational harm.\nThe Company is sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers, employees, or other third parties for various reasons. For example, Stanislav Royzenshteyn, the former Chief Executive Officer of Onyx, a predecessor to the Company, alleged that Onyx failed to pay him amounts owed under his employment agreement, including, but not limited to, unpaid bonuses, salary, personal, sick and vacation days, and employment-related reimbursements. The damages sought against the Company in some of these litigation proceedings could be substantial. Although the Company maintains liability insurance for some litigation claims, if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed its insurance coverage limits or if its insurance policies do not cover a claim, this could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company is also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to, among other things, environmental protection, product quality and safety standards, labor and employment, discrimination, anti-bribery/anti-corruption, data privacy and income taxes. Compliance with existing and future laws and regulations could increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. If the Company fails to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, it may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions, while incurring substantial legal fees and costs, as well as reputational risk. In addition, the Company\u2019s capital and operating expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if the Company is found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations.\nFor additional information regarding legal actions, claims and administrative proceedings that management believes could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows, including ongoing litigation with certain minority stockholders and the notice of violation it received from the EPA, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company faces exposure to product liability lawsuits.\nThe automotive industry in general has been subject to a large number of product liability claims due to the nature of personal injuries that result from car accidents or malfunctions. As a distributor of automotive parts and accessories, including parts and accessories obtained overseas, the Company could be held liable for the injury or damage caused if the products it sells are defective or malfunction, regardless of whether the product manufacturer is the party at fault. While the Company carries insurance against product liability claims, if the damages in any given action were high or the Company were subject to multiple lawsuits, the damages and costs could exceed the limits of its insurance coverage or prevent it from obtaining coverage in the future. If the Company were required to pay substantial damages as a result of these lawsuits, it may seriously harm its business and financial condition. Even defending against unsuccessful claims could cause the Company to incur significant expenses and result in a diversion of management\u2019s attention. In addition, even if the money damages themselves did not cause substantial harm to the Company\u2019s business, the damage to its reputation and the brands offered on its digital commerce platform could adversely affect its future reputation and its brand and could result in a decline in its net sales.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nConcentration of ownership among certain stockholders may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAs of March 5, 2021, each of Prashant Pathak, Chairman of the Board of the Company and a director and President of Onyx Enterprises Canada Inc. (\u201cOEC\u201d), Roman Gerashenko and Stanislav Royzenshteyn, beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, approximately 42.84%, 18.20%, and 18.20%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock, and our directors and executive officers as a group beneficially owned approximately 48.58% of our outstanding common stock. These beneficial ownership percentages do not reflect the pending issuance by the Company of an aggregate 300,000 shares of Class A common stock to each of these individuals according to their pro rata share of common stock of Onyx prior to the closing of the Business Combination. As of March 5, 2021, such issuance has not yet occurred, but is in process. As a result of their current holdings as supplemented by the issuance in process, these stockholders will be able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock. In addition, the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely impact its price.\nThe shares of common stock covered by the Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed on January 29, 2021, pursuant to which certain stockholders may sell their shares, represent approximately 88.78% of our outstanding common stock. Sales, or the potential sales, of substantial numbers of shares in the public market by those selling stockholders upon termination of applicable contractual lock-up agreements, could increase the volatility of the market price of our common stock or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid dividends on any of our capital stock and currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund the growth of our business. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend on our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that the Board may deem relevant. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Common Stock will be the sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nOur stock price is volatile, and you may not be able to sell shares of our Common Stock at or above the price you paid.\nThe trading price of our Common Stock is volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results;\n\u25cf failure to meet or exceed financial estimates and projections of the investment community or that we provide to the public;\n\u25cf issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts or changed recommendations for our stock or the transportation industry in general;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u25cf operating and share price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u25cf our focus on long-term goals over short-term results;\n\u25cf the timing and magnitude of our investments in the growth of our business;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key management or other personnel;\n\u25cf disputes or other developments related to our intellectual property or other proprietary rights, including litigation;\n\u25cf our ability to market new and enhanced products and technologies on a timely basis;\n\u25cf sales of substantial amounts of the common stock by the Board, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur;\n\u25cf changes in our capital structure, including future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt; and\n\u25cf general economic, political and market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the NYSE American in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nRisks Related to Our Being a Public Company\nWe will incur significant increased expenses and administrative burdens as a public company, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses as a public company that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), including the requirements of Section 404, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d) and the securities exchanges, impose additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. Compliance with public company requirements will increase costs and make certain activities more time-consuming. A number of those requirements require us to carry out activities that Onyx, as a private company, had not done previously. For example, we created new board committees and have adopted new internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, expenses associated with SEC reporting requirements will be incurred. Furthermore, if any issues in complying with those requirements are identified (for example, if the auditors identify a material weakness or significant deficiency in the internal control over financial reporting), we could incur additional costs rectifying those issues, and the existence of those issues could adversely affect our reputation or investor perceptions of it. In addition, we have obtained director and officer liability insurance. Risks associated with our status as a public company may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on the Board or as executive officers. The additional reporting and other obligations imposed by these rules and regulations increase legal and financial compliance costs and the costs of related legal, accounting and administrative activities. These increased costs will require us to divert a significant amount of money that could otherwise be used to expand the business and achieve strategic objectives. Advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt additional changes in governance and reporting requirements, which could further increase costs.\nOur failure to timely and effectively implement controls and procedures required by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs a public company, we are required to provide management\u2019s attestation on internal controls. The standards required for a public company under Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are significantly more stringent than those required of Onyx as a private company. Management may not be able to effectively and timely implement controls and procedures that adequately respond to the increased regulatory compliance and reporting requirements now applicable to it. If we are not able to implement the additional requirements of Section 404(a) in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may not be able to assess whether our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, which may subject us to adverse regulatory consequences and could harm investor confidence and the market price of our securities.\nOur management has limited experience in operating a public company.\nOur executive officers have limited experience in the management of a publicly traded company. Our management team may not successfully or effectively manage our transition to a public company that will be subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under federal securities laws. Their limited experience in dealing with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies could be a significant disadvantage in that it is likely that an increasing amount of their time may be devoted to these activities which will result in less time being devoted to the management and growth of the Company. We may not have adequate personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience, and training in the accounting policies, practices or internal controls over financial reporting required of public companies in the United States. The development and implementation of the standards and controls necessary for the Company to achieve the level of accounting standards required of a public company in the United States may require costs greater than expected. It is possible that we will be required to expand our employee base and hire additional employees to support our operations as a public company which will increase our operating costs in future periods.\nIf we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover the proceeds from our trust account that was set up when we were a special purpose acquisition company, and the members of our Board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing us and the members of our Board to claims of punitive damages.\nIf we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders holding shares of Common Stock could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders holding shares of common stock. In addition, our Board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing us and our Board to claims of punitive damages, by paying our stockholders holding shares of common stock from our trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors.\nThe Company is an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to those types of companies may make its securities less attractive to investors.\nThe Company is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, the Company is not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which would require the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting to be audited by its independent registered public accounting firm, has reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and is exempt from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Additionally, as an emerging growth company, the Company has elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies (as defined under Section 2(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). As such, the Company\u2019s financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nThe Company also is a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). As a smaller reporting company, the Company is entitled to rely on certain exemptions and reduced disclosure requirements, such as simplified executive compensation disclosures and reduced financial statement disclosure requirements, in the Company\u2019s SEC filings.\nThese exemptions and decreased disclosures in the Company\u2019s SEC filings due to our status as an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company may make it harder for investors to analyze the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial prospects. Investors may find our common stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our common stock price may be more volatile.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about the Company, its business or its market, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding the common stock, the price and trading volume of the common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about the Company, its business, market or competitors. Securities and industry analysts may never publish research on the Company. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of the Company, its stock price and trading volume would likely be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who may cover the Company change their recommendation regarding its common stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about its competitors, the price of its common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover the Company were to cease coverage of the Company or fail to regularly publish reports on it, it could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the Company\u2019s stock price or trading volume to decline.\nCertain minority stockholders of the Company could engage in activities that might be disruptive of the Company\u2019s ongoing business.\nCertain minority stockholders of the Company could engage in litigation against the Company and its directors seeking monetary damages and/or potentially distracting the Company\u2019s directors and officers from executing upon the Company\u2019s business plans, and could engage in shareholder activism that may be disruptive to the Company. See \u201c-The Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected by an ongoing legal proceeding with certain stockholders\u201d for more information regarding litigation brought by these minority stockholders prior to the Business Combination.\nThe Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by the Company\u2019s stockholders, which could limit its stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the stockholders of the Company, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Company, its directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) or the second amended and restated certificate of incorporation or the amended and restated bylaws of the Company (the \u201cBylaws\u201d), or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Company, its directors, officers or employees is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The Company\u2019s bylaws designate the federal district courts of the United States as the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws described above. In addition, Section 22 of the Securities Act provides that federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over lawsuits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. To the extent the exclusive forum provision restricts the courts in which claims arising under the Securities Act may be brought, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a provision. We note that investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company and its directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 17090, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "LGC"}
