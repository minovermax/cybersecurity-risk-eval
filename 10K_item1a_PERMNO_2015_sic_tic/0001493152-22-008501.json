RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes in Part II - Item 8, you should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating our business, operations and financial condition. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or that are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or businesses in general, such as competitive conditions, may also impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, discussed in more detail in the following section. These risks include, among others, the following key risks:\n\u25cf Our operating history of net losses, negative working capital and insufficient cash flows, and lack of liquidity to pay our current obligations raise doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern.\n\u25cf The COVID-19 global pandemic may continue to materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25cf\nWe have and may continue to experience intangible asset or other long-lived asset impairment charges.\n\u25cf\nWe have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\n\u25cf Due to how we recognize revenue, our quarterly revenue and operating results are likely to fluctuate.\n\u25cf\nA deterioration in the collectability of our accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25cf We depend on sales and reimbursements from our clinical services for more than 50% of our revenue, and we will need to generate sufficient revenue from these and other products and/or solutions that we develop or acquire to grow our business.\n\u25cf Two private equity firms and their affiliates\u2019 control, on an as-converted basis, an aggregate of 65% of our outstanding shares of common stock through their holdings of our Series B Preferred Stock, and this concentration of ownership along with their authority for designation rights for a majority of our directors and their right to approve certain of our actions has a substantial influence on our decisions.\n\u25cf Our secured lenders have the right to foreclose on substantially all of our assets if we are unable to timely repay our outstanding obligations.\n\u25cf Billing for our clinical services tests is complex, and we must dedicate substantial time and resources to the billing process to be paid for our clinical services tests.\n\u25cf We depend on a few payers for a significant portion of our revenue for our clinical services, and if one or more significant payers, including CMS, stops providing reimbursement or decreases the amount of reimbursement for our tests, or if we are unable to successfully negotiate additional reimbursement contracts for our clinical services tests, our revenue could decline and our commercial success could be compromised. Our reliance on Medicare reimbursement for our clinical services and our being subject to decisions of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) regarding reimbursement and pricing of our clinical services which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results, which has temporarily had a material adverse effect on our business due to a new billing policy issued by CMS in January 2022 whereby CMS stated they would no longer reimburse for the use of the Company\u2019s ThyGeNEXT\u00ae and ThyraMIR\u00ae tests when billed together by the same provider/supplier for the same beneficiary on the same date of service; while this decision was subsequently reversed in February 2022, the Company has not yet realized the full cash collection benefit of current and retroactive Thyroid testing and such cash collections may be temporarily reduced or delayed until we resolved the matter with CMS;\n\u25cf We rely on third-parties to process and transmit claims to payers for our clinical services, and any delay in processing or transmitting could have an adverse effect on our revenue and financial condition.\n\u25cf We may experience a decline in demand for our clinical services tests and/or our pharma services products, which may result in a reduction in revenue.\n\u25cf If we are unable to increase sales of our clinical services and the tests and services in our pharma services, we may be unable to achieve profitability.\n\u25cf Our profitability will be impaired by our obligations to make royalty and milestone payments to our licensors for our clinical services tests.\n\u25cf We depend on third parties for the supply of some of the materials used in our clinical and pharma services tests, and we may not be able to find replacements or transition to alternative suppliers in a timely manner.\n\u25cf The markets that our clinical services and pharma services operate in is competitive, and our ability to compete successfully in this market depends on a variety of reasons, including our ability to keep up with rapid technological, medical, and scientific changes or our ability to enter into new clinical study collaborations. If we are unable to compete successfully in the markets our clinical services and pharma services operate in, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue or achieve profitability.\n\u25cf If the FDA changes its enforcement policy as to laboratory developed tests (LDTs) or disagrees with our position that our clinical services tests are LDTs covered by the FDA\u2019s current enforcement discretion policy, we could be subject to a number of enforcement actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our clinical services and/or incur substantial costs and delays associated with trying to obtain pre-market clearance or approval and comply with applicable post-market requirements.\n\u25cf A failure to comply with federal and state laws and regulations, including but not limited to those laws related to billing practices, fraud, abuse, and payer regulations, could result in our being excluded from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental payer programs and/or significant monetary fines, and additionally may decrease our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition for our clinical services.\n\u25cf We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of our pharma services or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\n\u25cf If we are unable to successfully utilize, integrate, and/or promote our pharma services in the market, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain our pharma services.\n\u25cf If we fail to perform our pharma services in accordance with contractual and regulatory requirements, and ethical considerations, we could be subject to significant costs, legal liabilities and could experience a decline in revenue.\n\u25cf The loss of members of our senior management team or our inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our business.\n\u25cf If we fail to comply with federal, state and foreign laboratory licensing requirements, we could lose the ability to perform our tests or experience disruptions to our business.\n\u25cf Legislation reforming the U.S. healthcare system may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\n\u25cf If we do not increase our revenues and successfully manage the size of our operations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\u25cf The risks associated with penny stock classification could affect the marketability of the Company\u2019s common stock and stockholders could find it difficult to sell their shares.\n\u25cf We believe the delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq and trading on OTCQX\u00ae has adversely affected trading in our common stock and our ability to seek financing.\n\u25cf If we are unable to maintain and implement effective internal controls over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our reported financial information and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\nRisks Related to our Business\nThere are substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern due to our operating history of net losses, negative working capital and insufficient cash flows, and lack of liquidity to pay our current obligations and if we are unable to continue our business, our shares may have little or no value.\nOur ability to become a profitable operating company is dependent upon our ability to generate revenues and/or obtain financing adequate to support our cost structure. We do not currently have enough cash on hand to meet our obligations over the next twelve months, and we cannot provide our stockholders any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the generation of revenue, the sale of our common stock, or through financing to sustain us over the next twelve months.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, we had an operating loss of $14.0 million. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.1 million and current liabilities of $15.7 million. The Company must fund its operating deficit until a sustainable level of revenue is achieved. These factors have raised substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. We may need to attempt to raise additional equity capital by selling shares of common stock or other dilutive or non-dilutive means, if necessary. However, the doubts raised, relating to our ability to continue as a going concern, may make investing in our securities an unattractive investment for potential investors. These factors, among others, may make it difficult to raise any additional capital.\nOur results of operations have been adversely affected and, in the future, could be materially adversely impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nThe world is currently suffering a COVID-19 pandemic which has resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including stay-at-home orders, temporarily closing businesses, restricting gatherings, restricting travel, and mandating social distancing and face coverings. The continuing impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our operations, including duration, severity and scope, remains highly uncertain and cannot be fully predicted at this time. Such impact is a function of the scope of any new virus mutations and outbreaks, the nature of government public health guidelines and the public\u2019s adherence to those guidelines, the rate of individuals becoming fully vaccinated, the public\u2019s adherence to guidelines to receive booster shots, the success of business and economic recovery as the pandemic recedes, unemployment levels, the extent to which new shutdowns may be needed and the impact of any further government economic relief on the U.S. economy. In particular, the continued spread of the coronavirus globally is adversely affecting global economies and financial markets which has materially and adversely impacted our operations including, without limitation, the functioning of our laboratories, the availability of supplies including reagents, the progress and data collection of our pharma services, demand for our services and travel, customer demand and employee health and availability. Further, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in part caused us to reevaluate the carrying charge of our intangible assets and led us to restate certain of our financial statements to record impairment charges and amortization expense. While we believe we have generally recovered from the adverse impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on our business during 2020, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition in the future.\nThe ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has caused geopolitical instability, economic uncertainty, financial markets volatility and capital markets disruption. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any negative impact on the capital markets resulting from the conflict in Ukraine or any other geopolitical tensions.\nIn late February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, significantly amplifying already existing geopolitical tensions among Russia and other countries in the region and in the west, including the U.S. Russia\u2019s invasion, the responses of countries and political bodies to Russia\u2019s actions, the larger overarching tensions, and Ukraine\u2019s military response and the potential for wider conflict have resulted in financial market volatility and capital markets disruption, potentially increasing in magnitude, and could have severe adverse effects on regional and global economic markets and international relations. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be substantial.\nFollowing Russia\u2019s actions, various countries, including the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom, as well as the European Union, issued broad-ranging economic sanctions against Russia. Such sanctions included, among other things, a prohibition on doing business with certain Russian companies, officials and oligarchs; a commitment by certain countries and the European Union to remove selected Russian banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) electronic banking network that connects banks globally; a ban on Russian oil and gas imports to the U.S.; and restrictive measures to prevent the Russian Central Bank from undermining the impact of the sanctions. The current sanctions (and potential further sanctions in response to continued Russian military activity) and other actions may have adverse effects on regional and global economic markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets, potentially making it more difficult for us to obtain additional funds and increasing the volatility of our stock price. Any of the abovementioned factors could affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.\nActions that we have taken to restructure our business to strengthen the Company\u2019s profile, enhance shareholder values, and increase revenue growth may not be as effective as anticipated.\nDuring Fiscal 2020 and 2021, we implemented certain restructuring and reprioritization plans to strengthen the Company\u2019s profile, enhance shareholder values, and increase revenue growth, by engaging in actions that included, but were not limited to, corporate reprioritization efforts and implementation of various cost saving measures. These plans included the transition of pharma activities from the Rutherford, NJ facility to our Morrisville, NC facility in order to optimize the operations of laboratory operations within our pharma services. We invested several million dollars to facilitate this relocation which was completed in March 2021, including but not limited to the transfer of personnel, expansion of the Morrisville facility and validation of transferred processes. While we expect to realize cost-saving benefits from these initiatives, these actions may not be successful and may not bring the cost saving benefits that we anticipate.\nWe have a history of operating losses, and our clinical and pharma services have generated limited revenue. We expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nAlthough we expect our revenue to grow in the future, there can be no assurance that we will achieve revenue sufficient to offset expenses. Over the next several years, we expect to (i) continue to devote resources to increase adoption of, and reimbursement for, our clinical services tests and assays and to use our bioinformatics data to develop and enhance our clinical services products and services, (ii) leverage and invest in our pharma services to expand and enhance our pharma services and (iii) develop and acquire additional products and services. However, our business may never achieve or sustain profitability, and our failure to achieve and sustain profitability in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have and may continue to experience intangible asset impairment charges.\nWe are required to evaluate the carrying value of intangibles at least annually, and between annual tests if events or circumstances warrant such a test. We review the recoverability of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized by reducing the recorded value of the asset to its fair value measured by future discounted cash flows. This analysis requires estimates of the amount and timing of projected cash flows and, where applicable, judgments associated with, among other factors, the appropriate discount rate. Such estimates are critical in determining whether any impairment charge should be recorded and the amount of such charge if an impairment loss is deemed to be necessary. Writing down or reserving for other intangible assets or impairments has had and would have a negative and unexpected impact on our net worth.\nIn January 2021, we filed restated financial statements contained in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2014 through 2019 as well as the financial statements contained in the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each quarterly period within those fiscal years as well as the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020. Such restatements reflected a non-cash impairment charge and amortization expense related to our Barrett\u2019s intangible asset of approximately $18 million.\nWe have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe began commercial sales of our molecular diagnostic tests in late 2014. On July 15, 2019, we acquired the pharma services business. We conduct our business through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Interpace Diagnostics, LLC, which was formed in Delaware in 2013, Interpace Diagnostics Corporation (formerly known as RedPath Integrated Pathology, Inc.), which was formed in Delaware in 2007, and Interpace BioPharma, Inc., which was formed in Delaware in 2019. On November 12, 2019 we changed the name of Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. to Interpace Biosciences, Inc. and that of our newly-formed subsidiary, Interpace BioPharma, Inc. to Interpace Pharma Solutions, Inc. Consequently, any evaluations about our future success, performance or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history.\nOur quarterly and annual revenues and operating results may vary which may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may vary as a result of a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf uncertainty of cash collections which could impact or affect net realizable values of sales of our tests and services;\n\u25cf inability of one or more of our laboratories to perform tests;\n\u25cf progress or lack of progress in developing and commercializing tests and services;\n\u25cf favorable or unfavorable decisions about our tests or services or reimbursement rates from government regulators, insurances companies, customers, or other third party payers;\n\u25cf the commencement, delay, cancellation or completion of sales and marketing programs;\n\u25cf timing and amount of expenses for implementing new programs and accuracy of estimates of resources required for ongoing programs;\n\u25cf adoption of and coverage and reimbursement for our tests;\n\u25cf changes in our relationships with key collaborators, suppliers, customers and third parties;\n\u25cf fluctuations in net revenue due to changes in the valuation of our patient accounts;\n\u25cf periodic stock-based compensation and awards;\n\u202f\n\u25cf mark to market fluctuations in the valuation of our warrant liabilities;\n\u25cf changes in valuation for contingent consideration related to acquired assets;\n\u25cf fluctuations in R&D, business development and spending for clinical trials;\n\u25cf timing and integration of any acquisitions; and\n\u25cf changes in regulations related to diagnostics, pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare companies.\nWe believe that quarterly, and in certain instances annual, comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Fluctuations in quarterly and annual results could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock in a manner unrelated to our long-term operating performance.\nWe depend on sales and reimbursements from our clinical services for more than 50% of our revenue, and we will need to generate sufficient revenue from these and other products and/or solutions that we develop or acquire to grow our business.\nMore than 50% of our revenue is derived from our clinical services. We have molecular diagnostics tests and complimentary service extensions that are in development, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully commercialize or sufficiently increase revenues from those tests. If we are unable to increase sales of our molecular diagnostic tests, expand reimbursement for these tests, or successfully develop and commercialize other molecular diagnostic tests, our revenue and our ability to achieve and sustain profitability would be impaired, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nWe rely on third-parties to process and transmit claims to payers for our clinical services, and any delay in processing or transmitting could have an adverse effect on our revenue and financial condition.\nWe rely on third-parties to provide overall processing of claims and to transmit actual claims to payers based on specific payer billing formats. In 2019, we transitioned to a new third-party processor and there can be no assurance that we will not experience interruptions or collection delays with our future billings, an occurrence of which may adversely impact our revenue and financial condition. If claims for our clinical services are not submitted to payers on a timely basis, or if we are again required to switch to a different third-party processor to handle claim submissions, we may experience delays in our ability to process claims and receive payment from payers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to how we recognize revenue, our quarterly revenue and operating results are likely to fluctuate.\nWe adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) ASU 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d (or \u201cASC 606\u201d) effective January 1, 2018. As of this date, all revenue is recognized on the accrual basis, based upon actual collection histories for tests and services and respective payers or payer groups. Due to this change in accounting and the estimations required under ASC 606, our quarterly revenue and operating results are likely to fluctuate. As we recognize revenue from payers under ASC 606, we may subsequently determine that certain judgments underlying estimated reimbursement change, or that the estimates we used at the time we accrued such revenue vary materially from the actual reimbursements subsequently realized, and our financial results could be negatively impacted in future quarters. We experienced an adjustment in our estimate for variable consideration under ASC 606 during the fourth quarter of 2019 which resulted in a $5.2 million reduction in revenue recognized year to date; however there have been no such adjustments since then.\nAs a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may be difficult due to fluctuations resulting from the estimation process under ASC 606 and such comparisons may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. In addition, these fluctuations in revenue may make it difficult in the near term for us, research analysts and investors to accurately forecast our revenue and operating results. If our revenue or operating results fall below consensus expectations, the price of our common stock would likely decline.\nA deterioration in the collectability of our accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCollection of accounts receivable from third-party payers and clients is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks are (i) the risk of overestimating our net revenue at the time of billing, which may result in us receiving less than the recorded receivable, (ii) the risk of non-payment as a result of denied claims, (iii) in certain states, the risk that clients will fail to remit insurance payments to us when the commercial insurance company pays out-of-network claims directly to the client and (iv) resource and capacity constraints that may prevent us from handling the volume of billing and collection issues in a timely manner. Additionally, our ability to hire and retain experienced personnel affects our ability to bill and collect accounts in a timely manner. We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of the client accounts and factor them into our estimation of collectability as warranted. Significant changes in business operations, payer mix or economic conditions, including changes resulting from legislation or other health reform efforts (including to repeal or significantly change the Affordable Care Act), could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, increased client concentration in states that permit commercial insurance companies to pay out-of-network claims directly to the client instead of the provider, could adversely affect our collection of receivables. Unexpected changes in reimbursement rates by third-party payers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is substantially dependent on third-party reimbursement. Any change in the overall health care reimbursement system may adversely impact our business.\nOur revenues are substantially dependent on third-party reimbursement. We are paid directly by private insurers and governmental agencies, often on a fixed fee basis. If the average fees allowable by private insurers or governmental agencies were reduced, the negative impact on revenues could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Also, if amounts owed to us by payors are reduced or not paid on a timely basis, we may be required to increase our concessions and/or decrease our revenues. Changes to the health care reimbursement system that favor other technologies or treatment regimens and reduce our reimbursements may adversely affect our ability to market our services profitably. Overall, such dependency and potential changes could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur inability to finance our business on acceptable terms in the future may limit our ability to develop and commercialize products and services and grow our business.\nOur business is not currently operating on a cash flow breakeven or positive basis, and as a result, we may need to finance our business in the future through collaborations, equity offerings, debt financings, licensing arrangements or other dilutive or non-dilutive means. On January 7, 2021, we entered into promissory notes (\u201cNotes\u201d) with our two private equity investors in the aggregate amount of $5 million with a maturity date of June 30, 2021 which were secured by all of our assets. In October 2021, the Company entered into a $7.5 million revolving credit facility with Comerica Bank (\u201cComerica\u201d). In addition, also in October 2021, the Company entered into an $8.0 million term loan with BroadOak Fund V, L.P. (\u201cBroadOak\u201d), the proceeds of which were used to repay in full at their maturity the Notes extended by our two private equity investors. The BroadOak loan agreement contains affirmative and negative restrictive covenants, including restrictions on certain mergers, acquisitions, investments and encumbrances which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The BroadOak loan agreement also contains customary events of default. The Comerica loan agreement contains affirmative and negative restrictive covenants that are applicable whether or not any amounts are outstanding under the Comerica loan agreement. These restrictive covenants, which include restrictions on certain mergers, acquisitions, investments, encumbrances, etc., could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The Comerica loan agreement also contains financial covenants requiring specified minimum liquidity and minimum revenue thresholds and also contains customary events of default.\nWe will need additional funding to repay the Comerica and BroadOak borrowings as well as to continue operations. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we seek to raise funds by issuing additional equity securities, dilution to our stockholders could result. Any public offering of equity securities must be approved by the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock who are our private equity investors. In addition, we are currently ineligible to use a Form S-3 shelf registration statement. If we are unable to timely repay the Comerica and BroadOak borrowings when due, Comerica and BroadOak will have the right to foreclose on our assets (BroadOak being subordinated to Comerica). The incurrence of additional indebtedness or the issuance of certain equity securities could result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights, limitations on our ability to enter into mergers or acquisition of assets, and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nIf we are unable to timely repay our outstanding obligations, our secured lenders will have the right to foreclose on our assets.\nIn October 2021, the Company entered into a $7.5 million revolving credit facility with Comerica and an $8.0 million term loan with BroadOak, which are secured by all of our assets. We will need additional funding to repay these outstanding obligations as well as to continue operations. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to timely repay these outstanding obligations, our secured lenders will have the right to foreclose on substantially all of our assets.\nRisks Related to our Preferred Stock\nWe have issued and may issue additional preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of our common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our Board may determine the terms of future preferred stock offerings without further action by our stockholders. If we issue additional preferred stock, it could affect stockholder rights or reduce the market value of our outstanding common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, sinking fund provisions, and restrictions on our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party. We have designated, issued and sold an aggregate of 47,000 outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock.\nTwo private equity firms and their affiliate\u2019s control, on an as-converted basis, an aggregate of 65% of our outstanding shares of common stock through their holdings of our Series B Preferred Stock, and this concentration of ownership along with their authority for designation rights for a majority of our directors and their right to approve certain of our actions has a substantial influence on our decisions.\nAmpersand holds 28,000 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock and 1315 Capital holds 19,000 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock. Accordingly, on an as converted basis, Ampersand and its affiliates beneficially own 38.7% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock of 4,217,063 and 1315 Capital and its affiliates beneficially own 26.3%. The conversion and sale by such holders of one or more large blocks of our common stock could have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\nThese stockholders, acting together, have control over the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Holders of Series B Preferred Stock were granted director designation rights over a majority of our Board. Accordingly, these stockholders, acting together, have significant influence over our management and affairs. This concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock by delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control, making some transactions more difficult or impossible to complete without the support of these shareholders, regardless of the impact of this transaction on our other shareholders. Such ownership interests could effectively deter a third party from making an offer to buy us, which might involve a premium over our current stock price or other benefits for our stockholders, or otherwise prevent changes in the control or management. For example, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nThe holders of our Series B Preferred Stock have preferential rights that may be adverse to holders of our common stock.\nThe holders of our Series B Preferred Stock have preferential rights with respect to distributions upon a liquidation of the Company, including certain business combinations or sales of assets deemed to be a liquidation. Accordingly, no distributions upon liquidation may be made to the holders of common stock until the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock have been paid their liquidation preference. As a result, it is possible that, on a liquidation event and depending on the price thereof, all amounts available for the holders of equity of the Company would be paid to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock, and that the holders of common stock would not receive any payment. In addition, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock have the right to approve certain actions of the Company.\nIn April 2020, 1315 Capital consented to, and agreed to vote (by proxy or otherwise) their Series B Preferred Stock in favor of any \u201cFundamental Action\u201d taken by the Company as determined by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. \u201cFundamental Actions\u201d include the Company\u2019s ability to a) authorize, create or issue any debt securities for borrowed money or funded debt; b) merge with or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of one or more other companies or entities with a value in excess of $20 million; c) transfer, by sale, exclusive license or otherwise, material intellectual property rights of the Company or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, other than those accomplished in the ordinary course of business; d) declare or pay any cash dividend or make any cash distribution on any equity interests of the Company other than the Series B Shares; e) incur any additional individual debt, indebtedness for borrowed money or other additional liabilities; and f) change any accounting methods or practices of the Company, except for those changes required by GAAP or applicable regulatory agencies or authorities.\nRisks Related to our Clinical Services\nBilling for our clinical services tests is complex, and we must dedicate substantial time and resources to the billing process to be paid for our clinical services tests.\nBilling for clinical services is complex, time consuming and expensive. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various payers, including Medicare, insurance companies and patients, all of which have different billing requirements. To the extent laws or contracts require us to bill patient co-payments or co-insurance; we must also comply with these requirements. We may also face increased risk in our collection efforts, including write-offs of doubtful accounts and long collection cycles, which could have a material adverse effect on our clinical services, results of operations and financial condition. Among others, the following factors make the billing process complex:\n\u25cf differences between the list price for our molecular diagnostic tests and the reimbursement rates of payers;\n\u25cf compliance with complex federal and state regulations related to billing Medicare;\n\u25cf changes in billing policy reimbursement by CMS;\n\u25cf disputes among payers as to which party is responsible for payment;\n\u25cf differences in coverage among payers and the effect of patient co-payments or co-insurance;\n\u25cf differences in information and billing requirements among payers;\n\u25cf incorrect or missing billing information;\n\u25cf the resources required to manage the billing and claims appeals process including those of our billing service providers;\n\u25cf our inability to bill timely and accurate requisitions and process denials efficiently may result in delayed collections and reduced reimbursement rates; and\n\u25cf the overall performance and effectiveness of our billing service providers.\nAs we grow and introduce new clinical services tests and other services, we will likely need to add new codes to our billing process as well as our financial reporting systems. Failure or delays in effecting these changes in external billing and internal systems and processes could negatively affect our revenue and cash flow from our clinical services. Additionally, our billing activities require us to implement compliance procedures and oversight, train and monitor our employees or contractors, challenge coverage and payment denials, assist patients in appealing claims, and undertake internal audits to evaluate compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures. Payers also conduct external audits to evaluate payments, which add further complexity to the billing process. These billing complexities, and the related uncertainty in obtaining payment for our diagnostic solutions, could negatively affect our revenue and cash flow, our ability to achieve profitability, and the consistency and comparability of our results of operations.\nWe depend on a few payers for a significant portion of our revenue for our clinical services, and if one or more significant payers, including CMS, stops providing reimbursement or decreases the amount of reimbursement for our tests, or if we are unable to successfully negotiate additional reimbursement contracts for our clinical services tests, our revenue could decline and our commercial success could be compromised.\nRevenue for clinical services tests performed on patients covered by Medicare was approximately 54% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. The percentage of our revenue derived from significant payers for our clinical services tests is expected to fluctuate from period to period as our revenue increases, as additional payers provide reimbursement for such tests, and in the event that one or more payers were to stop reimbursing for our clinical services tests or change their reimbursement amounts.\nIn January 2022, the Company announced that CMS issued a new billing policy whereby CMS will no longer reimburse for the use of the Company\u2019s ThyGeNEXT\u00ae and ThyraMIR\u00ae tests when billed together by the same provider/supplier for the same beneficiary on the same date of service. On February 28, 2022, the Company announced that the National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) program issued a response on behalf of CMS stating that the January 2022 billing policy reimbursement change for ThyGeNEXT\u00ae (0245U) and ThyraMIR\u00ae (0018U) tests has been retroactively reversed to January 1, 2022. CMS is currently reimbursing the Company for one of its two thyroid tests, and has agreed to retroactively reimburse for the second test once they have completed their internal administrative adjustments. We have been notified by CMS/NCCI that processing of claims for dates of service after January 1, 2022 will be completed beginning July 1, 2022. As of the date of this filing, the Company has not yet realized the full cash collection benefit of current and retroactive Thyroid testing and such cash collections may be temporarily reduced or delayed until we resolved the matter with CMS.\nNovitas Solutions has been and is the current regional MAC that handles claims processing for Medicare services with jurisdiction for PancraGEN\u00ae, ThyGeNEXT\u00ae, ThyraMIR\u00ae, and RespriDx\u00ae. On a five-year rotational basis, Medicare requests bids for its regional MAC services. Any future changes in the MAC processing or coding for Medicare claims for our molecular diagnostic tests could result in a change in the coverage or reimbursement rates for such molecular diagnostic tests, or the loss of coverage.\nOur PancraGEN\u00ae, ThyraMIR\u00ae and ThyGeNEXT\u00ae tests are reimbursed by Medicare based on applicable CPT codes. RespriDx\u00ae is currently only covered by the Medicare Advantage program and our BarreGEN\u00ae assay is not reimbursed at all. Any future reductions from the current reimbursement rates for our clinical services tests would have a material adverse effect on business and results of operations.\nAlthough we have entered into contracts with certain third-party payers which establish allowable rates of reimbursement for our clinical services tests, payers may suspend or discontinue reimbursement at any time, may require or increase co-payments from patients, or may reduce the reimbursement rates paid to us. Any such actions could have a negative effect on our revenue for our clinical services tests.\nIf payers do not provide reimbursement, rescind or modify their reimbursement policies or delay payments for clinical services, or if we are unable to successfully negotiate additional reimbursement contracts for our clinical services tests, our commercial success could be compromised.\nPhysicians may generally not order our clinical services tests unless payers reimburse a substantial portion of the test price. There is uncertainty concerning third-party reimbursement of any test incorporating new molecular diagnostic technology. Reimbursement by a payer may depend on a number of factors, including a payer\u2019s determination that tests such as our molecular diagnostic tests are: (a) not experimental or investigational; (b) pre-authorized and appropriate for the patient; (c) cost-effective; (d) supported by peer-reviewed publications; and (e) included in clinical practice guidelines. Since each payer generally makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy or enter into a contract to reimburse our clinical services tests, seeking these approvals is a time-consuming and costly process. Although we have contracted rates of reimbursement with certain payers, which establishes allowable rates of reimbursement for our PancraGEN\u00ae, ThyGeNEXT\u00ae, ThyraMIR\u00ae and RespriDx\u00ae assays, payers may suspend or discontinue reimbursement at any time, may require or increase co-payments from patients, may impose pre-authorization requirements or may reduce the reimbursement rates paid to us. Any such actions could have a negative effect on our revenue for our clinical services tests.\nWe have contracted rates of reimbursement with select payers for PancraGEN\u00ae, ThyGeNEXT\u00ae and ThyraMIR\u00ae and to a limited extent, RespriDx\u00ae. Without a contracted rate for reimbursement, claims may be denied upon submission, and we may need to appeal the claims. The appeals process is time consuming and expensive, and may not result in payment. We expect to continue to focus resources on increasing adoption of and coverage and reimbursement for our molecular diagnostic tests. We cannot, however, predict whether, under what circumstances, or at what payment levels payers will reimburse us for our molecular diagnostic tests, if at all. In addition to our current commercial products on the market and in our pipeline, the launch of any new molecular diagnostic tests in the future may require that we expend substantial time and resources in order to obtain and retain reimbursement. Also, payer consolidation can create uncertainty as to whether coverage and contracts with existing payers will even remain in effect. Finally, commercial payers may tie their allowable rates to Medicare rates, and should Medicare reduce their rates, we may be negatively impacted. If we fail to establish broad adoption of and reimbursement for our assays, or if we are unable to maintain existing reimbursement from payers, our ability to generate revenue for our clinical services tests could be harmed and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience a reduction in revenue if physicians decide not to order our clinical services tests.\nIf we are unable to create or maintain sufficient demand for our clinical services tests or if we are unable to expand our product offerings, we may not become profitable. To generate demand, we will need to continue to educate physicians and the medical community on the value and benefits of our clinical services tests in order to change clinical practices through clinical trials, published papers, presentations at scientific conferences and one-on-one education by our commercial sales force, which are costly and time-consuming. In addition, our ability to obtain and maintain adequate reimbursement from third-party payers for our clinical services tests will be critical to generating revenue.\nIn many cases, practice guidelines in the United States have recommended therapies or surgery to determine if a patient\u2019s condition is malignant or benign. Accordingly, physicians may be reluctant to order a diagnostic test that may suggest surgery is unnecessary. In addition, our assays are performed at our laboratories rather than by a pathologist in a local laboratory, so pathologists may be reluctant to support our tests. Moreover, guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid nodules may change to recommend another type of treatment protocol, and these changes may result in medical practitioners deciding not to use our molecular diagnostic tests. These facts may make physicians reluctant to use our assays, which could limit our ability to generate revenue from our clinical services tests and achieve profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience a reduction in revenue if patients decide not to use our clinical services tests.\nSome patients may decide not to use our clinical services tests due to price, all or part of which may be payable directly by the patient if the patient\u2019s insurer denies reimbursement in full or in part. Many insurers seek to shift more of the cost of healthcare to patients in the form of higher deductibles, co-payments, or premiums. In addition, the economic environment in the United States may result in the loss of healthcare coverage. Implementation of provisions of PPACA provided coverage for patients, particularly in the individual market, who were previously either uninsured or faced high premiums. However, premiums for many of the plans participating in the exchanges established as part of this legislation have increased and some health plans have chosen to drop out of these networks in specific markets or the program altogether. In 2018, Congress passed legislation revising certain provisions of PPACA and federal agencies also have issued final rules to repeal or revise regulations governing the implementation of certain provisions of PPACA which may negatively impact our revenues. Overall, the scope and timing of any further legislation, judicial action or federal regulations to limit, revise, or replace PPACA or regulations governing its implementation is uncertain, but if enacted could have a significant impact on the U.S. healthcare system and our revenues. These events may result in an increase of uninsured patients, increases in premiums, and reductions in coverage for some patients. Patients may therefore delay or forego medical checkups or treatment due to their inability to pay for our clinical services tests, which could have a negative effect on our revenues. We do have a Patient Assistance Program that allows eligible patients to apply for assistance in covering a portion of their out of pocket obligation or all costs for claims denied as non-covered for our clinical services tests if they meet the criteria for participation.\nIf our clinical services tests do not perform as expected, we may not be able to achieve widespread market adoption among physicians, which would cause our operating results, reputation, and business to suffer.\nOur success depends in part on the market\u2019s confidence that we can provide reliable, high-quality molecular information products. There is no guarantee that the accuracy and reproducibility we have demonstrated to date will continue, particularly for clinical samples, as our test volume increases. We believe that our customers are likely to be particularly sensitive to product defects and errors, including if our products fail to detect genomic alterations with high accuracy from clinical specimens or if we fail to list, or inaccurately include, certain treatment options and available clinical trials in our product reports. As a result, the failure of our products to perform as expected would significantly impair our operating results and our reputation. We may be subject to legal claims arising from any defects or errors in our clinical services tests.\nOur profitability will be impaired by our obligations to make royalty and milestone payments to our licensors for our clinical services tests.\nIn connection with our acquisition of certain assets of Asuragen in 2014, we currently license certain patents and know-how from Asuragen relating to (i) miRInform\u00ae thyroid and pancreas cancer diagnostic tests and other tests in development for thyroid cancer (the \u201cAsuragen License Agreement\u201d), and (ii) the sale of diagnostic devices and the performance of certain services relating to thyroid cancer (the \u201cCPRIT License Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Asuragen License Agreement and the CPRIT License Agreement, we are obligated to make certain royalty and milestone payments to Asuragen and the Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas, or CPRIT. Under the Asuragen License Agreement, we are obligated to pay royalties on the future net sales of tests utilizing the miRInform\u00ae thyroid platform (i.e., ThyGeNEXT\u00ae), potentially on certain other thyroid diagnostics tests and potentially on other tests in development for thyroid cancer. A similar obligation exists if we elect to launch any molecular tests utilizing the miRInform\u00ae pancreas platform. We are also required by the CPRIT License Agreement with Asuragen to make certain related royalty payments to CPRIT.\nWhen performing the ThyraMIR\u00ae test, we use products supplied by Exiqon A/S (now a part of Qiagen), subject to a license agreement with Exiqon A/S. The license agreement obligates us to pay royalties on the future net sales of our assays that utilize licensed patents and know-how obtained from Exiqon A/S. Our profitability will be impaired by our obligations to make royalty payments to our licensors. Although we believe, under such circumstances, that the increase in revenue will exceed the corresponding royalty payments, our obligations to our licensors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to manage our operating costs and expenses at profitable levels.\nIf we breach certain agreements with Asuragen, it could have a material adverse effect on our sales and commercialization efforts for our thyroid cancer diagnostic tests as well as any potential tests in development for thyroid cancer utilizing their technology and the sale of diagnostic devices and the performance of certain services relating to thyroid cancer.\nUnder the CPRIT License Agreement, we are obligated to pay 5% of net sales on sales of certain diagnostic devices and the performance of services relating to thyroid cancer that incorporate technology developed and funded under an agreement between Asuragen and the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, subject to a maximum deduction of 3.5% for royalties paid to third parties. Both of the Asuragen License Agreement and the CPRIT License Agreement continue until terminated by (i) mutual agreement of the parties or (ii) either party in the event of a material breach of the respective agreement by the other party.\nIf we materially breach or fail to perform any provision under the CPRIT License Agreement, Asuragen will have the right to terminate our license from CPRIT, and upon the effective date of such termination, our right to practice the licensed technology would end. To the extent such licensed technology rights relate to our molecular diagnostic tests currently on the market, we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including attempting to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the technology licensed to us, but we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost to us or at all. Any uncured, material breach under these license agreements could result in our loss of rights to practice the technology licensed to us under these license agreements, and to the extent such rights and other technology relate to our molecular diagnostic tests currently on the market, it could have a material adverse effect on our sales and commercialization efforts for NGS-based thyroid and pancreatic cancer molecular diagnostic tests and other tests in development for thyroid cancer, and the sale of molecular diagnostic tests and the performance of certain services relating to thyroid cancer.\nUnder the agreement, neither party will be held responsible for a default or breach for failure or delay in performing its obligations when such failure or delay is caused by or results from events beyond reasonable control of the non-performing party, including fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, embargoes, shortages, epidemics or pandemics, quarantines war, acts of war, etc.\nClinical utility studies are important in demonstrating to both customers and payers a molecular diagnostic test\u2019s clinical relevance and value. If we are unable to identify collaborators willing to work with us to conduct clinical utility studies, or the results of those studies do not demonstrate that a molecular diagnostic test provides clinically meaningful information and value, commercial adoption of such test may be slow, which would negatively impact our business.\nClinical utility studies show when and how to use a molecular diagnostic clinical test and describe the particular clinical situations or settings in which it can be applied and the expected results. Clinical utility studies also show the impact of the molecular diagnostic test results on patient care and management. Clinical utility studies are typically performed with collaborating oncologists or other physicians at medical centers and hospitals, analogous to a clinical trial, and generally result in peer-reviewed publications. Sales and marketing representatives use these publications to demonstrate to customers how to use a molecular diagnostic clinical test, as well as why they should use it. These publications are also used with payers to obtain coverage for a molecular diagnostic test, helping to assure there is appropriate reimbursement. We will need to conduct additional studies for our molecular diagnostic tests and other diagnostic tests we plan to introduce, to increase the market adoption and obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement. Should we not be able to perform these studies, should the costs or length of time required for these studies exceed their value, or should their results not provide clinically meaningful data and value for oncologists and other physicians, adoption of our molecular diagnostic tests could be impaired, and we may not be able to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for them.\nWe rely on sole suppliers for some of the materials used in our tests and services, and we may not be able to find replacements or transition to alternative suppliers in a timely manner.\nWe rely on sole suppliers for certain materials that we use to perform our tests and services, including Asuragen, for our endocrine cancer diagnostic tests pursuant to our supply agreement with them. We also purchase reagents used in our tests and services from sole-source suppliers. While we have developed alternate sourcing strategies for these materials and vendors, we cannot be certain whether these strategies will be effective or the alternative sources will be available in a timely manner. If these suppliers can no longer provide us with the materials we need to perform our tests and services, if the materials do not meet our quality specifications, or if we cannot obtain acceptable substitute materials, an interruption in test processing and services could occur. Any such interruption may directly impact our revenue and cause us to incur higher costs. In particular, the continued spread of the coronavirus globally could materially and adversely impact our operations including without limitation our supply chain, which may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience problems in scaling our operations, or delays or reagent and supply shortages for our tests and services that could limit the growth of our revenue.\nIf we encounter difficulties in scaling our operations as a result of, among other things, quality control and quality assurance issues and availability of reagents and raw material supplies, we will likely experience reduced sales of our tests and services, increased repair or re-engineering costs, and defects and increased expenses due to switching to alternate suppliers, any of which would reduce our revenues and gross margins. Although we attempt to match our capabilities to estimates of marketplace demand, to the extent demand materially varies from our estimates, we may experience constraints in our operations and delivery capacity, which could adversely impact revenue in a given fiscal period. Should our need for raw materials and reagents used in our tests and services fluctuate, we could incur additional costs associated with either expediting or postponing delivery of those materials or reagents.\nIf we are unable to support demand for our tests and services, or any of our future tests, services or solutions, our business could suffer.\nAs demand for our tests and services grow, we will also need to continue to scale up our testing capacity and processing technology, expand customer service, billing and systems processes and enhance our internal quality assurance program. We will also need additional certified laboratory scientists and other scientific and technical personnel to process higher volumes of our tests and services. We cannot assure you that increases in scale, related improvements and quality assurance will be implemented successfully or that appropriate personnel will be available. Failure to implement necessary procedures, transition to new processes or hire the necessary personnel could result in higher costs of processing tests or inability to meet demand. There can be no assurance that we will be able to perform our testing and services on a timely basis at a level consistent with demand, or that our efforts to scale our operations will not negatively affect the quality of test results. If we encounter difficulty meeting market demand or quality standards, our reputation could be harmed and our future prospects and our business could suffer, causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDeveloping new tests and related services and solutions involves a lengthy and complex process, and we may not be able to commercialize on a timely basis, or at all, other tests, assays, services and solutions under development.\nDeveloping new tests, services and solutions will require us to devote considerable resources to research and development, which we may not be in a position to do. We may face challenges obtaining sufficient numbers of samples to validate a newly acquired or developed test or service. In order to develop and commercialize new tests and services, we need to:\n\u25cf expend significant funds to conduct substantial research and development;\n\u25cf conduct successful analytical and clinical studies;\n\u25cf scale our laboratory processes to accommodate new tests and services; and\n\u25cf build and maintain the commercial infrastructure to market and sell new tests and services.\nTypically, few research and development projects result in commercial products, and success in early clinical studies often is not replicated in later studies. At any point, we may abandon development of a test, service or solutions or we may be required to expend considerable resources repeating clinical studies, which would adversely affect the timing for generating revenue from such test, service or solution. If a clinical validation study fails to demonstrate the prospectively defined endpoints of the study or if we fail to sufficiently demonstrate analytical validity, we might choose to abandon the development of the test, service or solution which could harm our business. In addition, competitors may develop and commercialize new competing tests, services and solutions faster than us or at a lower cost, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to develop or acquire tests, services and solutions to keep pace with rapid technological, medical and scientific change, our operating results and competitive position in the market could be affected.\nRecently, there have been numerous advances in technologies relating to diagnostics, particularly diagnostics that are based on genomic information. These advances require us to continuously develop our technology and to work to develop new solutions to keep pace with evolving standards of care. Our clinical services and pharma services could become obsolete unless we continually innovate and expand our product offerings to include new clinical applications. If we are unable to develop or acquire new tests, services and solutions or to demonstrate the applicability of our tests and services for other diseases, our sales could decline and our competitive position could be harmed.\nIf we cannot enter into new clinical study collaborations, our product development and subsequent commercialization could be delayed.\nIn the past, we have entered into clinical study collaborations related to our tests and services, and our success in the future depends in part on our ability to enter into additional collaborations with highly regarded institutions. This can be difficult due to internal and external constraints placed on these organizations. Some organizations may limit the number of collaborations they have with any one company so as to not be perceived as biased or conflicted. Organizations may also have insufficient administrative and related infrastructure to enable collaboration with many companies at once, which can extend the time it takes to develop, negotiate and implement a collaboration. Moreover, it may take longer to obtain the samples we need which could delay our trials, publications, and product launches and reimbursement. Additionally, organizations often insist on retaining the rights to publish the clinical data resulting from the collaboration. The publication of clinical data in peer-reviewed journals is a crucial step in commercializing and obtaining reimbursement for our diagnostic tests, and our inability to control when and if results are published may delay or limit our ability to derive sufficient revenue from them.\nIf the FDA changes its enforcement policy as to LDTs or disagrees with our position that our clinical services tests are LDTs covered by the FDA\u2019s current enforcement discretion policy, we could be subject to a number of enforcement actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our clinical services and/or incur substantial costs and delays associated with trying to obtain pre-market clearance or approval and comply with applicable post-market requirements.\nClinical laboratory tests like our clinical services tests are regulated under CLIA as well as by applicable state laws and may also be subject to FDA regulation, depending on how the test is classified. For example, the FDA regulates in vitro diagnostic tests (also called in vitro devices or \u201cIVDs\u201d), specimen collection kits, analyte specific reagents (ASRs), and instruments used in conducting diagnostic testing. Most tests that qualify as LDTs are currently subject to enforcement discretion by the FDA, but there is substantial uncertainty regarding the scope of the FDA\u2019s enforcement discretion policy and the proper interpretation of the definition of LDTs (as set forth in the 2014 draft guidance described below, which defines LDTs as \u201cthose in vitro diagnostic devices (IVD) that are intended for clinical use and are designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory\u201d). In July 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents: \u201cFramework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests,\u201d which provides an overview of how the FDA would regulate LDTs through a risk-based approach, and \u201cFDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests\u201d, which provides guidance on how the FDA intends to collect information on existing LDTs, including adverse event reports. Pursuant to the Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance, LDT manufacturers will be subject to medical device registration, listing, and adverse event reporting requirements. LDT manufacturers will be required to either submit a pre-market application and receive the FDA\u2019s approval before an LDT may be marketed or submit a pre-market notification in advance of marketing unless subject to continued enforcement discretion. The Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance states that within six months after the guidance documents are finalized, all laboratories will be required to give notice to the FDA and provide basic information concerning the nature of the LDTs offered.\nOn January 13, 2017, the FDA released a discussion paper on LDTs outlining a possible, substantially-revised risk-based approach for FDA and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, oversight of LDTs. According to the 2017 discussion paper, most previously marketed LDTs would not be expected to comply with most or all FDA oversight requirements (grandfathering), except for adverse event and malfunction reporting. In addition, certain new and significantly modified LDTs would not be expected to comply with pre-market review unless the agency determines certain tests could lead to patient harm. Since many LDTs currently on the market would be grandfathered in, pre-market review of new and significantly modified LDTs could be phased-in over a four-year period, as opposed to the nine years proposed in the Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance. In addition, tests introduced after the effective date, but before their phase-in date, could continue to be offered during pre-market review.\nThe discussion paper notes that the FDA will focus on analytical and clinical validity as the basis for marketing authorization. The FDA anticipates laboratories that already conduct proper validation should not be expected to experience new costs for validating their tests to support marketing authorization and laboratories that conduct appropriate evaluations would not have to collect additional data to demonstrate analytical validity for FDA clearance or approval. The evidence of the analytical and clinical validity of all LDTs would be made publicly available. LDTs would be encouraged to submit prospective change protocols in their pre-market submission that outline specific types of anticipated changes, the procedures that will be followed to implement them and the criteria that will be met prior to implementation.\nIn March 2017, members of Congress posted a discussion draft of \u201cThe Diagnostics Accuracy and Innovation Act\u201d (DAIA). The discussion draft included language that, if enacted, would have established a new regulatory framework for the oversight of in vitro clinical tests (\u201cIVCTs\u201d) which include LDTs. In 2020, members of Congress introduced \u201cThe Verifying Accurate, Leading-edge IVCT Development (VALID) Act\u201d; this bill was re-introduced in substantially similar form in June 2021. If enacted, VALID would create a risk-based approach to regulate IVCTs while grandfathering many existing IVCTs. The new regulatory framework will include quality control and post-market reporting requirements. Each test will be classified as high-risk or low-risk. Pre-market review will be required for high-risk tests. To market a high-risk IVCT, reasonable assurance of analytical and clinical validity for the intended use must be established. Under VALID, a precertification process would be established which will allow a laboratory to establish that the facilities, methods, and controls used in the development of certain IVCTs meet quality system requirements. If pre-certified, low-risk IVCTs it develops will not be subject to pre-market review. The new regulatory framework will include quality control and post-market reporting requirements. The FDA will have the authority to withdraw from the market IVCTs if it is reasonably possible that such tests will cause serious adverse health consequences (among other criteria). We cannot predict whether this bill will become law or the ultimate impact of its passage, or other legislative or regulatory changes, would have on our business. If the FDA implements a new framework for enforcement of its regulations against LDTs, our existing products that are classified as LDTs, if any, and/or any of our future LDTs we seek to develop and market for clinical use, we may be required to obtain pre-certification or approval before continuing to market such tests in the U.S. We may not be able to obtain such pre-certifications or approvals on a timely basis or at all. Our business could be negatively impacted as a result of commercial delay that may be caused by any new requirements.\nIf we are required to submit applications for our currently-marketed clinical services tests, we may be required to conduct additional studies, which may be time-consuming and costly and could result in our currently-marketed tests being withdrawn from the market. Continued compliance with the FDA\u2019s regulations would increase the cost of conducting our clinical services, and subject us to heightened regulation by the FDA and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, such as fines, product suspensions, warning letters, recalls, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions. Any other regulatory or legislative proposals that would increase general FDA oversight of clinical laboratories and LDTs could negatively impact our business if additional requirements are imposed. We are monitoring developments and anticipate that our clinical services products will be able to comply with requirements that are ultimately imposed by the FDA. In the meantime, we maintain our CLIA accreditation, which permits the use of LDTs for diagnostics purposes.\nSimilarly, notwithstanding any change in existing enforcement policies, if the FDA determines that any of our clinical services tests are IVDs, rather than LDTs and, accordingly, seeks to enforce the applicable medical device regulations against us, we could be subject to a wide range of penalties and would likely be prohibited from continuing to offer the applicable tests in interstate commerce until we have obtained FDA approval or clearance through the Premarket Approval (PMA) process or the 510(k) process, respectively, as applicable. Additionally, we could be subject to enforcement for noncompliance with the FDA\u2019s regulations on marketing and promotional communications, manufacturing, quality and safety standards, labeling, storage, registration and listing, recordkeeping, adverse event reporting, and any other regulations applicable to IVDs. Any adverse enforcement action against us may have a material adverse effect on our clinical services and results of operations.\nIf we are sued for product liability or errors and omissions liability related to our tests and services, we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources.\nThe marketing, sale and use of our tests and services could lead to product liability claims if someone were to allege that the test or service failed to perform as it was designed. We may also be subject to liability for errors in the results we provide to physicians or for a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide. A product liability or errors and omissions liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming for us to defend. Although we maintain product liability and errors and omissions insurance, we cannot be certain that our insurance would fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against these types of claims or any judgments, fines or settlement costs arising out of such claims. Any product liability or errors and omissions liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could cause injury to our reputation or cause us to suspend sales of our products and solutions. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws or payer regulations could result in our being excluded from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, or other governmental payer programs, subject to fines, penalties, and repayment obligations, decrease our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition for our clinical services.\nThe Medicare program is administered by CMS, which, like the states that administer their respective state Medicaid programs, imposes extensive and detailed requirements on diagnostic services providers, including, but not limited to, rules that govern how we structure our relationships with physicians, how and when we submit reimbursement claims and how we provide our specialized diagnostic services. In addition, federal and state laws prohibit fraudulent billing and provide for the recovery of overpayments. In particular, if we fail to comply with federal and state documentation, coding and billing rules, we could be subject to liability under the federal False Claims Act, including criminal and/or civil penalties, loss of licenses and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The False Claims Act prohibits individuals and companies from knowingly submitting false claims for payments to, or improperly retaining overpayments from, the government. Private payers also have complex documentation, coding, and billing rules, and can bring civil actions against laboratories. Our failure to comply with applicable Medicare, Medicaid and other third party payer rules could result in liability under the False Claims Act, our inability to participate in a governmental payer program, recoupment or returning funds already paid to us, civil monetary penalties, criminal penalties and/or limitations on the operational function of our laboratory, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Pharma Services\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of our pharma services business or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating the pharma services business.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of the pharma services business depends, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate it successfully. The combination and integration of two independent operations is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we have been required and are continuing to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of our pharma services with our clinical services practices and operations. The integration process, which includes moving laboratory locations, may disrupt the operations and, if implemented ineffectively or if impacted by unforeseen negative economic or market conditions or other factors, we may not realize the full anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two operations to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisition could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, the overall integration of the operations may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and diversion of management\u2019s attention. The difficulties of combining the operations include but are not limited to:\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention from the management of daily operations to integration matters;\n\u25cf difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from combining our pharma services with our clinical services operations;\n\u25cf difficulties entering new markets or new laboratory or data management services where we have no or limited direct prior experience;\n\u25cf difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;\n\u25cf difficulties in the assimilation of employees and in the retention of key employees;\n\u25cf difficulties in retaining employees who may be vital to the integration of departments, information technology systems, including accounting systems, technologies, books and records, and procedures, and maintaining uniform standards, such as internal accounting controls, procedures, and policies;\n\u25cf difficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures and business practices;\n\u25cf difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;\n\u25cf potential deterioration in the sales and revenues of the tests and services of our pharma services;\n\u25cf costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities;\n\u25cf successfully managing relationships with our new strategic partners, suppliers and customer base;\n\u25cf challenges in maintaining existing, and establishing new business relationships; and\n\u25cf challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and our results of operations. In addition, even if the operations of our clinical services operations and our pharma services are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all.\nFurthermore, additional unanticipated costs which may be incurred in the continuing integration of operations or unanticipated increases in expenses unrelated to the acquisition of our pharma services may offset the expected benefits from the acquisition of our pharma services. In addition, our acquisition of the pharma services business has resulted in the incurrence of additional amortization expenses related to intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Further, the acquisition of the pharma services business resulted in the Company recording significant goodwill and other assets, and we may be required to incur impairment charges, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Since the acquisition, we have also undergone several cost-cutting initiatives with our pharma services business, including reductions in headcount. Further, during Fiscal 2021, the Company experienced a fairly significant decrease in volume within pharma services. The decrease in revenue within pharma services was approximately 32% from the comparable prior year period. Such revenue headwinds may continue in future periods. As such, all of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the pharma services business acquisition and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, we cannot be certain that the integration process and resulting combined operations will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the acquisition.\nIf we are unable to increase sales of the tests and services in our pharma services or to successfully develop and commercialize other proprietary tests in our pharma services, we may be unable to achieve profitability.\nOur pharma services provide pharmaceutical and biotech companies, universities and contract research organizations performing clinical trials with lab testing services for patient stratification and treatment selection through an extensive suite of molecular- and biomarker-based testing services, DNA- and RNA- extraction and customized assay development and trial design consultation. It is unclear whether we will be able to maintain and grow the number of customers who will avail themselves of our tests and services, or how regular a flow of business we will be able to obtain from existing customers. If we are unable to increase sales of our tests and services or to successfully develop, validate and commercialize other diagnostic tests and services, our pharma services may not produce sufficient revenues to become profitable.\nIf pharmaceutical and biotech companies, universities and contract research organizations performing clinical trials decide not to use our diagnostic tests and services, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain our pharma services.\nTo generate demand for our pharma services, we need to educate pharmaceutical and biotech companies, universities and contract research organizations performing clinical trials on the utility of our tests and services to improve the outcomes of clinical trials for new oncology drugs and more rapidly advance targeted therapies through the clinical development process through published papers, presentations at scientific conferences and one-on-one education sessions by members of our sales force. We may need to hire additional commercial, scientific, technical and other personnel to support this process. If we cannot convince pharmaceutical and biotech companies, universities and contract research organizations performing clinical trials to order our diagnostic tests and services or other future tests and services we develop, we will likely be unable to create demand for our tests and services in sufficient volume for us to achieve sustained profitability of our pharma services.\nAs a result of our pharma services, our quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations and may be difficult to forecast.\nThe nature of the services of our pharma services is that they tend to come in relatively large projects but episodically, rather than providing steady sources of revenues. The timing, size and duration of our contracts with our customers depend on the size, pace and duration of such customer\u2019s clinical trial, over which we have no control and sometimes limited visibility. In addition, our expense levels are based, in part, on expectation of future revenue levels. A shortfall in expected revenue could, therefore, result in a disproportionate decrease in our net income. As a result, our quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations and may be difficult to forecast.\nIf we fail to perform our pharma services in accordance with contractual and regulatory requirements, and ethical considerations, we could be subject to significant costs or liability.\nThrough our pharma services offerings, we contract with pharmaceutical and biotech companies, universities and contract research organizations performing clinical trials to perform lab testing services for patient stratification and treatment selection through an extensive suite of molecular- and biomarker-based testing services, DNA- and RNA- extraction and customized assay development and trial design consultation. Such services are complex and subject to contractual requirements, regulatory standards and ethical considerations. If we fail to perform our services in accordance with these requirements, standards, and considerations regulatory authorities may take action against us or our customers. Such actions may include failure of such regulatory authority to grant marketing approval of our customers\u2019 products, imposition of holds or delays, suspension or withdrawal of clearances or approvals, rejection of data collected, laboratory license revocation, product recalls, operational restrictions, civil or criminal penalties or prosecutions, damages or fines. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nThe loss of members of our senior management team or our inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nAs a small company with less than 200 employees, the success of our business depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of members of our senior management team, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and others in key management positions. During January and February 2021, we experienced turnover in our chief executive officer and chief financial officer positions. The efforts of these persons will be critical to us as we continue to grow our clinical services and develop and/or acquire additional molecular diagnostic tests, and increase or maintain pharma services tests and service revenue or to successfully develop and commercialize other pharma services proprietary tests and services. If we were to lose one or more of these key employees, we may experience difficulties in competing effectively, developing our technologies and implementing our business strategy. In addition, our commercial laboratory operations depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists, including licensed clinical laboratory scientists. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified scientists and technicians in the future due to the competition for qualified personnel, and we may have to pay higher salaries to attract and retain qualified personnel. We may also be at a disadvantage in recruiting and retaining key personnel as our small size, limited resources, and limited liquidity may be viewed as providing a less stable environment, with fewer opportunities than would be the case at one of our larger competitors. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that could adversely affect our ability to support our clinical laboratory and commercialization.\nIf we lose the support of key opinion leaders or KOL\u2019s, it may limit our revenue growth from our tests or services and our ability to achieve profitability.\nWe have established relationships with leading oncology opinion leaders at premier cancer institutions and oncology networks. If these key opinion leaders determine that our existing products and services or other products and services that we develop are not clinically effective, that alternative technologies are more effective, or if they elect to use internally developed products, we would encounter significant difficulty validating our testing platform, driving adoption, or establishing our tests as a standard of care, which would limit our revenue growth and our ability to achieve profitability.\nIf we cannot maintain our current relationships, or enter into new relationships, with biopharmaceutical companies to leverage our bioinformatics data, we may be unable to recognize revenues from biopharmaceutical companies and our product development could be delayed.\nWe have limited experience in marketing and selling our products, and if we are unable to expand our direct sales and marketing force to adequately address our customer\u2019s needs, our business may be adversely affected.\nAlthough we have been selling commercial products since 2014, genomic diagnostics and pharma services are new areas of science, and we continue to focus and refine our efforts to sell, market and receive reimbursement for our clinical service products and to leverage our bioinformatics data. We may not be able to market, sell, or distribute our existing products or services or other products or services we may develop effectively enough to support our planned growth.\nOur future sales will depend in large part on our ability to develop, and substantially expand, our sales force and to increase the scope of our marketing efforts. Our target market of physicians is a large and diverse market. As a result, we believe it is necessary to develop a sales force that includes sales representatives with specific technical backgrounds. We will also need to attract and develop marketing personnel with industry expertise. Competition for such employees is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel or be able to build an efficient and effective sales and marketing force, which could negatively impact sales and market acceptance of our products and services and limit our revenue growth and potential profitability.\nOur expected future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, and integrate additional employees. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our products and leverage our data and to compete effectively will depend in part on our ability to manage this potential future growth effectively, without compromising quality.\nIf our sales force is less successful than anticipated, our business expansion plans could suffer and our ability to generate revenues could be diminished. In addition, we have limited history selling our clinical services tests on a direct basis and operating our pharma services, and leveraging our bioinformatics data and our limited history makes forecasting difficult.\nIf our sales force is not successful, or new additions to our sales team fail to gain traction among our customers, we may not be able to increase market awareness and sales of our molecular diagnostic tests and pharma services. If we fail to establish our clinical services tests and pharma services in the marketplace, it could have a negative effect on our ability to sell subsequent products or services and hinder the desired expansion of our business. We have growing, however limited, historical experience forecasting the direct sales of our clinical services products, and no prior history operating our pharma services before our acquisition of pharma services in 2019. Our ability to produce product quantities that meet customer demand is dependent upon our ability to forecast accurately and plan production accordingly.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully in the markets our clinical services and pharma services operate in, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue or achieve profitability.\nWe compete with physicians and the medical community who use traditional methods to diagnose gastrointestinal, endocrine and lung cancers and to conduct clinical trials. In many cases, practice guidelines in the United States have recommended non-molecular testing like cytology or diagnostic surgery to determine if a patient\u2019s condition is malignant or benign. As a result, we believe that we will need to continue to educate physicians and the medical community on the value and benefits of our clinical services tests in order to impact clinical practices. In addition, we face competition from other companies that offer diagnostic tests. Specifically, in regard to our thyroid diagnostic tests, Veracyte has thyroid nodule cancer diagnostic tests which are currently on the market that compete with our ThyGeNEXT\u00ae and ThyraMIR\u00ae tests. Quest currently offers Veracyte\u2019s tests via a co-marketing agreement, and CBL is offering a diagnostic test performed via the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) that analyzes genetic alterations using next-generation sequencing mutation panel for pancreatic cysts. While we do not believe we currently have significant direct competition for PancraGEN\u00ae in the gastrointestinal market, technology such as a next-generation sequencing mutation panel could in the future lead to increased competition.\nIt is also possible that we face future competition from laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, developed by commercial laboratories such as Quest and/or other diagnostic companies developing new molecular diagnostic tests or technologies. Furthermore, we may be subject to competition as a result of the new, unforeseen technologies that can be developed by our competitors in the gastrointestinal and endocrine cancer molecular diagnostic testing space. To compete successfully, we must be able to demonstrate, among other things, that our test results are accurate and cost effective, and we must secure a meaningful level of reimbursement for our tests. Since our clinical services began in 2014, many of our potential competitors have stronger brand recognition and greater financial capabilities than we do. Others may develop a test with a lower price than ours that could be viewed by physicians and payers as functionally equivalent to our molecular diagnostic tests or offer a test at prices designed to promote market penetration, which could force us to lower the price of our clinical services tests and affect our ability to achieve and maintain profitability. If we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, we may be unable to increase market acceptance of our clinical services tests and overall sales, which could prevent us from increasing our revenue or achieving profitability and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. As we add new clinical services tests and other products and services, we will likely face many of these same competitive risks that we do currently.\nWith respect to our pharma services, we also face competition from companies that currently offer or are developing products to profile genes, gene expression or protein biomarkers in various cancers. Precision medicine is a new area of science, and we cannot predict what tests others will develop that may compete with or provide results superior to the results we are able to achieve with the tests we develop. Our competitors for our pharma services include public companies such as NeoGenomics and many private companies.\nIf we cannot license rights to use third-party technologies on reasonable terms, we may not be able to commercialize new products or services in the future.\nIn the future, we may license third-party technology to develop or commercialize new products or offer new services. In return for the use of a third-party\u2019s technology, we may agree to pay the licensor royalties based on sales of our solutions. Royalties are a component of cost of revenue and affect the margins on our solutions. We may also need to negotiate licenses to patents and patent applications after introducing a commercial product. Our business may suffer if we are unable to enter into the necessary licenses on acceptable terms, or at all, if any necessary licenses are subsequently terminated, if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license or fail to prevent infringement by third parties, or if the licensed patents or other rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable.\nUnfavorable results of legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in or outside the ordinary course of business. The results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. If we do not prevail in the legal proceedings, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf a catastrophe strikes any of our laboratories or if any of our laboratories becomes inoperable for any other reason, we will be unable to perform our testing and pharma services and our business will be harmed.\nThe laboratories and equipment we use to perform our tests and services would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to replace and qualify for use if they became inoperable. Our facilities may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, power outages, and health epidemics or pandemics, including the outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19), which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our testing or services for some period of time or to receive and store samples. The inability to perform our tests or services for even a short period of time, including due to disruption in staffing, supplies, distribution, or transport or temporary closures related to an outbreak of disease such as COVID-19, may result in the loss of customers or harm our reputation, and we may be unable to regain those customers in the future. Although we maintain insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, COVID-19 has materially and adversely impacted our operations particularly during portions of 2020. Further continued spread of COVID-19 globally and resulting travel and other restrictions that may be imposed could negatively impact our ability to obtain raw materials needed for manufacture of our clinical services testing, our ability to provide testing and our pharma services to patients, our financial condition and our results of operation. The extent to which COVID-19 and global efforts to contain its spread will impact our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, and include the duration, severity and scope of the outbreak and the actions taken to contain or treat the COVID-19 outbreak.\nIf we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes contamination or injury, we could be liable for resulting damages.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations governing the use, discharge, storage, handling and disposal of biological material, chemicals and waste. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, remediation costs and any related penalties or fines, and any liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become significant, and our failure to comply may result in substantial fines or other consequences, and either could have a significant impact on our operating results.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions to us or our third-party service providers could compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nOur business requires that we and our third-party service providers collect and store sensitive data, including PHI, personally identifiable information such as genetic information or credit card information about patients or other individuals, and our proprietary business and financial information. We must comply with the HIPAA and HITECH privacy, security, and breach notification regulations with respect to PHI in our capacity as a covered entity and business associate, and with consumer protection and consumer privacy laws that apply to our processing of this sensitive data, which may increase our operational costs. Furthermore, the privacy, security, and breach notification regulations implemented under HIPAA and HITECH as well as other federal and state consumer protection and consumer privacy laws and regulations that may apply to us provide for significant fines and other penalties, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties, for non-compliance. We face a number of risks relative to our protection of, and our service providers\u2019 protection of, this critical information, other personally identifiable information, and our proprietary business and financial information, including loss of access, fraudulent modifications, inappropriate disclosure and inappropriate access, as well as risks associated with our ability to identify and audit such events. The secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or otherwise breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other activities. If such event would occur and cause interruptions in our operations, our networks would be compromised and the information we store on those networks could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, modified without our knowledge, lost or stolen. In 2017, we discovered malware installed on certain servers. After an internal investigation, we do not believe that any PHI or other sensitive data on the affected servers was accessed or compromised. We removed the malware, and enhanced our cybersecurity procedures.\nAdditionally, we engage third-party contractors who, insofar as they are our business associates, are contractually and legally obligated to safeguard and maintain the confidentiality of any PHI that they create, receive, maintain, transmit, use, or disclose on our behalf. Unauthorized persons may be able to gain access to PHI stored by such third-party contractors, including in their computer networks. Any wrongful use or disclosure of PHI by us or our third-party contractors, including disclosure due to data theft or unauthorized access to our or our third-party contractors\u2019 computer networks, could subject us to fines or penalties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Although HIPAA and HITECH and their implementing regulations do not expressly provide for a private right of damages, they permit state attorneys general to bring civil actions and obtain damages on behalf of state residents for violations, and enjoin further violations, of the privacy and security regulations implemented under HIPAA. We also could incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information by us or our third-party contractors. Unauthorized access, loss, modification or dissemination could disrupt our operations, including our ability to process tests, provide test results, bill payers or patients, process claims, provide customer assistance services, conduct research and development activities, collect, process and prepare company financial information, provide information about our solution and other patient and physician education and outreach efforts through our website, or manage the administrative aspects of our business and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer, health-related or other data protection laws in the United States are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux, particularly as more states enact comprehensive consumer privacy laws. It is possible that these various laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices, systems and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.\nWe may need to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nWe are a small company with less than 200 employees. We may increase the number of employees in the future depending on the progress and growth of our business. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, attract, retain, motivate and integrate additional employees with the necessary skills to support the growing complexities of our business. Rapid and significant growth may place strain on our administrative, financial and operational infrastructure. Our future financial performance and our ability to sell or promote our existing tests and services and develop and commercialize new tests and services and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to:\n\u25cf manage our clinical studies effectively;\n\u25cf integrate additional management, administrative, manufacturing and regulatory personnel;\n\u25cf maintain sufficient administrative, accounting and management information systems and controls; and\n\u25cf hire and train additional qualified personnel.\nWe may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could harm our financial results. We may need to reduce the size of our organization in order to become profitable and we may experience difficulties in managing these reductions.\nRisks Related to Regulation within our Markets\nIf we fail to comply with federal, state and foreign laboratory licensing requirements, we could lose the ability to perform our tests or experience disruptions to our business.\nWe are subject to CLIA regulations, a Federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of any disease, or impairment of, or the assessment of the health of, human beings. CLIA regulations mandate specific personnel qualifications, facilities administration, quality systems, inspections and proficiency testing. CLIA certification is also required in order for us to be eligible to bill federal and state healthcare programs, as well as many private third-party payers, for our molecular diagnostic tests. To renew these certifications, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years. Moreover, CLIA inspectors may make random inspections of our clinical reference laboratories. We are also required to maintain State licenses to conduct testing in our Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania laboratory. Pennsylvania law requires that we maintain a license, and establish standards for the day-to-day operation of our clinical reference laboratory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In addition, our Pittsburgh laboratory is required to be licensed by certain states, including California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island. New York law requires us to obtain test-specific approval before offering our tests as LDT. California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island laws also mandate proficiency testing for laboratories licensed under the laws of each respective State regardless of whether such laboratories are located in California, Maryland, New York or Rhode Island. If we were unable to obtain or maintain our CLIA certificate for our laboratories, whether as a result of revocation, suspension or limitation, we would no longer be able to perform our current clinical services and pharma services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we were to lose our licenses issued by States where we are required to hold licenses, if such licenses expired or were not renewed, or if we failed to obtain and maintain a State license that we are required to hold, we may be subject to significant fines, penalties and liability, and may be forced to cease testing (if Pennsylvania) or cease testing specimens from those States (if California, New York, Maryland, or Rhode Island), which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. New molecular diagnostic tests and pharma services we may develop may be subject to new requirements by governmental bodies, including state governments, and we may not be able to offer our new molecular diagnostic tests or pharma services in such jurisdictions until such requirements are met.\nLegislation reforming the U.S. healthcare system may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nPPACA made changes that significantly affected the pharmaceutical, medical device and clinical laboratory industries. For example, PPACA includes coordination and promotion of research on comparative clinical effectiveness of different technologies and procedures, initiatives to revise Medicare payment methodologies, such as bundling of payments across the continuum of care by providers and physicians, and initiatives to promote quality indicators in payment methodologies. PPACA also includes significant new fraud and abuse measures, including required disclosures of financial arrangements with physicians, lower thresholds for violations and increasing potential penalties for such violations. The effect of PPACA and any potential changes that may be necessitated by the legislation is uncertain, any of which may potentially affect our business.\nOur current position is that we do not meet the definition of an \u201cApplicable Manufacturer\u201d under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act of the PPACA and are therefore not subject to the disclosure or tax requirements contained in PPACA. If the government were to reach a different conclusion, our failure to disclose could result in significant monetary penalties and potential claims from certain third parties.\nPPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product or service, and could seriously harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may compromise our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. At the same time, there have been significant ongoing efforts to repeal, revise, or replace PPACA; however, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law in 2021.\nPresident Biden has used executive orders to undo certain changes to the PPACA made by the Trump administration and has indicated it will advocate for legislation to build on the PPACA. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. We expect that changes or additions to the PPACA, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry.\nFor example, Medicare payment rates have been - and in the future, will continue to be, to varying extents, subject to sequestration. Reductions resulting from the Congressional sequester are applied to total claim payments made; however, they do not currently result in a rebasing of the negotiated or established Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement rates.\nState legislation on reimbursement applies to Medicaid reimbursement and Managed Medicaid reimbursement rates within that state. Some states have passed or proposed legislation that would revise reimbursement methodology for clinical laboratory payment rates under those Medicaid programs.\nIn April 2014, President Obama signed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, or PAMA, which included a substantial new payment system for clinical laboratory tests under the CLFS. Under PAMA, CLFS payment rates are based upon the weighted median of private payor rates for each type of laboratory test. To calculate these rates, PAMA requires CLIA-certified laboratories that receive a majority of their Medicare revenue from payments made under the CLFS and the Physician Fee Schedule, and receive at least $12,500 in CLFS revenue, within the 6-month reporting period, to report private payor rates and volumes for their tests with specific CPT codes based on final payments made during a 6-month period of data collection (from January 1 through June 30 of the applicable year). For most laboratory tests, the CLFS is updated every three years, but rates are updated annually for Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Tests, or ADLTs. The first private payor rate-based CLFS was based on data collected from January 1 through June 30, 2016, and, following an initial, one-year delay became effective on January 1, 2018. CMS published final rules implementing these changes in 2016 and 2018.\nUnder the revised Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing was reduced for most tests in 2018, 2019, and 2020. PAMA (as revised) calls for further revisions of the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule for years after 2022, based on future surveys of market rates. Further reductions in reimbursement may result from such revisions.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, as amended by the Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act, revised payment reductions and the data reporting schedule for CDLTs that are not ADLTs. Under these laws, the next data reporting period is January 1, 2023 through March 31, 2023, and will be based upon the data collected during the January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019 period. Any reductions to payment rates resulting from the new methodology are limited to 10% per test per year in each of the years 2018 through 2020 and to 15% per test per year in each of the years 2023 through 2025. Payments will not be reduced for 2021 or 2022 for CDLTs.\nWe cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level or in countries outside of the United States in which we may do business, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us. There is additional uncertainty in light of the current Presidential administration. The taxes imposed by federal legislation, cost reduction measures and the expansion in the role of the U.S. government in the healthcare industry may result in decreased revenue, lower reimbursement by payers for our tests or reduced medical procedure volumes, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nComplying with numerous statutes and regulations pertaining to our clinical and pharma services is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties.\nWe are subject to regulation by both the federal government and the governments of the states in which we conduct our operations. The federal and state laws which may apply to us include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as supplemented by various other statutes;\n\u25cf CLIA and state licensing requirements;\n\u25cf Manufacturing and promotion laws;\n\u25cf Medicare and Medicaid billing and payment regulations applicable to clinical laboratories;\n\u25cf The Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (EKRA), which prohibits the solicitation, receipt, payment or offer of any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate) directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for referring a patient or patronage to a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory for services covered by both government and private payers;\n\u25cf The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute (and state equivalents), which prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program;\n\u25cf The Federal physician self-referral law, commonly referred to as the \u201cStark Law,\u201d (and state equivalents), which prohibits a physician from making a referral for certain designated health services covered by the Medicare program, including laboratory and pathology services, if the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship with the entity providing the designated health services, unless the financial relationship falls within an applicable exception to the prohibition;\n\u25cf HIPAA, which established comprehensive federal standards with respect to the privacy and security of PHI and requirements for the use of certain standardized electronic transactions, and amendments made in 2013 to HIPAA under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which strengthen and expand HIPAA privacy and security compliance requirements, increase penalties for violators, extend enforcement authority to state attorneys general, and impose requirements for breach notification;\n\u25cf The FTC Act and various state consumer privacy laws, which require regulated entities to take reasonable steps to safeguard the personal information of consumers, minimize its use and provide consumers with certain rights as to their personal data such as the right to correct or delete their personal information;\n\u25cf The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies;\n\u25cf The Federal False Claims Act (and state equivalents), which imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government;\n\u25cf The federal transparency requirements under the PPACA, including the provisions commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u25cf Other federal and state fraud and abuse laws, prohibitions on self-referral and kickbacks, fee-splitting restrictions, prohibitions on the provision of products at no or discounted cost to induce physician or patient adoption, and false claims acts, transparency, reporting, and disclosure requirements, which may extend to services reimbursable by any third-party payer, including private insurers;\n\u25cf The prohibition on reassignment of Medicare claims, which, subject to certain exceptions, precludes the reassignment of Medicare claims to any other party;\n\u25cf The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, which requires us to report private payer rates and test volumes for specific CPT codes on a triennial basis and imposes penalties for failures to report, omissions, or misrepresentations;\n\u25cf The rules regarding billing for diagnostic tests reimbursable by the Medicare program, which prohibit a physician or other supplier from marking up the price of the technical component or professional component of a diagnostic test ordered by the physician or other supplier and supervised or performed by a physician who does not \u201cshare a practice\u201d with the billing physician or supplier; and\n\u25cf State laws that prohibit other specified practices related to billing such as billing physicians for testing that they order, waiving coinsurance, co-payments, deductibles, and other amounts owed by patients, and billing a State Medicaid program at a price that is higher than what is charged to other payers.\nIn recent years U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices have increased scrutiny of the healthcare industry, as have Congress, the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of the Inspector General and the Department of Defense. These bodies have all issued subpoenas and other requests for information to conduct investigations of, and commenced civil and criminal litigation against, healthcare companies based on financial arrangements with health care providers, regulatory compliance, product promotional practices and documentation, and coding and billing practices. Whistleblowers have filed numerous qui tam lawsuits against healthcare companies under the federal and state False Claims Acts in recent years, in part because the whistleblower can receive a portion of the government\u2019s recovery under such suits.\nThe growth of our business may increase the potential of violating these laws, regulations or our internal policies and procedures. The risk of our being found in violation of these or other laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Violations of federal or state regulations may incur investigation or enforcement action by the FDA, Department of Justice, State agencies, or other legal authorities, and may result in substantial civil, criminal, or other sanctions. Any action brought against us for violation of these or other laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines, we could be required to refund payments received by us, we could face possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal or state healthcare programs and we could even be required to cease our operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure to comply with federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to our payment practices could result in substantial penalties.\nWe retain healthcare practitioners as key opinion leaders providing consultation in various aspects of our business, maintain a sales force, and contract for marketing services. These arrangements, like any arrangement that includes compensation to a healthcare provider or potential referral source, may trigger federal or state anti-kickback, Stark Law liability, and False Claims Act liability. There are no guarantees that the federal or state governments will find that these arrangements are designed properly or that they do not trigger liability under federal and state laws. Under existing laws, all arrangements must be commercially reasonable and compensation must be fair market value. These terms require some subjective analysis. Safe harbors in the anti-kickback laws do not necessarily equate to exceptions in the Stark Law, and there is no guarantee that the government will agree with our payment practices with respect to the relationships between our laboratories and the healthcare providers, sales force members, or other parties. A failure to comply with Federal and State laws and regulations pertaining to our payment practices could result in substantial penalties and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, federal law prohibits any entity from offering or transferring to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration that the entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof) and transfers of items or services for free or for other than fair market value. Entities found in violation may be liable for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act. Further, federal and state anti-kickback statutes or similar laws may be implicated by arrangements with patients to waive, reduce, or limit copays or other payment amounts, such as our Patient Assistance Program. Third-party payers, including commercial payers and government payers, may prohibit, limit, or restrict certain financial arrangements with patients. Violation of these laws or payment policies could result in significant fines, penalties, liability, recoupment, and exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn 2018, the U.S. enacted the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act, or EKRA, as part of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (SUPPORT Act). EKRA is an all-payer anti-kickback law that makes it a criminal offense to pay any remuneration to induce referrals to, or in exchange for, patients using the services of a recovery home, a substance use clinical treatment facility, or laboratory. Although it appears that EKRA was intended to reach patient brokering and similar arrangements to induce patronage of substance use recovery and treatment, the language in EKRA is broadly written. The term \u201claboratory\u201d is defined broadly and without reference to any connection to substance use disorder treatment. EKRA is a criminal statute and violations can result in fines of up to $200,000, up to 10 years in prison, or both, per violation. As drafted, EKRA prohibits incentive compensation to sales employees, a practice that is common in the industry.\nOur business activities may be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.\nOur business activities may be subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the U.K. Bribery Act. The FCPA generally prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, potentially including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. Recently, the SEC and Department of Justice have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies. There is no certainty that all of our employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators, or those of our affiliates, will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, particularly given the high level of complexity of these laws. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, the closing down of our facilities, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.\nChanges in governmental regulation could negatively impact our business operations and increase our costs.\nThe pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare industries are subject to a high degree of governmental regulation. Significant changes in these regulations affecting our business could result in the imposition of additional restrictions on our business, additional costs to us in providing our tests or services to our customers or otherwise negatively impact our business operations. Changes in governmental regulations mandating price controls and limitations on patient access to our products could also reduce, eliminate or otherwise negatively impact our sales. Additional changes may be forthcoming in light of the current Presidential administration.\nRisks Relating To Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property effectively, our business would be harmed.\nWe rely on patent protection as well as trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights protection and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us and we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property. While we apply for patents covering our products and technologies and uses thereof, we may fail to apply for patents on important products and technologies in a timely fashion or at all, or we may fail to apply for patents in relevant jurisdictions. Others could seek to design around our current or future patented technologies. We may not be successful in defending any challenges made against our patents or patent applications. On January 16, 2018, we were notified that an Opposition had been filed against EP patent #2772550 alleging that the patent is invalid. On February 25, 2019, the European Patent Office Opposition Division issued a decision revoking the patent on grounds that the claims were not supported by a valid basis. On April 25, 2019, we filed a Notice of Appeal challenging the European Patent Office Opposition Division and we are waiting for the appeal to be decided. Any successful third-party challenge to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents and increased competition to our business. The outcome of patent litigation, such as oppositions or post-grant reviews can be uncertain and any attempt by us to enforce our patent rights against others may not be successful, or, if successful, may take substantial time and result in substantial cost, and may divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nMonitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate. If we were to enforce a claim that a third-party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, it would be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable. Further, competitors could willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that arguably fall outside of our intellectual property rights. Others may independently develop similar or alternative products and technologies or replicate any of our products and technologies. If our intellectual property does not adequately protect us against competitors\u2019 products and methods, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business and the results of our operations. To the extent our intellectual property offers inadequate protection, or is found to be invalid or unenforceable, we would be exposed to a greater risk of competition. If our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage of our competitors\u2019 products, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our overall business. Both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our molecular diagnostic tests.\nAs is the case with other companies operating in our industry, our success is somewhat dependent on intellectual property, particularly on obtaining and enforcing patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents of molecular diagnostics tests, like our molecular diagnostic tests in our PancraGEN\u00ae and miRInform\u00ae platforms (including ThyGeNEXT\u00ae), involves both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. From time-to-time the U.S. Supreme Court, other Federal courts, the U.S. Congress or the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, may change the standards of patentability and any such changes could have a negative impact on our business. For instance, on October 30, 2008, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision that methods or processes cannot be patented unless they are tied to a machine or involve a physical transformation.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court later reversed that decision in Bilski v. Kappos, finding that the \u201cmachine-or-transformation\u201d test is not the only test for determining patent eligibility. The Court, however, declined to specify how and when processes are patentable. On March 30, 2012, in the case Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit\u2019s application of Bilski and invalidated a patent focused on a process for identifying a proper dosage for an existing therapeutic because the patent claim embodied a law of nature. On July 3, 2012, the USPTO released a memorandum entitled \u201c2012 Interim Procedure for Subject Matter Eligibility Analysis of Process Claims Involving Laws of Nature,\u201d with guidelines for determining patentability of diagnostic or other processes in line with the Mayo decision. On June 13, 2013, in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, the Supreme Court held that a naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated. The Supreme Court did not address the patentability of any innovative method claims involving the manipulation of isolated genes. On March 4, 2014, the USPTO released a memorandum entitled \u201c2014 Procedure for Subject Matter Eligibility Analysis Of Claims Reciting Or Involving Laws Of Nature/Natural Principles, Natural Phenomena, And/Or Natural Products.\u201d This memorandum provides guidelines for the USPTO\u2019s new examination procedure for subject matter eligibility under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 for claims embracing natural products or natural principles.\nOn June 12, 2015, the Federal Circuit issued a decision in Ariosa v. Sequenom holding that a method for detecting a paternally inherited nucleic acid of fetal origin performed on a maternal serum or plasma sample from a pregnant female were unpatentable as directed to a naturally occurring phenomenon. On July 30, 2015, the USPTO released a Federal Register Notice entitled, \u201cJuly 2015 Update on Subject Matter Eligibility,\u201d This Notice updated the USPTO guidelines for the USPTO\u2019s procedure for subject matter eligibility under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 for claims embracing natural products or natural principles phenomenon. On May 4, 2016, the USPTO released life science examples that were intended to be used in conjunction with the USPTO guidance on subject matter eligibility. Although the guidelines and examples do not have the force of law, patent examiners have been instructed to follow them. On February 6, 2019, the Federal Circuit for Court of Appeals issued a decision in Athena Diagnostics, Inc. v. Mayo Collaborative Servs., LLC, which relied on the decisions from Mayo and Ariosa, to find a claim directed to a method for diagnosing neurotransmission or developmental disorders related to muscle specific tyrosine kinase not eligible for patenting under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. What constitutes a law of nature and a sufficient inventive concept continues to remain uncertain, and it is possible that certain aspects of diagnostic tests will continue to be considered natural laws and, therefore, ineligible for patent protection.\nSome aspects of our technology involve processes that may be subject to this evolving standard and we cannot guarantee that any of our pending or issued claims will be patentable or upheld as valid as a result of such evolving standards. In addition, patents we own or license that issued before these recent cases may be subject to challenge in court or before the USPTO in view of these current legal standards. Accordingly, the evolving interpretation and application of patent laws in the United States governing the eligibility of diagnostics for patent protection may adversely affect our ability to obtain patents and may facilitate third-party challenges to any owned and licensed patents. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations and application of patent laws may also diminish the value of our existing intellectual property or intellectual property that we continue to develop. We cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforceable in our patents or in third-party patents.\nWe may be involved in litigation related to intellectual property, which could be time-intensive and costly and may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe may receive notices of claims of direct or indirect infringement or misappropriation or misuse of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights from time to time and some of these claims may lead to litigation. We cannot assume that we will prevail in such actions, or that other actions alleging misappropriation or misuse by us of third-party trade secrets, infringement by us of third-party patents and trademarks or other rights, or the validity of our patents, trademarks or other rights, will not be asserted or prosecuted against us. We might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions. No assurance can be given that other patent applications will not have priority over our patent applications. If third parties bring these proceedings against our patents, we could incur significant costs and experience management distraction. Litigation may be necessary for us to enforce our patents and proprietary rights or to determine the scope, coverage and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Defending any litigation, and particularly patent litigation, is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome of any litigation or other proceeding is inherently uncertain and might not be favorable to us. It is also possible that we might not be able to obtain licenses to technology that we require on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity, scope and coverage of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive, even if we were to prevail. Any litigation that may be necessary in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay damages and ongoing royalties, and obtain one or more licenses from third parties, or be prohibited from selling our products. We may not be able to obtain these licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. We could incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties, which could negatively affect our financial results. In addition, our agreements with some of our customers, suppliers or other entities with whom we do business require us to defend or indemnify these parties to the extent they become involved in infringement claims, including the types of claims described above. If we are required or agree to defend or indemnify third parties in connection with any infringement claims, we could incur significant costs and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOther Risks Related to our Business\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited and may result in increased future tax liability to us.\nWe have incurred net losses since 2015 and may never achieve or sustain profitability. As of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, we had U.S. federal and state net operating losses, or NOLs, of approximately $118.6 million and $56.3 million respectively. Subject to the final two sentences of this paragraph, the federal and state NOL carryforwards will begin to expire, if not utilized, beginning in 2028 for certain states. These NOL carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under current federal income tax law, federal NOLs incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal NOLs is limited to 80% of Federal taxable income.\nTo the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any. We may be limited in the portion of NOL and tax credit carryforwards that we can use in the future to offset taxable income for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Sections 382 and 383 of Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the Code, limit the use of NOLs and tax credits after a cumulative change in corporate ownership of more than 50% occurs within a three-year period. The limitation could prevent us from using some or all of our NOLs and tax credits, as it places a formula limit of how much of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards we would be permitted to use in a tax year. The amount of the annual limitation, if any, will be determined based on the value of our company immediately prior to an ownership change. During the periods 2017 through 2019, the company experienced greater than 50% changes in ownership and as a result, NOLs attributable to the pre-ownership change are subject to a substantial annual limitation under Section 382 of the Code due to the ownership changes. The Company has adjusted their NOL carryforwards to address the impact of the Section 382 ownership changes. Federal Net Operating Losses of $71.2 million are subject to annual limitation as of the ownership changes for ownership changes. The remaining $47.4 million of NOLs incurred post July 15, 2019 are not subject to any annual limitation and can be carried forward indefinitely. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. In the event we have undergone or will undergo an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may become subject to these limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.\nComprehensive tax reform could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nNew income, sales and use or other tax laws or regulations could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws and regulations could be interpreted, modified or applied adversely to us. These events could require us to pay additional taxes on a prospective or retroactive basis, as well as penalties, interest and other costs for past amounts deemed to be due. New laws, or laws that are changed, modified or newly interpreted or applied, also could increase our compliance, operating and other costs, as well as the costs of our products. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws, some of which were further modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, and may be modified in the future by the current or a future presidential administration. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to current federal law, or any newly enacted federal tax legislation. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net operating losses, and other deferred tax assets relating to our operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets and could increase our future tax expense.\nIf we do not increase our revenues and successfully manage the size of our operations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe majority of our operating expenses are personnel-related costs such as employee compensation and benefits, reagents and disposable supplies as well as the cost of infrastructure to support our operations, including facility space and equipment. We continuously review our personnel to determine whether we are fully utilizing their services. If we believe we are not in a position to fully utilize our personnel, we may make reductions to our workforce. If we are unable to achieve revenue growth in the future or fail to adjust our cost infrastructure to the appropriate level to support our revenues, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may acquire businesses or assets or make investments in other companies or testing, service or solution technologies that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of synergistic businesses or other related assets. If we make any further acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. Any future acquisition by us also could result in significant write-offs or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could harm our operating results and financial condition. Integration of an acquired company or business will also likely require management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our existing business. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. To finance any acquisitions or investments, we may choose to issue shares of our common stock as consideration, which would dilute the ownership of our stockholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies for stock. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for these activities through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. If these funds are raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, dilution to our stockholders could result. The holders of our Series B Preferred Stock have the right to approve any public offering. Consummating an acquisition poses a number of risks including:\n\u25cf we may not be able to accurately estimate the financial impact of an acquisition on our overall business;\n\u25cf an acquisition may require us to incur debt or other obligations, incur large and immediate write-offs, issue capital stock potentially dilutive to our stockholders or spend significant cash, or may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition;\n\u25cf if we spend significant funds or incur additional debt or other obligations, our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline;\n\u25cf worse than expected performance of an acquired business may result in the impairment of intangible assets;\n\u25cf we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from acquisitions as a result of inherent risks and uncertainties, including difficulties integrating acquired businesses or retaining key personnel, partners, customers or other key relationships, and risks that acquired entities may not operate profitably or that acquisitions may not result in improved operating performance;\n\u25cf we may fail to successfully manage relationships with customers, distributors and suppliers;\n\u25cf our customers may not accept new molecular diagnostic tests or pharma services from our acquired businesses;\n\u25cf we may fail to effectively coordinate sales and marketing efforts of our acquired businesses;\n\u25cf we may fail to combine product offerings and product lines of our acquired businesses timely and efficiently;\n\u25cf an acquisition may involve unexpected costs or liabilities, including as a result of pending and future shareholder lawsuits relating to acquisitions or exercise by stockholders of their statutory appraisal rights, or the effects of purchase accounting may be different from our expectations;\n\u25cf an acquisition may involve significant contingent payments that may adversely affect our future liquidity or capital resources;\n\u25cf accounting for contingent payments requires significant judgment and changes to the assumptions used in determining the fair value of our contingent payments could lead to significant volatility in earnings;\n\u25cf acquisitions and subsequent integration of these companies may disrupt our business and distract our management from other responsibilities; and\n\u25cf the costs of an unsuccessful acquisition may adversely affect our financial performance.\nAdditional risks of integration of an acquired business include:\n\u25cf differing information technology, internal control, financial reporting and record-keeping systems;\n\u25cf differences in accounting policies and procedures;\n\u25cf unanticipated additional transaction and integration-related costs;\n\u25cf facilities or operations of acquired businesses in remote locations and the inherent risks of operating in unfamiliar legal and regulatory environments; and\n\u25cf new products, including the risk that any underlying intellectual property associated with such products may not have been adequately protected or that such products may infringe on the proprietary rights of others.\nIf our information technology or communications systems fail or we experience a significant interruption in their operation, our reputation, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology and communications systems. Increasingly, we are also dependent upon our ability to electronically interface with our customers. The failure of these systems to operate as anticipated could disrupt our business and result in decreased revenue and increased overhead costs. In addition, we do not have complete redundancy for all of our systems and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Our information technology and communications systems, including the information technology systems and services that are maintained by third party vendors, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, fire, terrorist attacks, epidemics, pandemics including COVID-19, malicious attacks by computer viruses or hackers, power loss, failure of computer systems, Internet, telecommunications or data networks. In 2017, we discovered malware installed on certain clinical services servers. We do not believe that any data on the affected servers was accessed or compromised. We removed the malware, and enhanced our cybersecurity procedures. Additionally, our clinical services and pharma services are largely dependent on our partially internally developed and partially purchased Laboratory Information Management Systems or LIMS, which is our automated basis of managing operations and storing data and customer information. If these systems or services become unavailable or suffer a security breach, or are uneconomical or impossible to update and modify, we may expend significant resources to address these problems, and our reputation, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related To Our Common Stock Price\nThe price and trading volume of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be further affected by events not within our control, and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.\nDuring 2021, our common stock traded at a low of $2.98 and a high of $10.51. During 2020, our common stock traded at a low of $2.57 and a high of $11.00. Volatility in our stock price or trading volume may be in response to various factors, some of which may be beyond our control. In addition to the other factors discussed or incorporated by reference herein, factors that may cause fluctuations in our stock price or trading volume, include, among others:\n\u25cf general volatility in the trading markets;\n\u25cf the impact of the delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq and listing on the OTCQX;\n\u25cf adverse research and development results;\n\u25cf significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf significant changes in our cash and cash equivalent reserves;\n\u25cf our liquidity and ability to obtain additional capital, including the market\u2019s reaction to any announced capital-raising transactions;\n\u25cf market assessments of any announced strategic transaction, including the likelihood that it would be completed and the timing for completion;\n\u25cf potential negative market reaction to the terms or volume of any issuance of shares of our common stock, preferred stock or other securities to new investors, pursuant to strategic or capital-raising transactions or to employees, directors or other service providers;\n\u25cf sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that substantial amounts of our common stock may be sold, by stockholders in the public market;\n\u25cf announcements regarding our business or the business of our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements regarding our equity offerings;\n\u25cf strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u25cf industry and/or regulatory developments;\n\u25cf changes in revenue mix;\n\u25cf changes in revenue and revenue growth rates for us and for the industries in which we operate;\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u25cf statements or changes in opinions, ratings or earnings estimates made, or the failure to make, by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the markets in which we operate or expect to operate; and\n\u25cf general market and economic conditions.\nThe issuance of additional shares of our common stock in any future offerings could be dilutive to stockholders.\nThe issuance of additional shares of our common stock in any future offerings could be dilutive to stockholders. In order to raise additional capital, such securities may be at prices that are not the same as the price per share in previous offerings. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share paid by investors in previous offerings, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. Moreover, to the extent that we issue options or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, shares of our common stock in the future (including our Series B Preferred Stock), and those options, warrants or other securities are exercised, converted or exchanged, stockholders may experience further dilution.\nThe delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq and subsequent trading on OTCQX\u00ae has adversely affected our common stock and business and financial condition.\nOn February 25, 2020, our common stock was delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) and commenced trading on the OTCQX\u00ae Best Market tier of the OTC Markets Group Inc. (the \u201cOTCQX\u201d), an electronic quotation service operated by OTC Markets Group Inc.\nTrading in stock quoted on the OTCQX is often thin, volatile, and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with the issuer\u2019s operations, results or business prospects. The availability of buyers and sellers represented by this volatility could lead to a market price for our Common Stock that is unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTCQX is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities quoted on the OTCQX is often more volatile than the trading of securities listed on a stock exchange like Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. The OTCQX quotation system may provide less liquidity than Nasdaq.\nPrices for securities traded solely on the OTCQX quotation system may be difficult to obtain, and holders of our common stock may be unable to resell their shares at or near their original acquisition price or at any price. Further, our delisting from Nasdaq and commencement of trading on the OTCQX has and may continue to have negative implications, including an adverse effect on the price of our common stock, increased volatility in our common stock, the loss of federal preemption of state securities laws, greater difficulty in raising capital through the public or private sale of equity securities, deterring broker-dealers from making a market in or otherwise seeking or generating interest in our common stock, a loss of current or future coverage by certain sell-side analysts, deterring certain institutions and persons from investing in our securities at all and a loss of confidence of our customers, collaborators, vendors, suppliers and employees, which could harm our business and future prospects.\nThe risks associated with penny stock classification could affect the marketability of the Company\u2019s common stock and stockholders could find it difficult to sell their shares.\nIf the Company\u2019s shares of Common Stock do not maintain a trading price of $5.00 or more per share, the Company\u2019s common stock will be subject to \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules as defined in Exchange Act Rule 3a51-1. The SEC adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Transaction costs associated with purchases and sales of penny stocks are likely to be higher than those for other securities. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00.\nThe penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation.\nIn addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from such rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the Company\u2019s common stock and stockholders may find it more difficult to sell their shares.\nRisks Relating to Being a Public Company\nWe will continue to incur increased costs and demands on management as a result of compliance with laws and regulations applicable to public companies, which could harm our operating results.\nAs a public company, we are incurring significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition to being required to comply with certain requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), we are required to comply with certain requirements of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. We expect that compliance with these requirements will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, we expect that our management and other personnel will continue to need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements.\nFor example, in 2020, our Audit Committee conducted an independent investigation in accordance with Section 10A of the Exchange Act into complaints of certain employment and billing and compliance matters and concluded that the allegations made in the complaints were unsubstantiated and that there was no evidence of any illegal acts. The completion of the investigation caused us to be late in filing our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020.\nWe also recently spent considerable management time in connection with our restatement of previously issued financial statements contained in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2014 through 2019 as well as the financial statements contained in the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each quarterly period within those fiscal years as well as the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020. This was due to evaluating and recording an impairment charge and amortization expense relating to our BarreGen asset, as disclosed in Item 9A of our Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2021.\nFurther, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, if we lose our status as a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we will be required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as applicable, requires us to incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We currently do not have an internal audit group, and we will need to continue to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nIf we are unable to maintain and implement effective internal controls over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our reported financial information and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on our internal controls on an annual basis. If we have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We will need to maintain and enhance these processes and controls as we grow, and we will require additional management and staff resources to do so. Additionally, even if we conclude our internal controls are effective for a given period, we may in the future identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls, in which case our management will be unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that there are material weaknesses with respect to our internal controls or the level at which our internal controls are documented, designed, implemented or reviewed.\nIf we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial disclosures, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. Irrespective of compliance with Section 404, any failure of our internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our reported operating results and harm our reputation. Internal control deficiencies could also result in a restatement of our financial results.\nRisks Relating to Our Corporate Structure and Our Common Stock\nWe have a substantial number of authorized shares of common and preferred stock available for future issuance that could cause dilution of our stockholders\u2019 interest, adversely impact the rights of holders of our common stock and cause our stock price to decline.\nWe have a total of 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized for issuance. As of December 31, 2021, we had 95,771,831 shares of common stock and 4,953,000 shares of preferred stock available for issuance. As of December 31, 2021, we have reserved 961,450 shares of our common stock for issuance under our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan and 25,715 shares of our common stock for issuance under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 602,077 additional shares available for future grants of awards under our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan as well as warrants for 1,404,648 shares of our common stock outstanding at prices ranging from $9.40 to $46.90 per warrant share. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued through conversion of all of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock is 7,833,334. Provided that we have a sufficient number of unreserved authorized capital stock available, we may seek financing that could result in the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock and/or rights to acquire additional shares of our capital stock. We may also make acquisitions that result in issuances of additional shares of our capital stock. Those additional issuances of capital stock could result in substantial dilution of our existing stockholders. Furthermore, the book value per share of our common stock may be reduced. This reduction would occur if the exercise price of any issued warrants, the conversion price of any convertible notes or the conversion ratio of any issued preferred stock is lower than the book value per share of our common stock at the time of such exercise or conversion. Additionally, new investors in any subsequent issuances of our securities could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of common stock.\nThe addition of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the market or the registration of any of our other securities under the Securities Act may significantly and negatively affect the prevailing market price for our common stock. The future sales of shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and options may have a depressive effect on the market price of our common stock, as such warrants and options would be more likely to be exercised at a time when the price of our common stock is greater than the exercise price.\nWe have anti-takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition and could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws include provisions, such as providing for three classes of directors, which may make it more difficult to remove our directors and management and may adversely affect the price of our common stock. In addition, our certificate of incorporation, as amended, authorizes the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which allows our Board to create one or more classes of preferred stock with rights and preferences greater than those afforded to the holders of our common stock without separate shareholder approval. This provision could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a future takeover or a change in control, unless the takeover or change in control is approved by our Board. We are also subject to laws that may have a similar effect. For example, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. As a result of the foregoing, it will be difficult for another company to acquire us and, therefore, could limit the price that possible investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. In addition, the rights of our common stockholders are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of our Series B Preferred Stock as well as any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future and by the rights of holders of warrants currently outstanding or issued in the future.\nWe have not declared any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Future earnings, if any, will be used to finance the future operation and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and we may not have sufficient funds legally available to pay dividends. We are prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock without the approval of the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock for so long as 30% of the Series B Preferred Stock outstanding as of January 15, 2020 remains outstanding. We presently intend to retain all earnings for our operations. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be an investor\u2019s sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nIf securities or industry analysts issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock or do not publish research or reports about our company, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us, our business and our competitors. We do not control these analysts or the content and opinions or financial models included in their reports. Securities analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our company, and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The price of our common stock could also decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our common stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business. If one or more equity research analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert our management\u2019s attention.\nThe market price of our securities may be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nThe indemnification rights provided to our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against its directors, officers, and employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended, contains provisions permitting us to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, and employees. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in us incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against our directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 86083, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "IDXG"}
