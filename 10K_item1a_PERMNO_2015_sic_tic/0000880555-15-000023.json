Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and cash flows and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nOur substantial indebtedness and our ability to incur additional indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future performance could be affected by our substantial indebtedness. As of March 31, 2015, our total outstanding indebtedness was approximately $324.3 million, consisting of $275.2 million principal amount of debt under the First Lien Notes, $2.2 million principal amount of debt under the Second Lien Notes, $32.2 million principal amount of debt under the New Second Lien Notes (the First Lien Notes, the Second Lien Notes and the New Second Lien Notes are collectively referred to herein as the \"Senior Secured Notes\") and $14.7 million amount of debt under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility. Our total consolidated interest expense was $50.8 million for fiscal 2015, which consists of interest under the Senior Secured Notes and the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes contain certain covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, restrict us from paying dividends, incurring additional debt, creating liens, entering into certain mergers or consolidations, making acquisitions or other investments and selling or otherwise disposing of assets.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences for our business and operations, including the following:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate requirements or to carry out other aspects of our business;\n\u2022\nplace us at a potential disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to make material acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities that may arise;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business industry;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements or to carry out other aspects of our business; and\n\u2022\nexpose us to fluctuations in interest rates as the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility has a variable rate of interest.\nUnder the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility, we have to comply with a maximum first lien leverage ratio, a consolidated leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. Our ability to satisfy these ratios is dependent on our business performing in accordance with our projections. If the performance of our business deviates from our projections, we may not be able to satisfy these ratios. If we do not comply with these or other covenants and restrictions, we would be in default under our Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility unless we obtained a waiver from the required lenders thereunder. Our outstanding debt under our Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable and commitments thereunder could be terminated. Our ability to comply with such provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Moreover, the instruments governing almost all our other debt contain cross-acceleration provisions so that acceleration under any of our debt may result in a default under our other debt instruments. If a cross-acceleration occurs, the maturity of almost all our debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable. If that happens, we would not be able to satisfy our debt obligations, which would have a substantial adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern.\nObligations under our Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility are secured by liens on substantially all our assets and the assets of certain domestic subsidiaries. In addition, our obligations under our Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a pledge of all the issued and outstanding shares of, or other equity interests in, certain of our existing or subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries and a percentage of the capital stock of, or other equity interests in, certain of our existing or subsequently acquired or organized foreign subsidiaries. If we, or one of our restricted subsidiaries, should be declared bankrupt or insolvent, or if we otherwise default under our Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility, the lenders could declare all the funds borrowed thereunder, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable and commitments thereunder could be terminated. If we were unable to repay such debt, the lenders could foreclose on the pledged stock of our subsidiaries and on the assets in which they have been granted a security interest.\nIf our operations do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt service obligations, we may need to borrow additional funds to make these payments or undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, disposing of assets or reducing or delaying capital investments and acquisitions. We cannot guarantee that such additional funds or alternative financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain additional funds or alternative financing on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that we can obtain alternative financing proceeds in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nChanges in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity, increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options.\nOur corporate credit rating is currently rated below investment grade by Standard & Poor\u2019s. If our credit ratings are lowered further, borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities may increase and our financing options would be limited. A reduction in our credit rating or the credit rating of our outstanding debt securities may also cause our future borrowings to be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility. In addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as continued or increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new acquisitions or capital-intensive internal initiatives.\nIf we fail to implement our business strategy, our business will be adversely affected.\nOur future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. We may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy or improve our operating results. In particular, we may not be able to increase circulation of our publications, obtain new sources of advertising revenues, generate additional revenues by building on the brand names of our publications or raise the cover prices of our publications without causing a decline in circulation.\nAny failure to successfully implement our business strategy may adversely affect our ability to service our indebtedness, including our ability to make principal and interest payments on the debt. We may, in addition, decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time.\nWe face significant competition from other magazine publishers and other forms of media, including digital media, which we expect will continue, and as a result we may not be able to maintain or improve our operating results and competitive position.\nWe compete in varying degrees with other magazine publishers for market share and for the time and attention of consumers of print magazine content. We believe the overall decline in consumer demand for print magazines has been negatively impacted by the multitude of choices available to consumers for information and entertainment which has intensified our competition with other magazine publishers for share of print magazine readership. Competition among print magazine publishers for magazine readership is based primarily on brand perception, magazine cover selection and content, quality and price as well as placement and display in retail outlets.\nWe also compete with digital publishers and other forms of media, including websites, digital magazines, tablet editions and mobile apps. The competition we face has intensified as a result of the growing popularity of mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. Consumers are increasingly opting to consume publisher's content through these digital platforms and are shifting away from print media. These new platforms have reduced the cost of producing and distributing content on a wide scale, allowing new free or low-priced digital content providers to compete with us and other print magazine publishers. The ability of our paid print and digital content to compete successfully with free and low-priced digital content depends on several factors, including our ability to differentiate and distinguish our content from free or low-priced digital content, as well as our ability to increase the value of paid subscriptions to our customers by offering a different, deeper and richer digital experience. If we are unable to distinguish our content from that of our competitors or adapt to new distribution methods, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nCompetition among print magazine and digital publishers for advertising is primarily based on the circulation and readership of magazines and the number of visitors to websites, respectively, the demographic profile of the audience, advertising rates and the effectiveness of advertising sales teams. The continuing shift in consumer preference from print media to digital media has introduced significant new competition for advertising. We believe our advertising sales team has the optimal structure to provide integrated marketing solutions for combined print and digital advertising and we can compete successfully for advertising. If we are unable to convince advertisers of the continuing value of our combined print and digital advertising platforms or offer advertisers unique advertising programs tied to our brands, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to risk associated with weak domestic and global economic conditions.\nWe have been adversely affected by weak domestic and global economic conditions and have experienced declines in our circulation and to a lesser extent our advertising revenues. If these conditions persist, our business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be adversely affected. Factors that affect economic conditions include the rate of unemployment, the level of consumer confidence and changes in consumer spending habits. Because magazines are generally discretionary purchases for consumers, our circulation revenues are sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles. Certain economic conditions such as general economic downturns, including periods of increased inflation, unemployment levels, tax rates, interest rates, gasoline and other energy prices or declining consumer confidence, negatively impact consumer spending. Reduced consumer spending or a shift in consumer spending patterns away from discretionary items will likely result in reduced demand for our magazines.\nHistorically, we have been able to offset some of the declines in circulation revenues, in part, through increases in cover prices and cost reductions. We may not be able to increase cover prices without decreasing circulation or be able to take other measures, such as increasing advertising rates or pages and reducing print orders of our titles, to offset such circulation revenue declines. In addition, we may not be able to reverse the circulation revenue declines described above, and such declines in circulation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also face risks associated with the impact of weak domestic and global economic conditions on third parties with which we do business, such as advertisers, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers and other parties. For example, if retailers file for reorganization under bankruptcy laws or otherwise experience negative effects on their businesses due to volatile or weak economic conditions, it could reduce the number of outlets for our magazines, which in turn could reduce the attractiveness of our magazines to advertisers. In addition, any financial instability of the wholesalers that distribute our print magazines to retailers could have various negative effects on us. See \u201c-We have experienced, and may in the future continue to face increased costs and business disruption from instability in our wholesaler distribution channels.\u201d\nWe derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising, and a decrease in overall advertising expenditures could lead to a reduction in the amount of advertising that companies are willing to purchase from us and the price at which they purchase it. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting domestic and global economic conditions. If the economic prospects of advertisers or current economic conditions worsen, such conditions could alter current or prospective advertisers\u2019 spending priorities. Declines in consumer spending on advertisers\u2019 products due to weak economic conditions could also indirectly negatively impact our advertising revenues, as advertisers may not perceive as much value from advertising if consumers are purchasing fewer of their products or services.\nWe have experienced, and may in the future continue to face increased costs and business disruption from instability in our wholesaler distribution channels.\nWe operate a distribution network that relies on wholesalers to distribute our magazines to newsstands and other retail outlets. A small number of wholesalers are responsible for a substantial percentage of wholesale magazine distribution in the United States. We are experiencing significant declines in magazine sales at newsstands and other retail outlets. In light of these declines and the challenging general economic climate, there may be further consolidation among the wholesalers and one or more may become insolvent or unable to pay amounts due in a timely manner. Distribution channel disruptions can impede our ability to distribute magazines to the retail marketplace, which could, among other things, negatively affect the ability of certain magazines to meet the rate base established with advertisers. Disruption in the wholesaler channel, an increase in wholesaler costs or the failure of wholesalers to pay amounts due could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See also \u201cOur circulation revenue consists of single copy sales distributed to retailers primarily by two wholesalers and the loss of either of these wholesalers could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\u201d\nOur circulation revenue consists of single copy sales distributed to retailers primarily by two wholesalers and the loss of either of these wholesalers could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nDuring fiscal 2015 single copy sales accounted for 78% of total circulation revenue and 79% during fiscal 2014 and 2013 and consisted of copies distributed to retailers primarily by two wholesalers. During fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, The News Group accounted for approximately 36%, 29% and 29%, respectively, of our total operating revenue and Hudson Group accounted for approximately 9%, 8% and 9%, respectively. We have long-term service arrangements with our wholesalers, which provide incentives to maintain certain levels of service. When these arrangements expire, we may not be able to renew them on favorable terms, extend the terms of these arrangements or extend our relationship with the wholesalers at all. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by disruption of the distribution of our magazines through these wholesalers.\nIn May 2014, Source, our second-largest wholesaler at such time, notified us that they were ceasing substantially all distribution operations in the near term and filed for bankruptcy in June 2014.\nChanges to U.S. or international regulation of our business or the businesses of our advertisers could cause us to incur additional costs or liabilities, negatively impact our revenues or disrupt our business practices.\nOur digital businesses are subject to government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and our Web sites, which are available worldwide, may be subject to laws regulating the Internet even in jurisdictions where we do not do business. Advertising and promotional information presented to visitors on our websites and our other marketing activities are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws that regulate unfair and deceptive practices. In the United States, Congress has adopted legislation that regulates certain aspects of the Internet, including on-line content, user privacy, taxation, liability for third-party activities and jurisdiction. Federal, state, local and foreign governments are also considering other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate the Internet in more and different ways than exist today. We may incur increased costs necessary to comply with existing and newly adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply. Revenues from our digital businesses could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by these existing or future laws and regulations.\nOur business performance is also indirectly affected by the laws and regulations that govern the businesses of our advertisers. For example, the pharmaceutical industry, which accounts for a significant portion of our advertising revenues in our Men's Active Lifestyle segment, is subject to regulations of the Food and Drug Administration in the United States requiring pharmaceutical advertisers to communicate certain disclosures to consumers about advertised pharmaceutical products, typically through the purchase of print media advertising. We face the risk that the Food and Drug Administration could change pharmaceutical marketing regulations in a way that is detrimental to the sale of print advertising.\nIn addition, changes in laws and regulations that currently allow us to retain customer data and to engage in certain forms of consumer marketing, such as automatic renewal of subscriptions for our magazines and negative option offers via direct mail, email, on-line or telephone solicitation, could have a negative impact on our circulation revenues and adversely affect our financial condition and operating performance.\nOur business and results of operations could be negatively affected by postal service changes, and our results of operations may be adversely affected by increases in postal rates.\nThe financial condition of the U.S. Postal Service (the \u201cUSPS\u201d) continues to decline. In the past the USPS closed numerous mail processing centers and has announced plans to close additional processing centers in 2014, which could result in slower delivery of first class mail and periodicals. The USPS is currently prohibited under a Congressional resolution from discontinuing Saturday mail delivery, but the USPS and some members of Congress are attempting to lift that ban as part of comprehensive postal reform. Our subscribers expect our weekly magazines to be delivered in the same week that they are printed, and the elimination of Saturday mail delivery or slower delivery of periodicals, absent changes to our internal production schedules, could result in a certain percentage of our weekly magazines not reaching subscribers until the following week. We cannot predict how the USPS will address its fiscal condition in the future, and changes to delivery, reduction in staff or additional closings of processing centers may lead to changes in our internal production schedules or other changes in order to continue to meet our subscribers\u2019 expectations.\nOther measures taken to address the declining financial condition of the USPS could include increases in the rates for periodicals and local post office closures. We cannot predict with certainty the magnitude of future price changes in postage. In particular, postage represents a significant component of our total cost to distribute our printed products and represented approximately 6% of our total operating expense for fiscal 2015. If there are significant increases in postal rates and we are not able to offset such increases, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur business and results of operations may be adversely affected by increases in fuel costs and the price of paper.\nMany aspects of our business have been directly affected by increases in the cost of fuel and paper. Increased fuel costs have translated into increased costs for the products and services we receive from our third-party suppliers, including, but not limited to, increased production and distribution costs for our products. Paper represents a significant component of our total cost to produce our printed products and represented approximately 11% of our total operating expenses for fiscal 2015. Paper is a commodity and the price has been subject to significant volatility due to supply and demand in the marketplace as well as volatility in the raw material and other costs incurred by our paper suppliers. Although we have a long-term paper supply and purchasing agreement with the largest paper supply broker, we do not have any long-term pricing agreements with paper suppliers and suppliers may raise their prices for paper from time to time.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the magnitude of future price changes in paper or how increases in fuel costs will affect our third-party suppliers and the rates they charge us. If fuel or paper prices increase and we are not able to offset such increases, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we lose one or more of our vendors.\nWe rely on third-party vendors, including paper suppliers, printers, subscription fulfillment houses and subscription agents for the print portion of our business. The industries in which our print-related third-party vendors operate have experienced significant restructurings and consolidation in recent years, resulting in decreased availability of goods and services and competition. Further disruptions in these industries may make our third-party vendors unable or unwilling to provide us with goods and services on favorable terms and may lead to greater dependence on certain vendors, increased prices, and interruptions and delays in the services provided by these vendors, all of which would adversely affect our business.\nWe may suffer credit losses that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe extend unsecured credit to most of our customers. We recognize that extending credit and setting appropriate reserves for receivables is largely a subjective decision based on knowledge of the customer and the industry. Credit exposure also includes the amount of estimated unbilled sales. The level of credit is influenced by the customer\u2019s credit history with us and other available information, including industry-specific data.\nWe maintain a reserve account for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay, additional allowances might be required, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFuture acquisitions, partnerships, publishing services agreements and joint ventures may require significant resources.\nIn the future, we may seek to grow the Company and its businesses by making acquisitions or entering into partnerships, publishing services agreements or joint ventures. Any future acquisition, partnership, publishing services agreement or joint venture may require that we make significant cash investments, issue stock or incur substantial indebtedness. Such acquisitions and investments may require additional funding which may be provided in the form of additional indebtedness, equity financing or a combination thereof. We cannot assure that any such additional funding will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, or that we will be permitted under the terms of the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility (or any replacement thereof) or under the terms of the indentures governing our Senior Secured Notes to obtain such financing for such purpose.\nWe have incurred indebtedness in the past to finance acquisitions. We may finance future acquisitions with additional indebtedness, subject to limits in our debt agreements. As a result, we could face the financial risks associated with incurring additional indebtedness such as reducing our liquidity and access to financing markets and increasing the amount of cash flow required to service such indebtedness.\nWe may make acquisitions or enter into partnerships, publishing services agreements or joint ventures which could involve inherent risk and uncertainties.\nWe may make acquisitions or enter into partnerships, publishing services agreements or joint ventures which could involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operating in an efficient and effective manner;\n\u2022\nthe inability to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships;\n\u2022\nthe potential diversion of senior management's attention from our operations;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems;\n\u2022\nexposure to unanticipated liabilities; and\n\u2022\nchallenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits.\nIf an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated, cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business or one or more of the other risk and uncertainties identified above occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe are expanding our merchandising and licensing programs into new areas and products, the failure of any of which could diminish the perceived value of our brand, impair our ability to grow and adversely affect our prospects.\nOur growth depends to a significant degree upon our ability to develop new or expand existing retail merchandising programs. We have entered into several new merchandising and licensing agreements in the past few years. Some of these agreements include exclusivity provisions and have a duration of many years. While we require that our licensees maintain the quality of our respective brands through specific contractual provisions, we cannot be certain that our licensees, or their manufacturers and distributors, will honor their contractual obligations or that they will not take other actions that will diminish the value of our brands.\nThere is also a risk that our extension into new business areas will meet with disapproval from consumers. We cannot guarantee that these programs will be fully implemented, or, if implemented, that they will be successful. If the licensing or merchandising programs do not succeed, we may be prohibited from seeking different channels for our products due to the exclusivity provisions and multi-year terms of these agreements. Disputes with new or existing licensees may arise that could hinder our ability to grow or expand our product lines. Disputes also could prevent or delay our ability to collect the licensing revenue that we expect in connection with these products. If such developments occur or our merchandising programs are otherwise not successful, the value and recognition of our brands, as well as our business, financial condition and prospects, could be materially adversely affected.\nDivestitures may affect our costs, revenues, profitability and financial position.\nIn January 2015, we sold our Shape, Fit Pregnancy and Natural Health publications, which comprised our Women's Active Lifestyle segment. We may decide to divest other segments or lines of business in the future. Divestitures have inherent risks, including possible delays in closing transactions, the risk of lower-than-expected sales proceeds for the divested businesses, unexpected costs associated with the separation of the business to be sold from our integrated information technology systems and other operating systems and potential post-closing claims for indemnification. Expected cost savings, which are offset by revenue losses from divested businesses, may also be difficult to achieve or maximize.\nElectronically stored data is subject to the risk of unauthorized access and if our data is compromised in spite of our attempts at protecting this data, we may incur significant costs, lost opportunities and damage to our reputation.\nWe maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential, proprietary and personal information in digital form. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. We develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these remain. If our data systems are compromised or if the proprietary information of our customers or employees is misappropriated, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured resulting in loss of business or morale and we could be exposed to a risk of loss due to business interruption, or litigation.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our intangible assets may be diminished and our competitive position and business may be adversely affected.\nOur business relies on a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, tradenames, copyrights and other proprietary rights, as well as contractual arrangements, including licenses, to establish and protect our intellectual property and brand names. Our continued success and competitive position depends on our proprietary trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. See \"Business - Intellectual Property\" for a description of our intellectual property assets and the steps we take to protect them.\nOther parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our brands in the marketplace. Brand dilution or the introduction of competitive brands could cause confusion in the marketplace and adversely affect the value that consumers associate with our brands, thereby negatively impacting our sales. Any such infringement of our intellectual property rights would also likely result in a commitment of our time and resources, financial or otherwise, to protect these rights through litigation or other means. In addition, third parties may assert claims against our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to successfully resolve those claims causing us to lose our ability to use our intellectual property that is the subject of those claims. Such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results from operations. Furthermore, from time to time, we may be involved in litigation in which we are enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights, which could require us to incur substantial fees and expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results from operations.\nOur performance could be adversely affected if we lose our key personnel.\nWe believe that our success is largely dependent on the abilities and experience of our senior management team. The loss of the services of one or more of these senior executives could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our overall operations or successfully execute current or future business strategies. We do not maintain key man life insurance on the lives of our senior management. We have entered into employment agreements or arrangements with our senior management team, which may contain non-compete provisions. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could disrupt our business and have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal variations.\nOur business has experienced, and is expected to continue to experience, seasonality due to, among other things, seasonal advertising patterns and seasonal influences on consumer reading habits. Typically, our revenues from advertising are highest in the fourth quarter. The effects of such seasonality make it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the previous results of any specific quarter.\nPending and future litigation or regulatory proceedings could materially affect our operations.\nSince the focus of some of our publications often involves celebrities or controversial subjects and because of our news gathering techniques, the risk of defamation or invasion of privacy litigation or the filing of criminal charges exists. While we have not historically experienced any difficulty obtaining insurance coverage, we cannot assure that we will be able to do so in the future at rates acceptable to us, or at all. In addition to the celebrity litigation in which we may be involved, from time to time we may be involved in commercial litigation. Any pending or future litigation or regulatory proceeding, if adversely determined, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the financial markets and our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTerrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the United States or U.S. businesses. These attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities, such as those in New York City, or those of our retailers, suppliers and customers. These events could cause consumer confidence and their discretionary spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets and economy. They could result in an economic recession in the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nUnder U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are required to be tested for impairment annually or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate a potential impairment exists, and long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, are required to be tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets include significant adverse changes in the business climate and declines in the value of our business.\nDuring an evaluation of goodwill and other identified intangible assets at September 30, 2014, the Company determined that indicators were present in certain reporting units which would suggest the fair value of the reporting unit may have declined below the carrying value. This decline was primarily due to the continuing softness in the consumer magazine sector, which impacts consumer and advertising spending, including further declines in certain advertising markets, resulting in lowered future cash flow projections. The evaluation resulted in the carrying value of tradenames for certain reporting units to exceed the estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $17.4 million to reduce the carrying value of tradenames and goodwill during the second quarter of fiscal 2015.\nAs of March 31, 2015, the net book value of our goodwill and other intangible assets was approximately $378.2 million. Changes in management's judgments and projections or assumptions used could result in a significantly different estimate of fair value and could materially change the impairment charge related to goodwill and tradenames.\nSome provisions of Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may deter third parties from acquiring us.\nProvisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the laws of Delaware, the state in which we are incorporated, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation impose various procedural and other requirements, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. These anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions that our stockholders desire.\nIf we do not maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls, our operating results and reputation would be harmed.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our operating results and reputation would be harmed. As part of our ongoing monitoring, we may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that require remediation.\nWe cannot assure that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, to the extent they exist, in internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure controls would be identified in the future. Any failure to maintain effective controls or timely effect any necessary improvement of our internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls could, among other things, result in losses from fraud or error, cause us not to satisfy our reporting obligations, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information or harm our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cUS GAAP\u201d), which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure draft process and, therefore, their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the reported results of operations and financial position.", "PERMNO": 76762, "SIC": 2721, "TIC": "ENQ.1"}
