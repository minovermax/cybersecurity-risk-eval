{"cik": "19612", "company": "TCF FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThere are risks, many beyond our control, which could cause our results to differ significantly from management\u2019s expectations. Some of these significant risks and uncertainties are described below. Any factor described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could, by itself or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition, and the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to not be material also may materially and adversely affect us. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to other information disclosed in our SEC filings, including the financial statements and notes thereto. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ substantially from those discussed or implied in these forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to our Business\nIf we fail to effectively manage credit risk, our business and financial condition will suffer.\nWe must effectively manage credit risk. As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms, and that the collateral securing repayment of their loans, if any, may not be sufficient to ensure repayment. In addition, there are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks relating to proper loan underwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, including the risk that a borrower may not provide information to us about its business in a timely manner, and/or may present inaccurate or incomplete information to us, and risks relating to the value of collateral. Collateral values are adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic, environmental and other conditions, including declines in the value of real estate, changes in interest rates, changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, terrorist activity, environmental contamination and other external events. In order to manage credit risk successfully, we must, among other things, maintain disciplined and prudent underwriting standards and ensure that our lenders follow those standards. The weakening of these standards for any reason, such as an attempt to attract higher yielding loans, a lack of discipline or diligence by our employees in underwriting and monitoring loans, the inability of our employees to adequately adapt policies and procedures to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting borrowers and the quality of our loan portfolio, may result in loan defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs and may necessitate that we significantly increase our allowance for loan losses, each of which could adversely affect our net income. As a result, our inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur financial results are significantly affected by general economic and political conditions.\nOur operations and profitability are impacted by both business and economic conditions generally, as well as those in the primary banking markets in which we operate. Economic conditions have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services, as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans and leases, the value of the collateral securing loans and leases, our ability to sell loans and leases, the stability of our deposit funding sources and sales revenue at the end of contractual lease terms. A significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in debt securities markets, government shutdowns, defaults, anticipated defaults or rating agency downgrades of sovereign debt (including debt of the U.S.), changes in housing market prices, depressed oil prices, trade disputes and related tariffs or other factors could impact economic conditions or may have a destabilizing effect on the financial markets and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, adverse economic conditions may result in a decline in demand for equipment that we lease or finance, which could result in a decline in the amount of new equipment being placed in service, as well as declines in the values of collateral already in service. Adverse economic conditions may also hinder us from expanding the commercial and industrial loan portfolio by limiting our ability to attract and retain manufacturers and dealers as expected. Any such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third-parties, including as a result of cyberattacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other sensitive business and consumer information on our computer systems and networks and third-party providers. Under various federal and state laws, we are responsible for safeguarding such information, and ensuring that our collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations can increase our costs.\nAlthough we take protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information across all geographic and product lines, and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances (including changes in our size and complexity) warrant, the nature of the threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber-attacks and other adverse events. Despite the defensive measures we take to manage our internal technological and operational infrastructure, these threats may originate externally from third-parties such as foreign governments, organized crime and other hackers, including as a result of attacks on infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or may originate internally from within our organization. We may not be able to ensure that all of our clients, suppliers, counterparties and other third-parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange with us. In addition, the increasing reliance on technology systems and networks and the occurrence and potential adverse impact of attacks on such systems and networks, both generally and in the financial services industry, have enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyber-security threats. As these threats, and government and regulatory oversight of associated risks, continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to enhance or expand upon the security measures we currently maintain.\nIn particular, information pertaining to us and our customers is maintained, and transactions are executed, on the networks and systems of us, our customers and certain of our third-party partners, such as our online banking or reporting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our customers against fraud and security breaches and to maintain our clients\u2019 confidence. While to the best of our knowledge we have not experienced any material breaches of information security, such breaches may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having or gaining access to our systems or our customers\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential information, including employees. Vulnerabilities in third-party technologies (and technology, including browsers and operating systems used by our customers) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to protect data. Furthermore, our customers' devices may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our customers' confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our, our customers' or other third-parties' business operations. For example, various retailers have reported they were victims of cyber-attacks in which large amounts of their customers' data, including debit and credit card information, was obtained. In these situations, we may incur costs to address fraudulent transaction activity affecting our customers.\nAlthough we have developed and continue to invest in systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and periodically test our security, a breach of our systems, or those of third-parties, could result in losses to us or our customers; loss of business and/or customers; damage to our reputation; expenses (including the cost of notification to consumers, credit monitoring and forensics, and fees and fines imposed by card networks); disruption to our business; our inability to grow our online services or other businesses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties; or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial results are subject to interest rate risk.\nOur earnings and cash flows largely depend on our net interest income. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence the amount of interest we receive on loans, leases and other investments and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings, as well as: (i) our ability to originate loans and leases and attract or retain deposits; (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities and (iii) the average life of our interest-earning assets. A significant portion of our loans, including certain consumer, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans, bear interest at variable- and adjustable-rates. Increases in market interest rates can have a negative impact on our business, including reducing the amount of money our customers borrow or adversely impacting their ability to make increased payments caused by any increase in interest rates. In addition, as interest rates increase, in order to compete for deposits in our primary banking markets, we may have to offer more attractive interest rates to depositors, or pursue other sources of liquidity, such as wholesale funding. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans, leases and other investments, our net interest income and earnings could be adversely affected due to the increase in interest expense without a corresponding increase in interest income. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans, leases and other investments decrease more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. In addition, we have an investment security portfolio that could decline substantially in value if interest rates increase materially or if obligations of states and political subdivisions become subject to less favorable tax treatment. Although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies, any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and market areas.\nWe face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, both within and beyond our primary banking markets, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources than us. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, other financial service businesses, including investment advisory and wealth management firms, mutual fund companies, and securities brokerage and investment banking firms, as well as super-regional, national and international financial institutions that operate offices in our primary market areas and elsewhere.\nThe financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. In addition, as customers' preferences and expectations continue to evolve, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet and for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. For example, consumers can now pay bills and transfer funds directly without banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries in financial transactions, known as disintermediation, could result in the loss of fee income, the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits and lending opportunities.\nWe compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and assets under management, and in making new loans. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can. To compete with these institutions, we may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits, accept lower yields on loans to attract loans and pay higher wages for new employees, resulting in lower net interest margin and reduced profitability. In addition, the loss of deposits to competitors may require us to address our liquidity needs in ways that increase our funding costs.\nOur ability to compete successfully also depends on a number of other factors, including, among other things: our ability to develop, maintain and build long-term customer relationships based on quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets; customer satisfaction with our service; and the ability to expand our market position. Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to keep pace with technological changes could adversely affect our business.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Although we are committed to keeping pace with technological advances and investing in new technology, our competitors may, through the use of new technologies that we have not implemented, whether due to cost or otherwise, be able to offer additional or superior products to those that we will be able to provide, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry and avoid interruptions, errors and delays could result in a loss of customers seeking new technology-driven products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nIn addition, the conversion of Legacy TCF\u2019s business to the selected core operating system and any future implementation of technological changes and upgrades to maintain current systems represent significant undertakings that may result in operational and customer challenges during and after implementation. Key challenges include service interruptions, transaction processing errors and system conversion delays, which may cause us to alienate customers or fail to comply with applicable laws, and may cause us to incur additional expenses, which may be substantial.\nOur allowance for loan and lease losses, and fair value adjustments with respect to loans and leases acquired in our acquisitions, may prove to be insufficient to absorb actual losses in our loan and lease portfolio, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to net income that represents management's estimate of probable and estimable losses that have been incurred within our existing loan and lease portfolio. The level of the allowance for loan and lease losses reflects management's continuing evaluation of specific credit risks, loan and lease loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, the value of real estate, present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan and lease portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Deterioration in economic conditions and declines in real estate values, new information regarding existing loans and leases, and identification of additional problem loans and other factors, all may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses.\nThe application of the purchase method of accounting in our past (and future) acquisitions will impact our allowance for loan and lease losses. Under the purchase method of accounting, all acquired loans and leases are recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements at their estimated fair value at the time of acquisition and any related allowance for loan and lease loss was eliminated because credit quality, among other factors, is considered in the determination of fair value. To the extent that our estimates of fair value of purchased loans and leases were too high, we will incur losses associated with the acquired loans and leases.\nIf our analysis or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our current allowance may not be sufficient, and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan and lease portfolio. Material additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses would materially decrease our net income and adversely affect our general financial condition.\nIn addition, our regulators, as an integral part of their periodic examination, review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management.\nNew accounting standards will require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued a new credit impairment model, the Current Expected Credit Loss (\"CECL\") model, applicable to us in 2020. Initial measurement will take place at January 1, 2020, the date of adoption, and the measure of our allowance for loan and lease losses depends on the adoption and interpretation of accounting standards. The CECL model requires certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans and leases held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, to be valued at the net amount expected to be collected over the remaining estimated life of the asset, based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the amount due. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \"incurred loss\" model currently required under GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, we expect that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine our allowance for loan and lease losses and could require us to significantly increase our allowance, increasing our capital needs. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our provision for credit losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan and lease losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also expect to incur transition costs and ongoing costs in refining and implementing the CECL methodology.\nSee the sections captioned \"Credit Quality\" in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and \"Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" and \"Note 8. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Credit Quality\" in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, located elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion related to our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond our control, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs and the impacts of epidemics or pandemics, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere have been changes and discussions with respect to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries, including China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico and retaliatory tariffs by such countries. Tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed, and additional tariffs and retaliation tariffs have been proposed. Such tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers import or export could cause the prices of our customers\u2019 products to increase which could reduce demand for such products, or reduce our customer margins, and adversely impact their revenues, financial results and ability to service debt\u037e which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future. It remains unclear what the U.S. Administration or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs already imposed, additional tariffs that may be imposed, or international trade agreements and policies. On January 26, 2020, President Trump signed a new trade deal between the United States, Canada and Mexico to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. The full impact of this agreement on us, our customers and on the economic conditions in our primary banking markets is currently unknown. In addition, coronavirus and concerns regarding the extent to which it may spread have affected, and may increasingly affect, international trade (including supply chains and export levels), travel, employee productivity and other economic activities. A trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies, as well as coronavirus or other potential epidemics or pandemics, have the potential to negatively impact ours and/or our customers\u2019 costs, demand for our customers' products, and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur supermarket branches are subject to a number of risks, including the long-term success and viability of our supermarket partners, our ability to maintain or terminate licenses or lease agreements for our supermarket locations, and customer preferences.\nA significant financial decline or change in ownership involving one of our supermarket partners, including New Albertson's Inc. (our supermarket partner for our Jewel-Osco locations) and United Natural Foods, Inc. (\u201cUNFI\u201d, our supermarket partner for our Cub Foods locations), could result in the loss of supermarket branches or could increase costs to operate our supermarket branches, of which we had 121 at December 31, 2019. We are subject to the risk, among others, that our license or lease for a location or locations will terminate upon the sale or closure of that location or locations by the supermarket partner or that we may not be able to renew branch leases with our supermarket partners on favorable terms, or at all. UNFI stated in 2019 that it intends to divest of all company-owned Cub stores in 2020. Should UNFI choose to sell any Cub Foods store, the buyer may terminate the branch license or lease for that location after a specified notice period in certain circumstances at the buyer's election. Furthermore, UNFI or an independent franchisee could choose to close any Cub Foods store after a specified notice period at which point the branch license or lease as to that location would automatically terminate.\nDifficult economic conditions, financial or labor difficulties in the supermarket industry, or a decrease in in-store customer traffic or utilization of traditional bank branches may reduce activity in our supermarket branches. Although utilization of these branches may decrease, the nature of these leases with our supermarket partners generally do not allow us to terminate significant numbers of individual branches. Because these leases are generally all renewed together, in the event of a decrease in customer utilization there may be limited opportunities to terminate unprofitable branch leases without incurring additional costs or penalties. Any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits, including estimated cost savings and revenue synergies, of our Merger with Legacy TCF.\nThe success of our Merger with Legacy TCF, which was consummated on August 1, 2019, will depend on, among other things, the ability to continue to successfully complete the integration of the merged companies in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes cost savings. In addition, we must achieve the anticipated growth and cost savings without adversely affecting current revenues and future growth. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the Merger could have an adverse effect on our revenues, level of expenses and operating results, which may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nWe may be adversely affected by risks associated with future mergers and acquisitions, including execution risk, which could disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value.\nWe plan to grow our business both organically and through mergers and acquisitions. We periodically evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies. As a result, we may engage in discussions or negotiations that, if they were to result in a transaction, could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition, including short- and long-term liquidity. Our merger and acquisition activities could be material and could require us to use a substantial amount of common stock, preferred stock, cash, other liquid assets, and/or incur debt. For example, completion of the Merger required us to issue approximately 81.9 million common shares and a new series of preferred stock. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from our merger and acquisition activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including net income per common share.\nOur merger and acquisition activities could involve a number of additional risks, including the risks of:\n\u2022\ndelay in completing an acquisition or merger due to litigation;\n\u2022\nthe recording of assets and liabilities of the acquired or merged company at fair value may materially dilute shareholder value at the transaction date and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022\nincurring the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisition or merger targets;\n\u2022\ndifficulty or unanticipated expense associated with converting the operating systems of the acquired or merged company into ours;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of regulatory approval being delayed, impeded, conditioned or denied due to existing or new regulatory issues surrounding TCF, the target institution or the proposed combined entity as a result of, among other things, issues related to anti-money laundering/Bank Secrecy Act compliance, fair lending laws, fair housing laws, consumer protection laws, unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices regulations, or the Community Reinvestment Act;\n\u2022\npotential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired or merged company;\n\u2022\nour estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the acquired or merged company may not be accurate;\n\u2022\nour exposure to potential asset quality issues of the acquired or merged company;\n\u2022\nthe time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management and opening new offices, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management's attention to the negotiation of a transaction, and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products and services into our business;\n\u2022\npotential disruption to our business;\n\u2022\nincurring and possible impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with an acquisition or merger and possible adverse short-term effects on our results of operations;\n\u2022\nthe possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired or merged company;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in estimating the value of the acquired or merged company; and\n\u2022\npotential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the acquired or merged company.\nFailure to successfully address these and other issues related to acquisitions and mergers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy.\nWe may be exposed to difficulties in combining the operations of acquired or merged businesses into our own operations, which may prevent us from achieving the expected benefits from our merger and acquisition activities.\nWe may not be able to fully achieve the strategic objectives and operating efficiencies that we anticipate in our merger and acquisition activities. In particular, the success of a merger or acquisition, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to successfully combine and integrate our businesses in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships or result in loss of customers. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company's ability to maintain relationships with customers, depositors, clients and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. If key employees depart, our business could be harmed. These and other difficulties associated with the integration of our businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risk of noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations and corresponding enforcement proceedings.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the \"PATRIOT Act\") and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and to file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Regulators also have focused on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Sanctions that the regulators have imposed on banks that have not complied with all requirements have been especially severe. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risk.\nFrom time to time, we may develop new lines of business, offer new products and services within existing lines of business, and expand into new markets or pursue new distribution channels. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly where the markets are new or not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and new products or services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of, or anticipated level of growth or profitability for new lines of business and new products or services, may not be achieved. External factors such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the success of implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Any new line of business or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain risks related to originating and selling loans that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe sell loans to generate earnings and manage our liquidity and capital levels, as well as to create geographical and product diversity in our loan portfolio. Disruptions in the financial markets, a decrease in demand for these loans, or changes to laws or regulations that reduce the attractiveness of such loans to purchasers of the loans could require us to decrease our lending activities or retain a greater portion of the loans we originate. Selling fewer loans would result in a decrease in the gains recognized on the sale of loans, could increase our capital needs as a result of the increase of risk weighted assets, result in decreased liquidity, and result in increased credit risk as our loan portfolio increased in size, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe structure of certain loan sales may result in the retention of credit or financial risks. We may receive interest-only strips or retain loan servicing rights in connection with certain of our loan sales. The interest-only strip is recorded at fair value, which represents the present value of future cash flows expected to be received by us. The value of these interest-only strips may be affected by factors such as changes in the behavior patterns of customers (including defaults and prepayments), changes in the strength of the economy and developments in the interest rate markets; therefore, actual performance may differ from our expectations. Loan servicing rights, the right to service a loan and receive servicing income over the life of the loan, are recognized as assets or liabilities at estimated fair value. The value of loan servicing rights are affected by prepayment speeds of mortgage loans and changes; therefore, actual performance may differ from our expectations. The impact of such factors could have a material adverse effect on the value of these interest-only strips and loan servicing rights and on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWhen loans are sold or securitized, it is customary to make representations, warranties and covenants to the purchaser or investors about the loans, including the manner in which they were originated and will be serviced. These agreements generally require the repurchase of loans or indemnification in the event we breach these representations, warranties or covenants and such breaches are not cured. In addition, some agreements contain a requirement to repurchase loans as a result of early payoffs by the borrower, early payment default of the borrower or defects affecting the security interest in the collateral. We have not been obligated to make significant repurchases of sold loans in the past. A material increase in the amount of loans repurchased could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our loan sales involve long-term residential mortgage loans. Purchasers of residential mortgage loans, such as government sponsored entities, require sellers of residential mortgage loans to either repurchase loans previously sold or reimburse purchasers for losses related to loans previously sold when losses are incurred on a loan due to actual or alleged failure to strictly conform to the purchaser's purchase criteria. As a result, we may face increased pressure from purchasers of our residential mortgage loans to repurchase those loans or reimburse purchasers for losses related to those loans and we may face increasing expenses to defend against such claims. If we are required in the future to repurchase loans, reimburse purchasers for losses related to loans previously sold, or if we incur increasing expenses to defend against such claims, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business, including our ability to attract and retain customer relationships, and failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nThe reputation of TCF Bank is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. Damage to our reputation could undermine the confidence of our current and potential clients in our ability to provide financial services. Such damage could also impair the confidence of our investors, counterparties and business partners, and ultimately affect our ability to effect transactions or maintain or hire qualified management and personnel. Maintenance of our reputation depends not only on our success in controlling and mitigating the various risks described herein, but also on our success in identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in areas such as potential conflicts of interest, anti-money laundering, client personal information and privacy issues, recordkeeping, regulatory investigations and any litigation that may arise from the failure or perceived failure of us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. If our reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of our employees or otherwise, the resulting negative public opinion and potential regulatory action could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to liquidity risk in our operations, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our various obligations and jeopardize our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity risk is the possibility that we will not be able to meet our obligations as they come due or capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit obligations to borrowers, loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of debt, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and earnings retention, principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, net cash provided from operations and access to other funding. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain core deposits, to obtain third-party financing on favorable terms, or to have access to interbank or other liquidity sources, we may not be able to grow our assets as quickly as we have historically. If customers move money out of bank deposits into other investments, we would need to seek other funding alternatives, including wholesale funding, in order to continue to grow, thereby increasing our funding costs, if such funding was available at all, and reducing our net interest income and net income.\nOur liquidity could also be limited by an inability to access the capital markets or by unforeseen outflows of cash, which could arise due to circumstances outside of our control, such as a general market disruption, a downturn in the markets in which we function, difficult credit markets, regulatory actions against us, or operational problems that affect us or third-parties. Our credit rating is important to our liquidity. A reduction or anticipated reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect the ability of TCF Bank and its subsidiaries to lend by adversely affecting liquidity and our competitive position, increasing our borrowing costs, limiting our access to the capital markets or triggering unfavorable contractual obligations, such as termination of or the requirement that we provide additional collateral pursuant to our derivative contracts. If we are unable to maintain adequate liquidity, then our business, financial condition and results of operations would be negatively affected.\nOur earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies, as well as other legal changes affecting businesses and consumers.\nThe policies of the Federal Reserve impact us significantly. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. Its policies directly and indirectly influence the rate of interest earned on loans and leases and paid on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits, and also affect the value of financial instruments that we hold. Changes in those policies are difficult to predict. Federal Reserve policies can also affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or leases. For example, a tightening of the money supply by the Federal Reserve could increase unemployment or reduce the demand for a borrower's products and services. This could adversely affect the borrower's earnings and ability to repay its loan or lease. As a result, changes to the fiscal and monetary policies by the Federal Reserve could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, legal changes affecting consumers and businesses, including the deductibility or other tax attributes associated with certain products, may significantly decrease the demand for certain products that we offer. For example, the Tax Cuts and Job Act (\"Tax Reform\") limits the tax deductibility of interest paid on home equity loans to those loans used to purchase or substantially improve qualified residences, which may decrease consumer demand for such loan products.\nOur evaluation of investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment involves subjective determinations and could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur evaluation of impairment in our investment securities portfolio involves a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of such investments should be recognized in current period earnings. The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer's net income, projected net income and financial condition or future recovery prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period. Estimating future cash flows involves incorporating information received from third-party sources and making internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral and/or value of the underlying asset and assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has occurred. The determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairments is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\nManagement considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. Inherent in management's evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Considerations in the impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to: (i) the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost or amortized cost; (ii) the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties; (iii) the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub-sector; (iv) the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations; (v) the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer, series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources; (vi) our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value; (vii) unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; and (viii) other subjective factors, including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies. Impairments to the carrying value of our investment securities may need to be taken in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or core deposit intangible assets, or to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the amounts paid to acquire assets over their fair value at the date of acquisition. We test goodwill at least annually for impairment. Substantially all of our goodwill at December 31, 2019 was recorded on the books of TCF Bank. The fair value of TCF Bank is impacted by the performance of its business and other factors. Core deposit intangible (\"CDI\") assets represent the estimated value of stable customer deposits, excluding time deposits, acquired in business combinations that provide a source of funds below market interest rates. We amortize our CDI assets over the estimated period the corresponding customer deposits are expected to exist. We test our CDI assets periodically for impairment. If we experience higher than expected deposit run-off, our CDI assets could be impaired. If we determine that our goodwill or CDI assets have been impaired, we must recognize a write-down by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income. Such write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2019, we had $1.3 billion of goodwill, representing 22.7% of shareholders' equity and $130.2 million of CDI assets.\nDeferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. Factors in management's determination include our performance, including the ability to generate taxable net income. If, based on available information, it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income. As of December 31, 2019, we carried a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of $12.8 million. Charges to establish a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax assets could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are periodically named as a defendant in a variety of litigation and other actions, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are periodically subject to claims and legal actions related to our operations. These claims and legal actions, could result in large, unpredictable monetary awards or penalties, as well as significant defense costs. While we maintain insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations, such insurance does not cover all types of liability, including regulatory fines or penalties and may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost, or at all. As a result, we may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, customers may make claims and take legal action pertaining to our deposit products and sale and servicing of our loan and lease products, account opening/origination practices, fees, employment practices, checking account overdraft program \u201copt in\u201d requirements, or fiduciary responsibilities. Whether or not such claims and legal actions have merit, they may result in significant financial liability and could adversely affect the market perception of TCF Bank and our products and services, as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the financial services industry has increasingly been targeted by lawsuits alleging infringement of patent rights, often from patent holding companies seeking to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. Regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, we may have to engage in protracted and costly litigation which may be time consuming and disruptive to our operations and management. If we are found to infringe on one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, we may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party, or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from utilizing certain technologies.\nFrom time to time we are, or may become, involved in suits, legal proceedings, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences.\nMany aspects of the banking business involve a substantial risk of legal liability. From time to time, we are, or may become, the subject of reviews, investigations and proceedings, and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank regulatory agencies, self-regulatory agencies, the SEC and law enforcement authorities. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgements, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way we conduct our business or reputational harm.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and government regulation and supervision and these laws or regulations, or changes to them or their enforcement could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state laws, regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect bank customers, depositors' funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. These regulations affect our revenues, lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulators continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes and the implementation of banking laws or regulations may change depending on leadership at federal banking agencies. Since many new banking rules are issued with limited interpretive guidance, we may not sufficiently comply with or anticipate the full impact of such new rules.\nFor example, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Federal Reserve, the CFPB, the Department of Justice, and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to our performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact our rating under the Community Reinvestment Act and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture changes in regulations, regulatory policies, interpretation and enforcement of statutes, regulations or policies could reduce revenues and increase compliance burdens and limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, or increase competition from non-banks offering competing financial services and products, among other things. Future legislative and regulatory initiatives cannot be fully or accurately predicted. Such proposals may impose more stringent standards than currently applicable or anticipated with respect to capital and liquidity requirements, leverage, deposit insurance and risk management requirements for depository institutions. For example, the CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over TCF Bank and its subsidiaries, and broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of the federal consumer financial laws with respect to all financial institutions that offer financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB is authorized to make rules identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The term \"abusive\" may be interpreted in changing or inconsistent ways over time. Regulatory actions that adversely impact our deposit, lending, loan collection, campus banking programs or customer opt-in preferences with respect to overdrafts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In recent years there has been an increase in the frequency of enforcement actions brought by federal banking regulators, such as the CFPB, dealing with matters such as fair lending, account fees, loan servicing and other products and services provided to customers.\nWhile we have policies and procedures designed to prevent violations of laws, regulations and regulatory policies, and to ensure compliance with new or changed laws, regulations and regulatory policies, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur, and failure to comply could result in reputational damage, remediation, disgorgement, penalties, increased capital requirements, higher deposit insurance assessments, other monetary relief, injunctive relief or changes to our business practices or operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to real properties that we may acquire.\nIn the course of our business, we may acquire properties securing loans we have originated or purchased through the foreclosure of loans that are in default. Particularly in commercial real estate lending, there is a risk that hazardous substances could be discovered on these properties. In this event, we might be required to remove these substances from the affected properties at our sole cost and expense. The cost of this removal could substantially exceed the value of the affected properties. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third-parties seeking damages for environmental contamination emanating from the site. We may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties. If we were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities or costs, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and any resulting loss.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and any resulting loss. We have established processes intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including legal and compliance, operational, reputational, strategic and market risk such as interest rate, credit, liquidity and foreign currency risk. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies. There may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. Any future breakdowns in our risk management framework could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about our customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, and in evaluating and monitoring our loan and lease portfolio on an ongoing basis, we rely on information provided to us by or on behalf of our customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of those customers and counterparties or of other third-parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate, incomplete, fraudulent or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial or business information, or the failure to receive such information on a timely basis, could result in loan and lease losses, reputational damage or other effects that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe depend on our executive officers and other key employees to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy, and we could be harmed by the unexpected loss of their services.\nWe believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our executive officers and other key employees and our ability to motivate and retain these individuals, as well as our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled employees. Competition for employees is intense, and the process of locating key personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute our business strategy may be lengthy. If we are unable to retain personnel, including our key management, who are critical to the successful integration of Legacy TCF and our future operations, we could face disruptions in our operations, loss of existing customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how, and unanticipated additional recruitment costs. If the services of any of our of key personnel should become unavailable for any reason, we may not be able to identify and hire qualified persons on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and future prospects.\nOur business needs and future growth may require us to raise additional capital, but that capital may not be available or may be dilutive.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain specified levels of capital to support our operations. We may need to raise additional capital, in the form of debt or equity, in the future to have sufficient capital resources to meet our commitments and to fund our business needs and future growth, particularly if the quality of our assets or earnings were to deteriorate significantly. In addition, we are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and on our financial performance. We cannot assure that we will be able to raise additional capital in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. Any occurrence that limits our access to capital, may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. Any inability to raise capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could be dilutive to both tangible book value and our share price.\nIn addition, an inability to raise capital when needed may subject us to increased regulatory supervision and the imposition of restrictions on our growth and business. These restrictions could negatively affect our ability to operate or further expand our operations through loan growth, acquisitions or the establishment of additional branches and may result in increases in operating expenses and reductions in revenues that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our share price.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. A diminished availability of counterparties who satisfy our credit quality requirements could negatively impact our business. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral that we hold cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan. We can give no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. A significant failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on information technology, information and data, and telecommunications systems of third-parties, and systems failures, interruptions involving these systems could have an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems, third-party servicers accounting systems and mobile and online banking platforms. We outsource some of our major systems, such as payment processing systems, and online banking platforms. While we select these third-party vendors carefully and attempt to monitor ongoing compliance with any arrangements with TCF, we do not control their actions. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new and renewal loans, gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, failure of third-parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or fraud or misconduct on the part of employees of any of these third-parties could disrupt our operations or adversely affect our reputation. Furthermore, concentration among larger third-party providers servicing large segments of the banking industry can also potentially affect wide segments of the financial industry.\nIt may be difficult for us to replace some of our third-party vendors, particularly vendors providing our core banking, debit card services and information services in a timely manner if they are unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future for any reason, and even if we are able to replace them, it may be at higher cost or result in the loss of customers. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the conversion of Legacy TCF\u2019s business to our core operating system and any future implementation of technological changes and upgrades to maintain current systems represent significant undertakings that may result in operational and customer challenges during and after implementation. Key challenges include service interruptions, transaction processing errors and system conversion delays, which may cause us to alienate customers or fail to comply with applicable laws, and may cause us to incur additional expenses, which may be substantial.\nUncertainty relating to the London Inter-bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect us.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans, or other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers, we may experience significant expenses in effecting the transition, and may be subject to disputes or litigation with customers and creditors over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe rely on quantitative models to manage certain accounting, risk management and capital planning functions.\nWe use quantitative models to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions, including estimating probable loan losses, measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable, estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, risk management and for capital planning purposes. Our modeling methodologies rely on many assumptions, historical analyses and correlations. These assumptions may be incorrect, particularly in times of market distress, and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant. Additionally, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution. Even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate, our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, bad data, misuse of data, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model\u2019s design.\nAll models have certain limitations. Reliance on models presents the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporated from models will be adversely affected due to incorrect, missing or misleading information. In addition, our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face, may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not, or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate. If our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, we may not make appropriate risk management, capital planning, or other business or financial decisions. Strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable, and as a result, we may realize losses or other lapses. Also, information that we provide to the public or regulators based on poorly designed models could be inaccurate or misleading.\nBanking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses. Some of our decisions that the regulators evaluate, including distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient. Accordingly, the failure or inadequacy of a model may result in increased regulatory scrutiny on us or may result in an enforcement action or proceeding against us by one of our regulators.\nWe are subject to examinations, challenges and rates set by tax authorities that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to federal, state and foreign income tax regulations, which often require interpretation due to their complexity. Changes in income tax regulations or tax rates, including those resulting from the enactment of Tax Reform or in how the regulations are interpreted could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In the normal course of business, we are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from taxing authorities regarding our tax positions. Taxing authorities have been aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions. These tax positions may relate to tax compliance, sales and use, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base, apportionment and tax credit planning. These challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. Although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 11992, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "TCF"}
