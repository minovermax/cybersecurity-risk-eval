{"cik": "1319947", "company": "Designer Brands Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors when evaluating Designer Brands Inc. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be negatively affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur strategy of growing our store base and digital demand could strain our resources and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nOur growth strategy in part depends on our ability to successfully open and operate new stores on a profitable basis. We also continue to invest in our digital capabilities in order to deliver a high-quality, coordinated shopping experience for our customers, which requires substantial investment in technology. This continued growth could place increased demands on our financial, managerial, operational and administrative resources. We may not achieve our planned growth on a timely and profitable basis or achieve results in new locations similar to those achieved in existing locations in prior periods.\nDuring fiscal 2019, we plan to expand the chain in North America by approximately three to eight stores, net of closures. Our ability to open and operate new stores on a timely and profitable basis depends on many factors, including our ability to identify suitable markets and sites for new store locations with financially stable co-tenants and landlords; negotiate acceptable lease terms; build-out or refurbish sites on a timely and effective basis; obtain sufficient financing and capital resources or generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fund growth; open new stores at costs not significantly greater than those anticipated; successfully open new stores in markets in which we currently have few or no stores; control the costs of other capital investments associated with store openings; hire, train and retain qualified managers and store personnel; and successfully integrate new stores into our existing infrastructure, operations, management and distribution systems or adapt such infrastructure, operations and systems to accommodate our growth. As a result, we may be unable to open new stores at the rates expected or at all. If we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy, the opening of new stores could be delayed or prevented, could cost more than anticipated and could divert resources from other areas of our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that we open new stores in our existing markets, we may experience reduced net sales in existing stores in those markets. As our store base increases, our stores will become more concentrated in the markets we serve. As a result, the number of customers and financial performance of individual stores may decline and the average sales per square foot at our stores may be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs we introduce enhancements to our e-commerce platforms, we could experience downtime or other technical issues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the growth in digital demand could result in a diversion of traffic from our stores.\nOur recent acquisitions of TSL and Camuto Group could disrupt our ongoing business and adversely impact our results of operations.\nOn May 10, 2018, we acquired the remaining interest in TSL and on November 5, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Camuto Group. Such acquisitions may disrupt our business or divert the attention of our management. Achieving the expected benefits depends in large part on our successful integration of any newly acquired operations, systems and personnel with our own in a timely and efficient manner. For example, we cannot ensure that Camuto Group will successfully be able to manage the additional volume of the retail segments' private label merchandise transitioned to it. We cannot ensure that all of our integration efforts will be completed on a timely basis, as planned, or without substantial expense, delay or other operational problems. Until we make substantial progress with our integration efforts, we also face the risk that we may not be able to effectively manage the business and achieve planned results. We may be hindered by having limited experience with the acquired businesses and limited system and reporting capabilities. Our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by pre-existing claims or liabilities, both known and unknown. In addition, the integration process may strain our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures and may also result in the diversion of management and financial resources from core business objectives. Our ability to successfully operate in Canada may be adversely affected by political, economic and social conditions beyond our control, local laws and customs, and legal and regulatory constraints, including compliance with applicable anti-corruption and currency laws and regulations. Risks inherent in our existing and future operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing operations outside of the United States, suffering possible adverse tax consequences from changes in tax laws or the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits, and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations thereof may have an adverse effect on our financial results. There can be no assurance that we will successfully\nintegrate our businesses or that we will realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions after we complete our integration efforts.\nOur failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brands.\nThe value of our brands are largely dependent on the success of our merchandise assortment and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality customer experience. Any negative publicity about us or the significant brands we offer may reduce demand for our merchandise. Failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor, health and safety, accounting or environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions. Consumer actions could include boycotts and negative publicity through social or digital media. Public perception about us or the products we carry, whether justified or not, could impair our reputation, involve us in litigation, damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on our strong relationships with vendors to purchase brand name and designer merchandise at favorable prices. If these relationships were to be impaired, we may not be able to obtain a sufficient assortment of merchandise at attractive prices, and we may not be able to respond promptly to changing fashion trends, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nOur success depends, to a significant extent, on the willingness and ability of our vendors to supply us with sufficient inventory to stock our sales channels as we generally do not have long-term supply agreements or exclusive arrangements with any vendors. If we fail to maintain strong relationships with our existing vendors or to ensure the quality of merchandise they supply us, and if we cannot maintain or acquire new vendors of in-season brand name and designer merchandise, our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise at favorable prices may be limited, which could have a negative impact on our business. Decisions by vendors to not sell to us or to limit the availability of their products to us could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, our inability to stock our sales channels with in-season merchandise at attractive prices could result in lower net sales and decreased customer interest in our sales channels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, if our merchandise costs increase due to increases incurred by our vendors in raw materials, energy, labor, or duties and taxes on imports, or other reasons, our ability to respond or the effect of our response could adversely affect our net sales or gross profit. During fiscal 2018, three key vendors together supplied approximately 20% of our retail merchandise. The loss of, or a reduction in, the amount and quality of merchandise supplied by any one of these vendors could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, any negative brand image, wide-spread product defects, or negative publicity related to these key vendors, or other vendors, could have an adverse effect on our brand reputation and on our business.\nThe success of the acquired Camuto Group business is dependent on our third-party manufacturers and other business partners.\nThe success of the acquired Camuto Group business depends on our ability to obtain products from our manufacturers on a timely basis and on acceptable terms. We do not exert direct control over the manufacturers' operations and cannot guarantee that any third-party manufacturer will have sufficient production capacity, meet our production deadlines or meet our quality standards. We typically do not have long-term supply contracts with our manufacturers, and the loss of any of our major manufacturers could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business. In addition, our manufacturers operate outside the U.S. and are subject to additional risks associated with international trade, including trade relations, work stoppages, transportation delays, costs (including duties, tariffs, inspections, and other trade restrictions), and negative trends in global economic conditions. If these third parties do not perform their obligations or are unable to provide us with the materials and services we need at prices and terms that are acceptable to us, such disruptions may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis. This would jeopardize our ability to properly merchandise and service our wholesale customers, which may, in turn, have a negative impact on our customer relationships and result in lower net sales and profits.\nThe success of the acquired Camuto Group business is dependent on the strength of our relationships with our retailer customers, and reductions in or loss of sales to such customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nThe Camuto Group business is dependent on sales of branded, licensed and private-label footwear and accessories to customers, primarily department stores and other specialty retailers. We typically do not have long-term contracts with our customers. Sales to these customers are generally on an order-by-order basis and are subject to the rights of cancellation and rescheduling by the customer. Failure to fill customers\u2019 orders in a timely manner could harm our relationships with such customers. If any of our major customers experiences a significant downturn in its business, or fails to remain committed to our products or brands,\nsuch customers may reduce or discontinue purchases from us. In addition, increased promotional activity by our wholesale customers could negatively impact the image of our brands and lead to reduced pricing or purchases of our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business. The Camuto Group business has four customers that make up approximately 60% of its total revenue, and the loss of any or all of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the Brand Portfolio segment.\nWe may be unable to anticipate and respond to fashion trends, consumer preferences and changing customer expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur merchandising strategy is based on offering the proper mix of products available to our customers, including our retailer customers. This requires us to anticipate and respond to numerous and fluctuating variables in fashion trends and other conditions in the markets in which our customers are situated. A variety of factors will affect our ability to maintain the proper mix of products, including: local economic conditions impacting customers' discretionary spending; unanticipated fashion trends; our ability to provide timely access to in-season merchandise at attractive prices; our success in distributing merchandise to our stores and our wholesale retailer customers in an efficient manner; and changes in weather patterns, which in turn affect consumer preferences. If we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of our customers, we may experience decreases in our net sales and may be forced to increase markdowns in relation to slow-moving merchandise, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBeing an omni-channel retailer is a business necessity to meet customer experience expectations and an opportunity to create a competitive advantage as our customers expect to be able to shop across multiple sales channels. In the event that our omni-channel strategy does not meet customer expectations or is not differentiated from our competitors, it may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe loss or disruption of information technology services could affect our ability to implement our growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur information technology systems are an integral part of our growth strategy in efficiently operating and expanding our business, in managing operations and protecting against security risks related to our electronic processing and transmitting of confidential customer and associate data. The requirements to keep our information technology systems operating at peak performance may be higher than anticipated and could strain our capital resources, management of any system upgrades, implementation of new systems and the related change management processes required with new systems and our ability to protect ourselves from any future information security breaches. In addition, any significant disruption of our data center could have a material adverse effect on those operations dependent on those systems, most specifically, our store and e-commerce operations, our distribution and fulfillment centers and our merchandising team. While we maintain business interruption and property insurance, in the event our data center was to be shut down, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover the impact to the business.\nWe accept orders through our e-commerce channels and are subject to various risks of operating online and mobile selling capabilities such as: the failure of our information technology infrastructure, including any third-party hardware or software, resulting in downtime or other technical issues; difficulty in integrating acquired businesses; reliance on third-party logistics providers to deliver our products to customers; inability to respond to technological changes; violations of state or federal laws; credit card fraud; or other information security breaches. Failure to mitigate these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe face security risks related to our electronic processing of sensitive and confidential personal and business data. If we are unable to protect our data, a security breach could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGiven the nature of our business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential customer and associate data, in addition to proprietary business information. We may be vulnerable to a data compromise, computer viruses, physical and electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions, which may not be prevented by our efforts to secure our computer systems. Security measures in place include, but are not limited to, vulnerability scanning and patching, web-application firewalls, reverse-proxies, network firewalls, two-factor authentication, identity and access management, data encryption, point-to-point encryption and tokenization, intrusion detection and prevention devices, endpoint detection and response software, and data loss prevention software. Regular penetration tests of our networks are conducted by a third-party service provider and we leverage any findings to further enhance our security. We also employ secure file transfer options to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential information. Our critical data is replicated and backed up to a separate secured datacenter. However, our efforts may not be able to prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks and a successful\nbreach of our computer systems could result in misappropriation of personal, payment or sensitive business information. In addition, we rely on associates, contractors and other third parties who may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Actual or anticipated attacks, as well as the integration of new or existing systems of acquired businesses, may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, pay higher insurance premiums, and engage third-party specialists for additional services. An information security breach involving confidential and personal data could damage our reputation and our customers' willingness to shop in our stores or through our e-commerce platforms. In addition, we may incur material liabilities and remediation costs as a result of an information security breach, including potential liability for stolen customer or associate data, repairing system damage or providing credit monitoring or other benefits to customers or associates affected by the breach. In the event we experience an information security breach, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover the impact to the business. Although we have developed mitigating security controls to reduce our cyber risk and protect our data from loss or disclosure due to a security breach, including processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security.\nThe loss or disruption of any of our distribution or fulfillment centers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nFor our U.S. Retail segment operations, the majority of our inventory is shipped directly from suppliers to our distribution center in Columbus, Ohio and a West Coast facility operated by a third party, where the inventory is then processed, sorted and shipped to one of our pool locations located throughout the country and then on to the stores. Our inventory can also be shipped directly from our fulfillment center, also located in Columbus, Ohio, and supported by a third-party service provider, to our customers. For our Canada Retail segment, we engage a logistics service provider to receive purchases and distribute to our stores. Through our ship from store capability, both in the U.S. and in Canada, inventory is shipped directly from our stores to customers. Through our drop ship program, inventory is shipped from the vendor's warehouse directly to the customer. For our Brand Portfolio segment, the majority of our inventory is shipped directly from factories to our distribution center in Westampton, New Jersey, where our wholesale inventory is then processed, sorted and provided to our customers' shipping carriers.\nOur operating results depend on the orderly operation of our receiving, distribution, and fulfillment processes, which in turn depends on vendors' adherence to shipping schedules and our effective management of our facilities. We may not anticipate all the changing demands that our expanding operations will impose on our receiving, distribution, and fulfillment system, and events beyond our control, such as disruptions in operations due to integration of new stores or customers, catastrophic events, labor disagreements, or shipping problems, that may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers. While we maintain business interruption and property insurance, in the event any of our distribution and fulfillment centers shut down for any reason or if we were to incur higher costs and longer lead times in connection with a disruption at our distribution and fulfillment centers, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover the impact to the business.\nIf Stein Mart were to terminate our supply agreement, close a significant number of stores or liquidate, such event could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nWe currently provide services through ABG to 286 Stein Mart stores and Steinmart.com through ongoing supply arrangements. Our contractual termination date for the supply agreement with Stein Mart is January 2020. If Stein Mart were to terminate our supply agreement, close a significant number of stores or liquidate, such event could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nThe reputation and competitive position for the acquired Camuto Group business are dependent on our ability to maintain the brands we license.\nIn partnership with Authentic Brands Group LLC, a global brand management and marketing company, we formed ABG-Camuto, a joint venture in which we have a 40% interest. This joint venture acquired several intellectual property rights from the Sellers, including Vince Camuto, Louise et Cie, Sole Society, CC Corso Como, Enzo Angiolini and others, and will focus on licensing and developing new category extensions to support the global growth of these brands. ABG-Camuto has entered into a licensing agreement with us, which will earn royalties from the net sales of Camuto Group under the brands acquired. In addition, we hold footwear licenses of Jessica Simpson and Lucky Brand.\nWe rely on our ability to retain and maintain good relationships with the licensors and their ability to maintain strong, well-recognized brands and trademarks. The terms of our license agreements vary and are subject to renewal with various termination provisions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these licenses. Even our longer-term or\nrenewable licenses are typically dependent upon our ability to market and sell the licensed products at specified levels, and the failure to meet such levels may result in the termination or non-renewal of such licenses. Furthermore, many of our license agreements require minimum royalty payments, and if we are unable to generate sufficient sales and profitability to cover these minimum royalty requirements, we may be required to make additional payments to the licensors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are constantly exploring new business opportunities and implementing initiatives. The failure to successfully execute our strategies may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe have expanded our products and markets in part through strategic acquisitions and we may continue to do so in the future. For example, in fiscal 2018, we acquired Camuto Group and the remaining equity interest in TSL. The continued development and implementation of new business opportunities and strategies involve numerous risks, including risks inherent in entering markets in which we may not have prior experience, and could distract management from our core business. In the event that we lose focus on our core business or are unsuccessful in the execution of our concept, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons, including seasonal variability.\nOur business is sensitive to consumer spending patterns, which in turn are subject to prevailing regional and national economic conditions and the general level of economic activity. Our comparable sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of other factors affect our sales and quarterly financial performance, including: uncertain macro-economic conditions and changes in the retail sales environment; changes in our merchandising strategy; timing and concentration of new store openings and related start-up costs; expenses associated with new stores, our omni-channel strategy and marketing expenses; changes in our merchandise mix; changes in and regional variations in demographic and population characteristics; timing of promotional events; seasonal fluctuations due to weather conditions; and actions by our competitors. Accordingly, our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter, and comparable sales for any particular future period may increase or decrease. Our future financial performance may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which may adversely impact the price of our common shares.\nIn addition, our business is subject to seasonal merchandise trends when our customers' interest in new seasonal styles increases. New spring styles are introduced in the first quarter and new fall styles are introduced in the third quarter. As a result of seasonal merchandise trends, any factors negatively affecting us during these periods, including adverse weather, the timing and level of markdowns, fashion trends or unfavorable economic conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to retain our existing senior management team and to continue to attract qualified new personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization, which requires an experienced and talented management team. If we were to lose the benefit of the experience, efforts and abilities of any of our key executives and buying personnel, our business could be adversely affected. We have entered into employment agreements with several key executives and also offer compensation packages designed to attract and retain talent. Furthermore, our ability to manage our expansion will require us to continue to train, motivate and develop our employees to maintain a high level of talent for future challenges and succession planning. Competition for these types of personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and\nretaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business.\nWe are dependent on our customer loyalty programs and marketing to drive traffic, sales and loyalty, and any decrease in membership or purchases from members could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCustomer traffic is influenced by our marketing and our loyalty programs. We rely on our loyalty programs to drive customer traffic, sales and purchase frequency. Loyalty members earn points toward discounts on future purchases through our DSW VIP rewards program in the U.S. and our Shoe Lovers Rewards program in Canada. Members also receive promotional offers and gifts with purchase offers. We employ a variety of marketing methods, including email, direct mail and social media, to communicate exclusive offers to our rewards members. We have approximately 30 million members enrolled in our loyalty programs who have made at least one purchase over the last two years. In fiscal 2018, shoppers in the loyalty programs generated approximately 88% of the combined U.S. Retail and Canada Retail segments' net sales. During fiscal 2018, DSW VIP was launched and replaced our previous loyalty program, with new benefits, personalized options and faster ways to earn points. We expect these changes will result in more customer activations, increase purchase frequency, and sales growth. In the\nevent that our reward members do not continue to shop, we fail to add new members, the number of members decreases, or our marketing is not effective in driving customer traffic, we could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to risks through the leasing of certain properties.\nWe lease an office space that expires in 2024, which we sublease to an unrelated third party at an annual rent that is lower than our total annual lease obligation. The sublease was renewed for a two-year term in June 2017, but that tenant can terminate at any time with 60 days' notice. In addition, we have guaranteed a lease commitment that is scheduled to expire in 2024 of a location that has been leased to a third party. In the event that any of these arrangements are not renewed or are terminated, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe have a leased office space that expires in 2020 and a leased fulfillment center that expires in 2023 related to the Ebuys business. As a result of our exit of the Ebuys business, we are marketing these locations to third parties to assume or sublease. Also, we have other leased space that is unoccupied as a result of the exit of the Town Shoes banner stores in Canada and certain locations we assumed as part of the Camuto Group acquisition. We cannot assure that we will be able to assign or sublease any of these properties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Relating to the External Environment\nWe may be unable to compete in our highly competitive market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe footwear market is highly competitive with few barriers to entry. We compete against a diverse group of manufacturers and retailers, both small and large, including department stores, mall-based shoe stores, national chains, independent shoe retailers, single-brand specialty retailers, online shoe retailers, brand-oriented discounters, multi-channel specialty retailers and brand suppliers. In addition, our wholesale retailer customers sell shoes purchased from competing footwear suppliers with owned and licensed brands that are well-known. Many of these suppliers invest significantly in marketing their brands. Our success depends on our ability to remain competitive with respect to assortment, quality, convenience and value. The performance of our competitors, as well as a change in their pricing policies as a result of the current economic environment, marketing activities and other business strategies, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nE-commerce networks have rapidly evolved while consumer receptiveness to shopping online has substantially increased. Competition from e-commerce players has significantly increased due to their ability to provide improved user experience, greater ease of buying goods, low or no shipping fees, faster shipping times and more favorable return policies. Businesses, including our suppliers, can easily launch online sites and mobile platforms at nominal costs by using commercially available software or partnering with any of a number of successful digital marketplace providers. Some of our suppliers use such platforms to compete with us by allowing consumers to purchase products directly through the supplier. Competitors with other revenue sources may also be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote more resources to websites, mobile platforms and applications and systems development.\nWe rely on foreign sources for our merchandise, and our business is therefore subject to risks associated with international trade.\nAll of the Camuto Group products are manufactured outside the U.S., whereas our retail merchandise is purchased from both domestic and foreign vendors. However, many of our domestic vendors import a large portion of their merchandise from abroad. We believe almost all of our merchandise was manufactured outside the U.S., with the majority manufactured in China. For this reason, we face risks inherent in purchasing from foreign suppliers, such as: economic and political instability in countries where these suppliers are located; international hostilities or acts of war or terrorism affecting the U.S. or foreign countries from which our merchandise is sourced; increases in shipping costs; transportation delays and interruptions, including increased inspections of import shipments by domestic authorities; work stoppages; expropriation or nationalization; changes in foreign government administration and governmental policies; changes in import duties or quotas; compliance with trade and foreign tax laws; and local business practices, including compliance with foreign laws and with domestic and international labor standards. We also face risks and uncertainty relating to escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and other countries, as well as U.S. laws affecting the importation of goods, such as recent tariffs imposed on Chinese goods imported to the U.S. Such events may increase our costs and disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe require our business partners to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our internal requirements. However, we do not control such third parties or their labor and business practices. The violation of labor or other laws by one of our vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUncertainty in future changes to tax legislation, regulatory reform or policies could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nTax laws, regulations, and policies in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic, political and other conditions. The U.S. tax reform legislation referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"U.S. Tax Reform\") significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations and requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in U.S. tax law. The U.S. Treasury Department, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Reform will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. In addition, state, local or foreign jurisdictions may enact tax laws in response to the U.S. Tax Reform that could result in further changes to taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nUncertain economic conditions and other events in the United States and other countries in which we operate, can adversely affect consumer confidence and consumer spending habits, which could result in reduced net sales.\nConsumer spending habits, including spending for the footwear and accessories that we sell, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions; levels of employment; salaries and wage rates; prevailing interest rates; income tax rates and policies; consumer confidence; and consumer perception of economic conditions. In addition, consumer purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers' disposable income. Consumer confidence can also be affected by the domestic or international political environment. The outbreak or escalation of war, natural disasters, or the occurrence of terrorist acts or other hostilities in or affecting the United States or other countries in which we operate, could lead to a decrease in spending by consumers. In an economic slowdown, we could experience lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis and be forced to delay or slow our expansion plans. Reduced net sales may result in reduced operating cash flows if we are not able to appropriately manage inventory levels or leverage expenses. These negative economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRestrictions in our Credit Facility could limit our operational flexibility.\nOn August 25, 2017, we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the \"Credit Facility\") with a maturity date of August 25, 2022 that replaced our previous secured revolving credit agreement and letter of credit agreement. On October 10, 2018, the Credit Facility was amended to include the acquisition of Camuto Group as a permitted acquisition and, following the acquisition, to utilize an accordion feature that provided for an increase to the revolving line of credit. On November 5, 2018, following the acquisition of Camuto Group, the amended Credit Facility was increased with no change to the sub-limits. The Credit Facility provides a revolving line of credit up to $400 million, with sub-limits for the issuance of up to $50 million in letters of credit, swing loan advances of up to $15 million, and the issuance of up to $75 million in foreign currency revolving loans and letters of credit. The Credit Facility may be used to provide funds for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases, other expenditures, and permitted acquisitions as defined by the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on indebtedness, liens and investments, as well as the maintenance of a leverage ratio not to exceed 3.25:1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio not to be less than 1.75:1. A violation of any of the covenants could result in a default under the Credit Facility that would permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access the Credit Facility for loans and letters of credit and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans under the Credit Facility. As a result of the acquisition of Camuto Group, we have elected to increase the leverage ratio whereby we must maintain a leverage ratio not to exceed 3.50:1 as of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and for the subsequent three quarters.\nOur cash and investments are subject to risks that could affect the liquidity of these investments.\nAs of February 2, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents and investments of $169.1 million. A portion of these are held as cash in operating accounts that are with financial institutions. While we regularly monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and when possible adjust the balances as appropriate to be within Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits, these cash balances could be lost or inaccessible if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets.\nWhile we generally invest in lower risk investments, investment risk has been and may further be exacerbated by credit and liquidity issues that have affected various sectors of the financial markets. Our access to cash and investments, their earning potential or our ability to invest in highly rated, low risk investments may be impacted by adverse conditions in the U.S. financial markets. These market risks associated with our cash and investments could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk.\nWe are primarily exposed to the impact of foreign exchange rate risk through our Canadian business where the functional currency is the Canadian dollar (\"CAD\"). Currency translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. We also hold cash denominated in CAD with foreign currency exchange gains or losses recorded to income. The impact of all other foreign currencies is immaterial to our financial results and we currently do not utilize hedging instruments to mitigate foreign currency exchange risks.\nRisks Relating to our Common Shares\nOur amended articles of incorporation, amended and restated code of regulations and Ohio state law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Designer Brands Inc. This could adversely affect the value of our common shares.\nOur amended articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue up to 100,000,000 preferred shares and to determine the powers, preferences, privileges, rights, including voting rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions on those shares, without any further vote or action by the shareholders. The rights of the holders of our Class A common shares will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred shares that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred shares could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control and could adversely affect the voting power of our common shares.\nIn addition, provisions of our amended articles of incorporation, amended and restated code of regulations and Ohio law, together or separately, could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in control or limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common shares. Among other things, these provisions establish a staggered board, require a super-majority vote to remove directors, and establish certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders' meetings.\nWe do not expect a trading market for the Company's Class B common shares to develop and therefore any investment in the Class B common shares may be effectively illiquid, unless such shares are converted into the Company's Class A common shares.\nThere is currently no public market for the Company's Class B common shares. We do not intend to list the Class B common shares on any securities exchange or any automated quotation system. As a result, there can be no assurance that a secondary market will develop, and we do not expect any market makers to participate in a secondary market. Because the Class B common shares are not listed on a securities exchange or an automated quotation system, it may be difficult to obtain pricing information with respect to the shares. Accordingly, there may be a limited number of buyers if a holder decided to sell their Class B common shares. This may affect the price a holder would receive upon such sale. Alternatively, a holder of such shares could convert them into Class A common shares, on a share for share basis, prior to selling.
