Thus, an investment in our stock is also subject to risk. The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements that are contained in this Annual Report, as well as certain of our other filings made or to be made with the SEC. Any of the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, the trading price of our stock and/or the outcome of matters with respect to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report.\nThe risk factors have been separated into four groups: (1) Macroeconomic and Industry Risks; (2) Operational Risks; (3) Capital Risks; and (4) Legal and Regulatory Risks. Based upon information currently known to us, the Company believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our Company and our securities. The risk factors described below should not be construed as an exhaustive list of all the risks we face nor are they listed in order of the likelihood that the risk may occur or the severity of the impact if the risk should occur. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report.\nWe operate in a continually changing business environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time. There can be no assurance that we have identified, assessed and appropriately addressed all risks affecting our business operations. Additional risks and uncertainties could adversely affect our business, operational results, financial position, liquidity and cash flows.\n1.\nMACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKS\nGeneral economic conditions in the U.S. may adversely affect our business.\nAll of our stores are located within the U.S., making us highly susceptible to macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the United States. Apparel retailing is a volatile industry that is highly dependent upon the overall level of consumer spending and consumer confidence. Because apparel purchases are frequently discretionary, declines in consumer spending or customer confidence may have a more negative effect on apparel retailers than on other types of retailers.\nIn addition, there is a risk that consumer purchases of apparel may decline as a result of market disruptions caused by severe or unseasonable weather conditions, natural disasters, public health concerns, terrorist activities, political crises or other major events or the prospect of these events. Such macroeconomic and other factors could have a negative effect on consumer spending in the U.S., which in turn could have a material effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nThe ability to attract customers to our stores depends heavily on customer traffic at malls and centers in which our stores are located.\nThe majority of our stores are located in shopping malls and other retail centers. Sales at these stores are derived in considerable part from the volume of traffic generated in those malls or retail centers and surrounding areas. The continued decrease in traffic at malls and shopping centers where our stores are located and/or, the closing of anchor stores important to driving mall traffic could result in lower sales and leave us with excess inventory and/or unprofitable stores. In such circumstances, we may have to respond by increasing markdowns or initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory or in some cases, close an underperforming store, which could adversely impact our revenues, financial results, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing all of our store locations.\nWe currently lease all of our store locations. Our leases range from month-to-month to approximately ten years in length. A number of our leases have early termination provisions that apply if we do not achieve specified sales levels, such that we or the landlord may terminate the lease or alternatively we may seek to re-negotiate rent if we do not achieve such sales levels. The leases for approximately 38% of our store base expire during Fiscal 2020 (February 2, 2020 to January 30, 2021), including those leases which are month-to-month. We believe that, over the last few years, we have generally been able to negotiate favorable rental rates. Going forward we may need to close additional stores if we fail to achieve certain sales levels or we may not be able to renew our leases on as favorable terms or terms which we deem acceptable. In addition, given the favorable terms we have negotiated for a number of our leases, the landlords may choose to exercise a reversion right in order to rent to another entity that is prepared to pay higher rents. As a result, we may need to pay higher occupancy costs or close stores, which could adversely impact our financial performance, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. In addition, economic conditions could negatively impact the Company's retail landlords, particularly class C & D quality malls where the majority of our brick-and-mortar stores are located. That, in turn, could affect these retail landlords' ability to maintain their shopping centers, including a high level of sustained occupancy, and otherwise perform their obligations, which could negatively impact customer traffic, our sales, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe have, and will continue to have, significant lease obligations. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to fulfill our obligations under the applicable lease including paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term, paying the unamortized value of landlord-funded leasehold improvements, and we may be required to write off capital improvements we funded at that location. Additionally, continued consolidation in the commercial retail real estate market could affect our ability to successfully negotiate favorable rental terms for our stores in the future and could concentrate our leases with fewer landlords who may then be in a position to dictate less favorable terms to us due to their significant negotiating leverage. If we are unable to enter into new leases or renew existing leases on terms acceptable to us or be released from our obligations under leases for stores that are underperforming, that could have a material effect on our business, operational results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nFundamental shifts in the retail industry and the competitive environment could impact our revenues, operational results and market share.\nThe women's specialty retail apparel business is highly competitive. We believe we compete primarily with department stores, specialty stores, discount stores, mass merchandisers, and on-line businesses that sell women's apparel. Many of our competitors are significantly larger with greater resources available to them, may offer a broader selection of merchandise than we do, and have greater brand recognition and comparatively lower costs of operations. They also may be able to adapt to changes in customer preferences more quickly, as well as respond faster to economic, operational, regulatory or organizational changes. In addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable store locations, lease terms and qualified associates. Increased competition in any of these areas could result in higher costs, which could reduce our revenue, gross margins and operating income.\nThe growth and prominence of off-price and value-fashion retailers has fundamentally shifted customers\u2019 expectations as to affordable pricing of apparel. In addition, the rise of these retailers as well as the shift in shopping preferences away from brick-and-mortar stores to the internet, where online-only businesses or those with robust direct channel capabilities can facilitate competitive entry and comparison shopping in our brands, have increased the challenge of maintaining or gaining market share. The Company\u2019s execution of its own omni-channel strategy to adapt to these changes, in relation to its competitors\u2019 actions as well as to our customers\u2019 adoption of new technology, presents a specific risk. Further, unanticipated changes in pricing and other practices of the Company\u2019s competitors, including various types of promotions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs on apparel or accessories or an escalation in the current trade war with China, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and cash flow.\nGiven the current state of apparel manufacturing in the United States, almost all of our merchandise is produced in foreign countries, with the majority produced in China, making the price and availability of our merchandise susceptible to international trade risks and other international conditions. The introduction of tariffs in 2018 by the United States government sparked a trade war between the United States and China and other countries that poses challenges to the U.S. economy. We rely heavily on imported merchandise to supply our stores with products. The imposition of additional tariffs, duties, border adjustment taxes or other trade restrictions by the United States could also result in the adoption of new or increased tariffs or other trade restrictions by other countries. In response to the recent tariffs imposed by the current U.S. administration, the Company has reduced the amount of goods being produced in China; however, China still produces a majority of the Company's apparel. Tariffs on the levels imposed in 2019 are generally too large for retailers to absorb on a long-term basis, meaning they are ultimately passed on, in whole or in part, to consumers in the form of higher prices. If the current administration imposes additional tariffs if or trade restrictions are implemented by the United States or other countries, the resulting trade barriers could have a significant adverse impact on our cost of goods, the price at which we offer them for sale, the demand for our goods and on our business, operating results, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe are not able to predict future trade policy of the United States or of any foreign countries in which we produce goods, or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements, or their impact on our business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions and tariffs, quotas and embargoes, the continuance of the current or a new trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies, has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers buying habits, our suppliers and the world economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position, liquidity and cash flows.\nInstability in the shipping industry or a shortage of qualified truck drivers could increase our costs, result in delays in the receipt or loss of merchandise and adversely impact our results of operations.\nWhile we do not rely on a single ocean carrier company to transport our goods, disruption or instability among transportation carriers could result in reduced capacity, increased rates, delay in the receipt of or the loss of goods. This, in turn, could increase our costs, result in lost sales or sales at lower margins negatively impacting our operations, financial results, cash flows and liquidity. In addition, a shortage of qualified truck drivers has impacted the trucking industry, causing delays and increases in prices. While the Company transports most of its imports by rail, the driver shortage could make it more difficult to hire trucks to transport rail shipments to us. If that were to occur, it would likely increase our costs, and possibly delay receipt of merchandise which in turn could lead to lost sales or sales at lower margins negatively impacting our operations, financial results, cash flows and liquidity.\nExtreme and/or unseasonable weather conditions in the United States could have a disproportionate effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nExtreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. For example, inclement weather or extreme conditions can make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores, result in temporary store closures and/or reduced hours of operation and may cause a disruption in the shipment or receipt of merchandise. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of our merchandise offerings incompatible with those unseasonable conditions in the affected areas. Such unseasonable weather conditions could have an adverse effect on our sales, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nActs of terrorism, natural disasters, acts of war, other catastrophes or political unrest could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe threat, or actual acts, of terrorism continue to be a significant risk to the global economy. Terrorism and potential military responses, political unrest, natural disasters, pandemics and other health issues have disrupted or could in the future disrupt commerce, limit the ability of factories to produce our goods, impact our ability to operate our stores, corporate office or distribution centers in the affected areas or impact our ability to provide critical functions or services necessary to the operation of our business. A disruption of commerce, or an inability to recover critical functions or services from such a disruption, could interfere with the production, shipment or receipt of our merchandise in a timely manner or increase our costs to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operational results, financial position, liquidity and cash flows. In addition, any of the above disruptions could undermine consumer confidence, which could negatively impact consumer spending or customer traffic, and thus have an adverse effect on our operational results.\nOur ability to mitigate the adverse impact of any of the above disruptions also depends, in part, upon the effectiveness of our planning and response. However, we cannot be certain that our plans will be adequate or implemented properly in the event of an actual disaster or other catastrophic situation.\nCosts of raw materials, commodities, transportation or labor may rise resulting in an increase in component and delivery costs, and overall product costs, all of which could erode margins and impact our profitability.\nThe raw materials and labor used to manufacture our products, and our transportation and contract manufacturing labor costs are subject to availability constraints and price volatility. The results of our business operations could suffer due to significant increases or volatility in the prices of certain commodities, including but not limited to cotton, synthetics and other items used in the production of our apparel, as well as increases in fuel, oil, natural gas or labor costs as well as shortages of skilled labor. Price increases of these items or other inflationary pressures may result in significant cost increases for our raw materials, product components and finished products, as well as increases in the cost of distributing merchandise to our retail locations. To the extent that we cannot offset increases in the cost of goods with other cost reductions or improved operating efficiencies or the sale of products at higher prices and with the desired level of gross margin, it could have a negative effect on our gross profits. Additionally, substantially increased uncertainty with respect to trade relations, such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, could result in trade wars, higher barriers and tariffs, and higher product costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position, cash flows and liquidity.\nA significant portion of our manufacturing and fabric/yarn production is concentrated in China and as a result, is subject to risks related to health epidemics such as the COVID-19 Coronavirus.\nAn outbreak of a contagious disease or other adverse public health developments in countries where the factories we use are located, or where the fabric/yarn we use is produced, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. For example, the recent outbreak of a novel strain of COVID-19 Coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, has resulted in significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of the virus, including restrictions on manufacturing and the movement of employees in many regions of the country. This has affected the facilities of our suppliers and the fabric/yarn mills that we use. While the closures and limitations in movement in the region are expected to be temporary, the duration of the product and supply chain disruption and related financial impact cannot be estimated at this time. The extent to which the COVID-19 Coronavirus pandemic will impact our business, financial results, liquidity and cash flows will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Should the manufacturing and fabric/yarn facilities remain closed or underutilized for an extended period of time, the impact on the production of products we sell could have a material adverse impact on our results of operation, cash flows and liquidity. In addition, the COVID-19 Coronavirus may result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economy and financial markets of a number of countries resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our apparel and accessories and our stock price. As a result, at the time of this filing, it is impossible to predict the overall impact of the COVID-19 Coronavirus on our business and financial results.\nThe COVID-19 Coronavirus disease, which began in China, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and recently has spread to the United States and many other parts of the world and may adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flow.\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 Coronavirus continues to grow both in the U.S. and globally and related government and private sector responsive actions may adversely affect our business operations. It is impossible to predict the effect and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as the situation is rapidly evolving.\nWhile it appears that COVID-19 Coronavirus outbreak in the United States is in the early stages, the recent downturn in financial market indices appear to have been primarily driven by uncertainties associated with the pandemic. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the potential adverse effect of the pandemic on the economy, our supply chain partners, travel and transportation services, our employees and customers, customer sentiment in general, and traffic within the shopping centers containing our stores. The pandemic could adversely affect our near-term and long-term revenues, earnings, liquidity and cash flows and may require significant actions in response including but not limited to employee furloughs, reduced store hours, store closings, expense reductions or discounting of the pricing of our products, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts. This situation is changing rapidly, and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\n2. OPERATIONAL RISKS\nImproving our store productivity will be largely dependent upon the performance of our missy, petite and women\u2019s format (\u201cMPW stores\u201d) including our outlet stores.\nImproving the performance of our existing stores and optimizing our store productivity is critical to improving our sales and returning to consistent profitability. Over the past six years, the Company has opened a number of outlet stores and converted existing C&B and C.J. Banks\u2019 stores into MPW stores. At fiscal year-end, approximately 86% of our stores (including outlets) were in the MPW format. If we are unable to improve the overall performance and store productivity of the MPW stores, our revenues, margins, liquidity, cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business underwent a number of leadership changes in the last several years resulting in changes to our strategies and tactical initiatives. If we do not successfully implement and adapt to these changes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nKeri L. Jones joined the Company as Chief Executive Officer in mid-March 2018. In July of 2018 we hired a new Chief Financial Officer and a new Chief Merchandising Officer, in December 2018 a new Chief Stores Officer and in June 2019 a new Chief Marketing Officer. In connection with these changes in management, there have been changes to the Company\u2019s operations and also to some of our key strategies and tactical initiatives. If we do not successfully implement and adapt to these changes they may not lead to the desired improvement in our business and results of operation. This in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to increase sales and achieve and sustain an acceptable level of gross margin, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, profitability, liquidity and cash flows.\nDespite the improvement in our financial results in the second half of the fiscal year, our overall results for the entire fiscal year were below our expectations. Our ability to improve our performance in our key financial metrics is subject to a variety of challenges. If we cannot increase our overall net sales, our comparable store sales and improve our gross margin rate; it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur Fiscal 2020 plan to improve the Company\u2019s financial performance is dependent upon our ability to successfully implement our strategic and tactical initiatives.\nThe Company\u2019s Fiscal 2020 operational plan contemplates growth in comparable store sales; gross margin rate improvement and positive cash flow, all of which is intended to result in improved financial results as compared to Fiscal 2019. We plan to achieve this through a variety of initiatives, including enhancing and simplifying her shopping experience, executing a disciplined promotional strategy, continuing to expand our omni-channel capabilities, building our customer base and reducing our cost structure. Our ability to achieve this plan depends upon a variety of factors, including a number of factors that are beyond our control. If we are unable to successfully implement and execute the strategic and tactical initiatives underlying our Fiscal 2020 plan, our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nOur sales and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to attract, retain or recruit key personnel as well as attract, develop and retain qualified employees.\nOur performance is highly dependent on attracting and retaining qualified employees, including our new executives, and other key personnel. A significant amount of turnover of management employees with specific knowledge relating to our operations and industry could result in a loss of organizational focus and an inability to identify or properly execute key strategies and tactical initiatives. Also, if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales associates at acceptable wage levels that may impair our efficiency and effectiveness in serving our customers and in generating sales. That, in turn, could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe may be unable to maintain our brand image, engage new and existing customers or gain market share.\nOur ability to maintain our brand image and reputation is integral to our business as well as the implementation of strategies to expand it. Maintaining, promoting and growing our brand will depend largely on the success of our merchandising and marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality customer experience that retains existing customers and attracts a sufficient level of new customers to shop our brand, both in-store and online. In addition, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives for any of our brands. Our ability to address the challenges of declining store traffic at our brick-and-mortar stores, in a highly promotional, low growth environment may impact our ability to maintain or gain market share and also impact our sales, business, operational results, financial position, liquidity and cash flows.\nFurther, the use of social media by the Company and consumers has also increased the risk that the Company\u2019s image and reputation could be negatively impacted. The availability of information, reviews and opinions on social media is immediate, as is its impact. The opportunity for dissemination of information, including inaccurate and inflammatory information and opinion, is nearly infinite. Even if we react quickly and appropriately to negative social media about us or our brands, our reputation and customers\u2019 perception of our brands could be negatively impacted. Damage to the brand image and reputation of the Company in any aspect of its operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nOur business depends on effective marketing, advertising and promotional programs.\nCustomer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by our advertising, marketing, promotional, digital and social media activities, the name recognition and reputation of our brands, and the location and service offered in our stores. Although we use marketing, advertising and promotional programs to attract customers through various media, including affiliate programs, digital ads and social media, our competitors may spend more or use different approaches, which could provide them with a competitive advantage. If our marketing, advertising and promotional expenses increase, if our programs become less effective than that of our competitors, or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytic capabilities needed to generate concise and effective competitive insight, our business, operational results, financial position, liquidity and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nCustomer tastes and fashion apparel trends tend to change rapidly. Our ability to anticipate or react to changing consumer preferences in a timely and accurate manner and offer a compelling product at an attractive price impacts our sales, gross margins, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nAmong other things, our success depends on our ability to consistently gauge and respond on a timely basis to fashion trends and customer preferences. Forecasting consumer demand for our merchandise and allocating the optimal amount and sizes of such merchandise to individual stores and to our eCommerce business can be challenging. In addition, our merchandise assortment differs from season to season. This may involve changes in our overall mix of fashion versus core merchandise which, in turn, may impact our overall product cost as the average unit cost of fashion product is generally higher than that of core product. Because the lead times required for many of our design and purchase decisions must be made well in advance of the applicable selling season, we are vulnerable to changes in consumer trends, customer confidence, customer preferences, price shifting, and the optimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases.\nIf we are unable to successfully identify or react to changing styles or trends or misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines, our sales and gross margins may be less than planned and the Company may be faced with a significant amount of unsold finished goods inventory. In response, the Company may be forced to increase its marketing promotions or price markdowns, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOn the other hand, if we underestimate demand for our merchandise, we may experience inventory shortages, resulting in missed sales opportunities and lost revenues.\nThere are risks associated with our eCommerce business.\nWe sell merchandise over the Internet through our web site, www.christopherandbanks.com, which represents a growing percentage of our overall net sales. The successful operation of our eCommerce business depends on our ability to maintain the continuous operation of our eCommerce website and our fulfillment operations, and to provide an on-line shopping experience that will generate both orders and return visits to our site. Our eCommerce operations are subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndisruption to the Internet;\n\u2022\nunanticipated operating problems;\n\u2022\nrapid technological change;\n\u2022\nthe successful implementation of, and costs to implement, new systems and upgrades; including those related to the operation of our website platform;\n\u2022\ninability to maintain efficient and uninterrupted order-taking and fulfillment processes;\n\u2022\nreliance on third parties with respect to the operation of the website, order fulfillment and customer service and such third parties' infrastructure;\n\u2022\ndiversion of sales from our stores;\n\u2022\nliability for online content;\n\u2022\nlack of compliance with, or violations of, applicable state or federal laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nincreased or unfavorable governmental regulation of eCommerce (which may include regulation of privacy, data protection, eCommerce payment services, content, accessibility and other related subjects);\n\u2022\ncredit card fraud;\n\u2022\nthe ability to process credit card transactions;\n\u2022\nsystem failures or disruptions and security breaches and the costs to address and remedy such failures, disruptions or breaches;\n\u2022\ncomputer viruses or malware;\n\u2022\nlack of sufficient levels of inventory of product or sizes to meet online demand;\n\u2022\nuntimely delivery of our merchandise to our customers by third parties; and\n\u2022\nincreases in shipping costs.\nIf we fail to successfully address and respond to these risks, it could negatively impact our brand and reputation and have a material adverse effect on our eCommerce sales, operating results, financial position, liquidity and cash flows. There also can be no assurance that our eCommerce operations will meet our sales and profitability plans, and the failure to do so also could negatively impact our revenues, earnings, cash flows and liquidity.\nIf we are unable to successfully implement and optimize our omni-channel retail strategy, our financial results would be adversely affected.\nWe are committed to growing our business through our omni-channel retail strategy. Our omni-channel initiatives include exploring additional ways to develop an omni-channel shopping experience, including further direct channel integration, use of advance analytics, customer personalization, and the assessment and implementation of emerging technologies. These initiatives involve significant investments in information technology systems, operational changes, and employee resources. Our goal is to offer our customers seamless access to our brands and merchandise whenever and wherever she chooses to shop. In that regard, the Company in Fiscal 2018 implemented \u201cbuy on-line, ship to store\u201d, and \u201cbuy anywhere, ship from store\u201d and in Fiscal 2019 launched \u201cbuy on-line pick up in store\u201d.\nOur success in the omni-channel arena also depends on our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in sales and marketing strategies to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs and on our third-party service provider's ability to adapt to and implement system improvements in response. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omni-channel programs, some of which may be more successful than our own. Failing to successfully implement and optimize our omni-channel retail strategy or if we do not realize our expected return on our investment in these initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur reliance on foreign sources of production poses various risks.\nBecause a significant portion of our merchandise is produced overseas, primarily in China, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Vietnam, we are subject to the additional risks of doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, such as:\n\u2022\nthe ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner;\n\u2022\ndelays in the delivery of cargo;\n\u2022\ntariffs on goods produced in a particular country;\n\u2022\nnew and additional U.S. government initiatives may be proposed or implemented that may have an impact on the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions that, if enacted, could increase the cost of products purchased from suppliers in such countries or restrict the importation of products from such countries;\n\u2022\nviolation of applicable laws or regulations including but not limited to violations under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws or regulations by us, our subsidiaries or our local agents;\n\u2022\nthe adoption of new legislation or regulations in the U.S or foreign countries that make it more difficult, more costly or impossible to continue our foreign activities;\n\u2022\nfinancial or political instability in any of the countries in which our merchandise is manufactured;\n\u2022\nsignificant fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies or restrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022\nsupply chain security initiatives undertaken by the United States or foreign governments that delay or impede the delivery of imports and the normal flow of product;\n\u2022\ndelayed receipt or non-delivery of goods due to the failure of suppliers to comply with applicable import regulations;\n\u2022\ndelayed receipt or non-delivery of goods due to labor strikes or unexpected or significant port congestion at United States or foreign ports;\n\u2022\npotential recalls or cancellations of orders for any merchandise that does not meet our quality standards;\n\u2022\ninability to meet our production needs due to labor shortages; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, extreme weather, political or military conflicts, terrorism, disease epidemics and public health related concerns, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and embargoing or increased scrutiny (and the resulting delays) of goods produced in affected areas.\nAny of the foregoing factors, or a combination of them, could increase our costs or result in our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise, thereby negatively impacting our sales, gross profit, operating income, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nIt is also possible that restrictions on or the inability of our suppliers to access credit may cause them or their factors to extend less favorable terms to us, which could adversely affect our cash flows, gross margins, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, delays by our vendors in supplying our inventory needs could cause us to incur more expensive transportation charges, which may adversely affect our margins.\nA significant portion of our merchandise is ordered through a small number of suppliers and our business could suffer if we needed to replace them.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. Instead we depend on independent third parties to manufacture our merchandise. For the most recently completed fiscal year, our ten largest suppliers accounted for approximately 66% of the merchandise we purchased, and we purchased 14% and 9% of our goods, respectively, from our two largest suppliers.\nWe generally maintain non-exclusive relationships with the suppliers that manufacture our merchandise, and we compete with other companies for production facilities. As a result, we have no contractual assurances of continued supply or pricing, and any supplier, including our key suppliers, could discontinue selling to us at any time. Moreover, a key supplier may not be able to supply our inventory needs due to capacity constraints, financial instability or other factors beyond our control, or we could decide to stop using a supplier due to quality or other performance or cost issues. If we determine to cease doing business with one or more of our key suppliers or if a key supplier becomes unable to supply desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on acceptable terms, we could experience delays in the receipt of inventory until alternative supply arrangements are secured; such delays could result in lost sales and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nIf third parties with whom we do business do not adequately perform, or are unable or unwilling to perform, we might experience disruptions in our business, resulting in decreased profits, or losses, and damage to our reputation.\nWe depend upon independent third parties, both domestic and foreign, for the manufacture of all of the goods that we sell. The inability of a manufacturer to ship orders in a timely manner or to meet our standards could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including vendors, suppliers, service providers and lenders, pursuant to which such third parties have performance, payment and other obligations to us. In some cases, the Company depends upon such third parties to provide essential products, services or other benefits in order to operate the Company\u2019s business in the ordinary course.\nAdverse economic, industry or market conditions could result in an increased risk to the Company associated with the potential financial distress or insolvency of such third parties. Failure by any of these third parties to perform these functions effectively, properly and timely, or any disruption in our business relationships with any of these third parties, could negatively impact our operations, profitability, cash flows and reputation.\nOur business and reputation could suffer if one or more of our suppliers or the factories they use fails to comply with applicable laws, follow acceptable labor practices or is accused of such non-compliance.\nOur success depends, in part, on the suppliers of our goods and the factories that they use to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to comply with our vendor code of conduct. Each of our purchase orders requires adherence to accepted labor practices, applicable laws and compliance with our vendor code of conduct. However, we do not supervise or control our suppliers or the factories that produce the merchandise we sell, or their labor and business practices. We rely on the staff of third-party auditing services and our non-exclusive buying agents to periodically visit and monitor the operations of a number of our independent factories to, among other things, assess compliance with our vendor code of conduct and applicable laws. Moreover, apparel companies can, in some cases, be held jointly liable for the wrongdoings of the suppliers of their products. In addition, we cannot control the public\u2019s perceptions of such suppliers or factories, even if they are compliant with applicable law but are nonetheless viewed in a negative light by the public. Their failure to comply with our vendor code of conduct, applicable laws or to otherwise avoid creating negative consumer perceptions about their manufacturing methods and work environment, could damage our reputation, interrupt or disrupt the shipment of products, result in a decrease in customer traffic to our stores and website, and adversely affect our sales and consequently our operating results, cash flow and liquidity.\nThere are risks relating to the operation of the ports through which our goods are shipped and to the transportation of our merchandise to our distribution center, to our eCommerce fulfillment center, to our stores, and to our eCommerce customers.\nThe vast majority of the apparel we sell is shipped by ocean from overseas. There are risks associated with a disruption in the operation of ports through which our products are shipped, which are primarily ports on the West Coast. If that were to occur, we are likely to experience delays in the receipt of products, and we or our suppliers may have to find alternative shipping methods, possibly at greater expense and costs as shipping by air is significantly more expensive.\nSimilarly shipping to alternate destinations in the United States could lead to increased lead times and overall costs for our products. We currently rely upon independent third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our merchandise shipments, including shipments to our distribution center, our stores, our eCommerce fulfillment center and our eCommerce customers. Our use of outside delivery services for shipments is subject to a variety of risks which may impact a shipper's ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs at an acceptable cost. If we change shipping companies, we could face logistical difficulties that could adversely impact deliveries and we would incur costs and expend resources in connection with such a change. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those received from the independent third-party transportation providers we currently use, which would increase our costs. If we were to experience any of these risks, it could adversely affect our costs, results of operations, gross profit, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe depend on a single facility to conduct our operations and distribute our merchandise. Our business could suffer a material adverse effect if this facility\u2019s operations was shut down or severely disrupted.\nOur corporate headquarters, data center and our only distribution facility are located in one facility in Plymouth, Minnesota which facility is more than 45 years old. Our distribution facility supplies merchandise to our retail stores and our third-party eCommerce fulfillment center. Any serious disruption to our distribution facility or a facility closure for any reason, could delay shipments to stores and our eCommerce fulfillment center and result in inventory shortages which could negatively impact our sales, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our main data center and all of our senior management, including critical resources dedicated to merchandising, operations, marketing, finance, human resources, legal, information technology and administrative functions, are located at our corporate headquarters. In the event of a disaster or other calamity impacting our corporate facility or data center, our management and staff would have to find and operate out of other suitable locations and/or rely on alternative sources for computer, telecommunications and data storage systems. We have little experience operating essential functions away from our main corporate office and are uncertain what effect operating such satellite facilities might have on business, personnel and results of operations.\nAlthough we maintain business interruption and property insurance, we cannot be assured that our insurance coverage will be sufficient or that any insurance proceeds will be timely paid to us if our distribution center or corporate office were shut down for any unplanned reason.\nWe are heavily dependent on our information technology systems and our ability to maintain and upgrade these systems from time-to-time and operate them in a secure manner.\nThe efficient operation of our business is heavily dependent on our information technology systems (\u201cIT systems\u201d). In particular, we rely (i) on point-of-sale terminals, which provide information to our host analysis systems used to track sales and inventory; (ii) on our eCommerce website through which we sell merchandise to our customers and (iii) on a third party to process payroll for our employees. Although our data is backed up and securely stored off-site, our main data center is located at our headquarters in Plymouth, Minnesota. The data center and our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption due to a variety of factors.\nThe reliability and capacity of our IT systems (including third-party hardware and software systems or services) are critical to our continued operations. Despite our precautionary efforts, our IT systems, as well as those of our services providers, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including natural or man-made disasters, technical malfunctions, inadequate systems capacity, power outages, computer viruses, malicious human acts, security breaches and similar disruptive problems, which may require significant investment to eliminate, fix or replace, and we may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays to our operations.\nAny disruption in the operation of our IT systems, our inability to maintain sufficient staffing levels, the loss of key employees knowledgeable about such systems or our failure to continue to effectively integrate, monitor and enhance such systems could interrupt our operations resulting in the temporary loss of or ability to access data or interfere with our ability to sell goods at our stores, which could result in reduced sales and affect our operations and financial performance. In addition, any interruption in the operation of our website could cause us to lose sales due to the temporary inability of customers to purchase merchandise through our website.\nPeriodically, we improve and upgrade portions of our IT systems and the functionality of our Internet website in an effort to ensure they meet our evolving business and security needs and are adequate to handle business growth. If we are unable to effectively maintain, operate, secure and timely upgrade our IT systems and our website, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. While we believe that we are diligent in selecting vendors, systems and third party providers to assist us in maintaining the integrity of our IT systems, we realize that there are risks to the systems' integrity and no assurance can be provided that future disruptions, service outages and failures or unauthorized intrusions will not occur. Any failure, interruption or compromise of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and cash flows.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks and may incur additional expenses in order to mitigate such risks or in response to unauthorized access to our data. In addition, an incident in which we or our third-party service providers fail to protect our customers' or employee\u2019s information against a security breach could result in costly government enforcement actions and monetary damages against us from private litigation. Such an incident could otherwise damage our reputation, harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe Company and our third-party service providers, which manage portions of the Company\u2019s data, are subject to cyber security risks. The nature of our business involves the receipt and transmission, and, in some cases, storage by us or third parties on our behalf, of customers\u2019 personal information, shopping preferences and our customers\u2019 credit card information, in addition to employee information and the Company\u2019s financial and operations data. The protection of our customers\u2019 data, as well as confidential Company data is vitally important to the Company. The Company and its third-party service providers employ systems and/or websites that are intended to protect the storage and/or transmission of proprietary or confidential information by us and these third-party service providers. While the Company has implemented measures to prevent and detect security breaches and cyber incidents and to monitor its computer network, any failure of these measures to prevent and detect, and any failure of third parties that assist the Company in managing its data could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nAlthough the Company expects our third-party service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures to protect the proprietary and confidential information once it is received by them, we cannot control these service providers and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future, either at their location or within their systems.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data, disable or degrade storage service, or sabotage systems evolve and change frequently and may be difficult to detect, we and the service providers we use may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures.\nUnauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties acting on our behalf, through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our employees or those of our third-party providers. Despite our preventative efforts and those of our third-party service providers, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, privacy or denial of service attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events which could expose us and our third-party service providers to a risk of loss or misuse of proprietary and confidential information, litigation and potential liability. Cyber security attacks may be targeted at us, our third-party service providers, or our customers. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur significant additional expense, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Any cyber security or security breaches, including any breaches that result in theft, transfer or unauthorized disclosure of customer, employee or company information, or our lack of compliance with information security and privacy laws and regulations, may result in significant legal and financial exposure, including fines and claims for unauthorized purchases with stolen credit card information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims, and considerable other additional expenses. Although we maintain cyber-security insurance there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will cover the particular cyber incident at issue or that such coverage will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be paid to us in a timely manner.\nConsumer awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats is prevalent. Any misappropriation of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered, stored or used by us or our service providers, be it intentional or accidental, could have a material impact on the operation of our business, including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers, employees and investors. Should customers lose confidence in our ability to protect their information, they may discontinue shopping in our stores or on our website which would adversely impact our financial results, cash flow and liquidity.\nOur ability to maintain the value of our trademarks impacts our business and financial performance.\nWe believe that our \u201cchristopher & banks\u201d, \u201ccj banks\u201d and related trademarks are important to our success. Even though we take actions to protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights, we cannot be sure that we will be successful or that others will not imitate or infringe upon our intellectual property rights. In addition, we cannot assure that others will not seek to block the sale of our products by asserting infringement of their trademark and proprietary rights. If we cannot adequately protect our existing and future trademarks or prevent infringement of them, our business and financial performance could suffer.\n3. CAPITAL RISKS\nThe sufficiency and availability of our sources of liquidity may be affected by a variety of factors.\nThe sufficiency and availability of our sources of liquidity may be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation: (i) the level of our operating cash flows, which is impacted by our overall sales and gross margins, general economic conditions and the level of consumer discretionary spending; (ii) our capital expenditures; and (iii) our ability to maintain borrowing availability and to comply with applicable covenants contained in our amended and restated credit agreement (\"the Credit Facility\") and our term loan credit agreement (\u201cthe Term Loan Facility\u201d) with ALCC, LLC as lender.\nOur ability to return to profitability and to generate positive cash flows is dependent upon many factors, including favorable economic conditions and consumer confidence and our ability to successfully execute our financial plan and strategic and tactical initiatives in order to improve overall sales levels and gross margins. There can be no assurance that our cash flows from operations will be sufficient at all times to support our Company without additional financing or credit availability. An inability to generate sufficient cash flows could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit the amount of orders our vendors will produce, or their factors will allow them to produce for us, or result in their imposing unfavorable business terms or possibly refusing to do future business with us;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow money, issue letters of credit under our credit facility, or to invest in our business operations;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to open new stores or improve existing stores; and\n\u2022\nrequire us to incur significant additional indebtedness.\nShould we be unable in the future to borrow under the Credit Facility or the Term Loan Facility, it is possible, depending on the cause of our inability to borrow, that we may not have sufficient cash resources for our operations. If that were to occur, our liquidity would be significantly impaired, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur amended revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement contain various covenants that impose restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our businesses.\nThe amended revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement contain various affirmative and negative covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, have liens on their property, change the nature of their business, issues letters of credits, transact business with affiliates or sell or convey certain of their assets to any one person. In addition, the agreements contain financial covenants that requires the Company to maintain certain financial ratios related to its borrowing base. The ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by our operating results as well as events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could cause our lenders to restrict or eliminate access to funds under the Credit Facility or the Term Loan Facility.\nAccess to additional financing from the capital markets may be limited.\nChanges in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict the Company\u2019s access to potential sources of future liquidity. As a result of general unpredictability in the global financial markets, there can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected or that our capital resources will at all times be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs. Although we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operations, and our availability under our amended revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future, any renewed tightening of the credit or capital markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds, enter into an agreement for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of our securities. Our amended Credit Facility and term loan agreement have covenants and restrictions which, if not met, may limit our ability to access funds.\nWhile we have availability under our Credit Facility and term loan agreement to bolster our liquidity, we may need additional capital to fund our operations, particularly if our cash flows from operating activities were to decrease or if the Credit Facility or Term Loan Facility were unavailable or used to capacity. The sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities in order to improve our liquidity could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. If we borrow under our Credit Facility or incur other debt, our expenses will increase and we could be subject to additional restrictions that may limit our operating flexibility. Newly issued securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior or otherwise superior to those of our common stock. There is no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. Without sufficient liquidity, we will be more vulnerable to any future downturns in our business or the general economy. Future increases in interest rates or other tightening of the credit markets, or future turmoil in the financial markets, could make it more difficult for us to access funds, to refinance our indebtedness (if necessary), to enter into agreements for new indebtedness, or to obtain funding through the issuance of our securities. Also, if we are unable to obtain credit on commercially reasonable terms in the future that could adversely impact our liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which may require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to service debt and limit our financial and operating flexibility in important ways.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Any borrowings under any future debt financing will require interest payments and need to be repaid or refinanced, could require us to divert funds identified for other purposes to debt service and would create additional cash demands and could impair our liquidity position and add financial risk for us. Diverting funds identified for other purposes for debt service may adversely affect our business and growth prospects. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we would be able to take any of these actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us, or at all.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price has experienced volatility over time and this volatility may continue, in part due to factors such as those discussed in this Annual Report's Item 1A. Stock volatility may adversely affect stockholder confidence, as well as associate morale and retention for those associates who receive equity grants as part of their compensation packages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nFuture announcements or disclosure by us or others could affect the market price for our common stock, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour ability to accomplish our strategic and tactical initiatives, and operating goals and to do so in accordance with the timing estimates we have publicly announced;\n\u2022\nthe performance of third-party contract manufacturers, suppliers and service providers;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock or other securities by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates, failure to obtain analyst coverage of our common stock or our failure to achieve our financial guidance;\n\u2022\ndecreases in market valuations of other retailers;\n\u2022\na reverse stock split in connection with seeking to be listed on a national stock exchange; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks that have been unrelated or disproportionate to the individual operating performance of these companies. This volatility could affect the price at which shares of our stock could be sold. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of such company\u2019s securities. Such litigation could result in substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources and have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position, liquidity and cash flows.\n4. LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nIf our long-lived assets become impaired, we may need to record significant non-cash impairment charges.\nPeriodically, we review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If an individual store location is unable to generate sufficient future cash flows, we may be required to record a partial or full impairment of that store\u2019s assets. In addition, significant negative industry or general economic trends, disruptions to our business and unexpected significant changes or planned changes in our use of our assets (such as store relocations or closures) may also result in impairment charges. Any such impairment charges, if significant, could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nLaws on privacy continue to evolve and further limits on how we collect or use customer information could adversely affect our business.\nWe collect and store customer information primarily for marketing to our customers and to improve the services we provide. The use or retention of certain customer information is subject to applicable privacy laws. As privacy, data protection and information security laws and regulations, become more prevalently or restrictive, our compliance costs may increase, particularly in the context of implementing changes to comport with these new laws or regulations, providing adequate data protection and adequate data transfer mechanisms. Individual states are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, data protection and information security laws that could have significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of customer and/or employee information, and some of our current or future business plans. New legislation or regulations, and the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations, could increase our costs of compliance, technology and business operations and could reduce revenues from certain business initiatives. Moreover, the application of new laws or regulations to existing technology and practices can be uncertain and may lead to additional compliance risk and cost.\nIn recent years, there has been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the area of privacy, data protection and information security in the United States. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, ongoing regulatory monitoring, customer attrition, any or all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows. In addition to the extent our or our business partners\u2019 security procedures and protection of customer information prove to be insufficient or inadequate, we may become subject to litigation or other claims, which could expose us to liability and cause damage to our reputation, brand, results of operations, liquidity and cash flow.\nA failure to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent on the use of credit and debit cards to complete sale transactions in our stores and through our website, and because of such use are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (\u201cPCI Standards\u201d). If we or our business partners fail to comply with the PCI Standards or to adequately protect sensitive customer information, we may become subject to fines or limitations on our ability to accept credit or debit cards, which could adversely affect our sales, operating income, brand and reputation. Also, any changes we may be required to make to our private label credit card program in the future could adversely affect the promotional financing arrangements available to our credit card customers and therefore our operating results.\nChanges in accounting rules and regulations could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regards to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change or increase volatility of our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. See Note 1, \u201cNature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements, and \u201cCritical Accounting Policies,\u201d included herein which discusses accounting policies considered to be important to our operational results and financial condition. These and other future changes to accounting rules or regulations could have an adverse impact on our business, operational results, and financial position.\nUnion attempts to organize our employees could negatively affect our business.\nNone of our employees are currently subject to a collective bargaining agreement. It is possible unions may attempt to organize all or part of our employee base at certain stores or within certain regions. Responding to such organization attempts may distract management and employees and may have a negative financial impact on individual stores, or on our business as a whole.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote\nsubstantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"), as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these disclosures and compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations result in increased legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. In addition, if we are successful in becoming re-listed on a national stock exchange, we will be required to spend additional time and effort complying with that exchange's corporate governance requirements.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure. In particular, we are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses.\nWe have incurred and continue to expect to incur significant expense and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with Section 404. Moreover, if we do not comply with the requirements of Section 404 the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would entail expenditure of additional financial and management resources.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover. We are entitled to certain other protective provisions under Delaware law.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third-party to acquire control of the Company, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that some of our stockholders may consider favorable by, among other things:\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nauthorizing the Board to designate and issue \"blank check\" preferred stock;\n\u2022\nlimiting persons who can call special meetings of the Board of Directors or stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at a stockholders' meeting.\nIncreases in labor costs related to changes in employment laws and regulations could impact our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nOur retail store operations are subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working conditions, work scheduling, healthcare reform, paid time off, overtime pay and workers\u2019 compensation.\nA number of factors could adversely affect our operating costs, including additional government-imposed regulations regarding minimum wages, overtime, sick pay, predictive scheduling, paid leaves of absence, mandated health benefits, and changing regulations from the National Labor Relations Board or other agencies. In fact, recent changes in minimum wage laws have resulted in higher starting wage levels at a number of our stores. Complying with new legislation or regulations could be time consuming and expensive and if we are unable to offset increased labor costs through increased sales or improved gross margins, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, operational results, financial position, liquidity and cash flow.\nOur business could be impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others.\nWe may be subject, from time to time, to legal and business challenges in the operation of our Company due to proxy contests, shareholder proposals, media campaigns and other actions instituted by activist shareholders or others. Responding to such actions can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, may not align with our business strategies and could divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of our current or future business strategies. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism or potential changes to the composition of the Board of Directors or senior management may lead to the perception of instability in our business and may also make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified and experienced senior management and Board members.\nWe may be subject to adverse outcomes in current or future litigation matters or regulatory proceedings which could result in the unexpected expenditure of time and resources.\nFrom time-to-time, we may be involved in litigation, regulatory actions and other claims against our business. For example, in August of 2019, a stockholder, following a books and record demand, filed a purported class action in Delaware Chancery court contending that former and current directors of the Company breached their fiduciary duty by rejecting an offer to purchase the Company at $.80 per share. The Complaint also alleges that B. Riley, the Company's financial advisor, aided and abetted the board's alleged breach. The individual Defendants and B. Riley each filed a motion to dismiss; the motion has been fully briefed oral arguments before the Court held on February 13, 2020.\nThere are also other types of claims that could be asserted against us based on litigation that has been asserted against others, particularly in the retail industry such as intellectual property infringement (as discussed below) customer and employment claims, actions against directors or officers, including class action claims or lawsuits alleging violations of federal or state laws. These matters could raise complex factual and legal issues requiring significant management time and, if determined to be adverse to the Company, could subject the Company to material liabilities.\nIn recent years, there has been increasing activity by companies which have acquired intellectual property rights, but do not practice those rights (sometimes referred to as \u201cpatent trolls\u201d), to engage in very broad licensing programs aimed at a large number of companies in a wide variety of businesses, or at retail companies specifically. These efforts typically involve proposing licenses in exchange for a payment of money and may also include the threat or actual initiation of litigation. Any such litigation can be costly to defend, even if the claims are unsubstantiated or ultimately to be found without merit. It is not possible to predict the impact, if any, of such claims on our business and operations.\nAn unfavorable outcome in any such litigation, claims or regulatory proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and/or our reputation. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings can be expensive and require that we devote substantial resources and executive time to them, thereby diverting management\u2019s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.", "PERMNO": 77478, "SIC": 5621, "TIC": "CBKC"}
