{"cik": "6955", "company": "ACTUANT CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-10-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing the Company. If any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may adversely impact our business.\nDeterioration of, or instability in, the domestic and international economy and challenging end market conditions could impact our ability to grow the business and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur businesses and operating results have been, and will continue to be, affected by domestic and international economic conditions. The level of demand for our products depends, in part, on general economic conditions in our served end markets. A substantial portion of our revenues are derived from customers in cyclical industries (industrial and oil & gas) that typically are adversely affected by downward economic cycles. As global economic uncertainty continues, our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, which may delay or lengthen sales cycles. Beginning in fiscal 2016, we experienced challenging and inconsistent demand in several of our served markets, including oil & gas and infrastructure markets. As a result of these and other factors, we implemented various restructuring initiatives aimed at reducing our cost structure and improving operational performance. While we have seen recovery in those end markets, we are still executing on restructuring initiatives previously announced. Further, we may implement additional restructuring initiatives in response to further market challenges to achieve additional efficiencies. Such initiatives could result in restructuring costs, including facility consolidations, workforce reductions and structural realignment. Although we expect that the related cost savings and realization of efficiencies will offset the restructuring related costs over time, we may not achieve the desired net benefits of these efforts (see Note 3, \"Restructuring Charges\" and \"Business Update\" within Item 7 for further discussion of our restructuring activities and future anticipated cost savings).\nIf we fail to develop new products, or customers do not accept our new products, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to develop innovative new products can affect our competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. Difficulties or delays in research, development, production or commercialization of new products, or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies, may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position. Operational excellence processes including effective product sourcing, lean manufacturing, acquisition integration and leadership development, along with other continuous improvement activities, are utilized to improve our businesses. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. If we fail to make innovations, launch products with quality problems, experience development cost overruns, or the market does not accept our new products, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nDivestitures and discontinued operations could negatively impact our business, and retained liabilities from businesses that we sell could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn connection with the execution of our strategy to become a pure-play industrial tools and services company, we have or are in the process of executing several divestitures, including the anticipated divestiture of the remaining businesses within the EC&S segment by the end of calendar 2019. These divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business, including required separation or carve-out activities and costs, disputes with buyers or potential impairment charges.\nAfter reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, we are also subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, as well as necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms, which may prevent us from completing a transaction. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement, as we may be required to retain responsibility for, or agree to indemnify buyers against contingent liabilities related to businesses sold, such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, lease payments, product liability claims or environmental matters. Under these types of arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect future financial results. Further, with respect to the EC&S divestiture, we are required to perform certain transition services which, based on the uncertainty of the time period for which we will perform them, may inhibit our ability to timely execute the necessary actions to reduce our corporate cost structure to a level appropriate to the size of our remaining operations.\nIf we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue and profits associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate them.\nA significant portion of our growth has come from strategic acquisitions of businesses. We plan to continue making acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our industrial tools product offerings. Our ability to successfully execute acquisitions will be impacted by a number of factors, including the availability of financing on terms acceptable to us, our ability to identify acquisition candidates that meet our valuation parameters and increased competition for acquisitions. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations also may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Although we expect to successfully integrate any acquired businesses, we may not achieve the desired net benefit in the time-frame planned. Failure to effectively execute our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate the acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe may not be able to realize planned benefits from acquired companies.\nWe may not be able to realize planned benefits from acquired companies. Achieving those benefits depends on the timely, efficient and successful execution of a number of post-acquisition events, including integrating the acquired business into the Company. Factors that could affect our ability to achieve these benefits include:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating and managing personnel, financial reporting and other systems used by the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nthe failure of acquired businesses to perform in accordance with our expectations;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve anticipated synergies between our business units and the business units of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nthe loss of customers of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key managers of acquired businesses; or\n\u2022\nother material adverse events in the acquired businesses.\nIf acquired businesses do not operate as we anticipate, it could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, acquired businesses may operate in niche markets in which we have little or no experience. In such instances, we will be highly dependent on existing managers and employees to manage those businesses, and the loss of any key managers or employees of the acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nThe indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements may result in unexpected liabilities.\nCertain acquisition agreements from past and current acquisitions require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of each of their companies. In most of these agreements, the liability of the former owners is limited to specific warranties given in the agreement, as well as, in amount and duration and certain former owners may not be able to meet their indemnification responsibilities. These indemnification provisions may not fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position.\nOur goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount of our total assets.\nOur total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At August 31, 2019, goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $313 million, or 28% of our total assets. The goodwill results from acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. We assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall below current levels, we could be required to recognize a non-cash charge to operating earnings to impair the related goodwill or other intangible assets. With respect to continuing operations, we recognized $22 million in non-cash impairment charges in fiscal 2019 related to the goodwill and intangible assets of several of our businesses (see Note 6, \"Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\" and \"Critical Accounting Policies\" for further discussion on goodwill, intangible asset and long-lived asset impairments). Any future goodwill or intangible asset impairments could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertainty over global tariffs, or the financial impact of tariffs, may negatively affect our results.\nChanges in U.S. domestic and global tariff frameworks have increased our costs of producing goods and resulted in additional risks to our supply chain. More tariff changes also are possible. We have developed and implemented strategies thus far to mitigate previously implemented and, in some cases, proposed tariff increases, but there is no assurance we will be able to continue to mitigate prolonged tariffs. Further, uncertainties about future tariff changes could result in mitigation actions that prove to be detrimental to our business.\nOur indebtedness could harm our operating flexibility and competitive position.\nWe have incurred, and may in the future incur, significant indebtedness in connection with acquisitions or other strategic growth initiatives. We have, and will continue to have, a substantial amount of debt which requires interest and principal payments. Our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could adversely affect our operating flexibility and put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur ability to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance our indebtedness and satisfy our other debt and lease obligations will depend upon our future operating performance and credit market conditions, which could be adversely affected by factors beyond our control. In addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financings will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nThe financial and other covenants in our debt agreements may adversely affect us.\nOur senior credit agreement and our other debt agreement contain financial and other restrictive covenants. These covenants could adversely affect us by limiting our financial and operating flexibility as well as our ability to plan for and react to market conditions and to meet our capital needs. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in events of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay indebtedness before its due date and we may not have the financial resources or be able to arrange alternative financing to do so. Borrowings under our senior credit facility are secured by most domestic personal property assets and are guaranteed by most of our domestic subsidiaries and by a pledge of the stock of most of our domestic and certain foreign subsidiaries. If borrowings under our senior credit facility were declared or became due and payable immediately as the result of an event of default and we were unable to repay or refinance those borrowings, the lenders could foreclose on the pledged assets and stock. Any event that requires us to repay any of our debt before it is due could require us to borrow additional amounts at unfavorable borrowing terms, cause a significant reduction in our liquidity and impair our ability to pay amounts due on our indebtedness. Moreover, if we are required to repay any of our debt before it becomes due, we may be unable to borrow additional amounts or otherwise obtain the cash necessary to repay that debt, when due, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur businesses operate in highly competitive markets, so we may be forced to cut prices or incur additional costs.\nOur businesses generally face substantial competition, domestically and internationally, in each of their respective markets. We may lose market share in certain businesses or be forced to reduce prices or incur increased costs to maintain existing business. We compete globally on the basis of product design, quality, availability, performance and customer service. Present or future competitors in our markets may have greater financial, technical or other resources which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, some of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower margins in order to compete with us.\nOur international operations pose currency and other risks.\nWe continue to focus on penetrating global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from and into foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue. Approximately 60% of our net sales from continuing operations in fiscal 2019 were outside the United States. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the United States. Our international operations present special risks, primarily from currency exchange rate fluctuations, exposure to local economic and political conditions, export and import restrictions and controls on repatriation of cash. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates will continue to add volatility as over one-third of our sales from continuing operations are generated outside of the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, United States tax reform has significantly changed how foreign operations are taxed in the United States. Therefore we continue to review how to transform our organizational structure in response. We earn a substantial portion of our income from international operations and therefore changes to where income is generated may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations. To the extent that we expand our international presence, these risks may increase.\nGeopolitical unrest and terrorist activities may cause the economic conditions in the U.S. or abroad to deteriorate, which could harm our business.\nTerrorist attacks against targets in the U.S. or abroad, rumors or threats of war, other geopolitical activity or trade disruptions may cause general economic conditions in the U.S. or abroad to deteriorate. The occurrence of any of these events could result in a prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the U.S. or in other areas and could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur significant reliance on third-party suppliers for components for the manufacture, assembly and sale of our products involves risks.\nWe rely on suppliers to secure component products and finished goods required for the manufacture and assembly of our products. A disruption in deliveries to or from key suppliers, or decreased availability of components or commodities, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. Further, poor supplier quality or an insecure supply chain could adversely affect the reliability, performance and reputation of our products. Additionally, if demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer. Our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations, if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis.\nA material disruption at a significant manufacturing facility could adversely affect our ability to generate sales and result in increased costs that we cannot recover.\nOur financial performance could be adversely affected as a result of our inability to meet customer demand for our products in the event of a material disruption at one of our significant manufacturing facilities. Equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, adverse weather conditions, labor disputes or other influences could create a material disruption. Interruptions to production could increase our cost of sales, harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain our customers. Our business continuity plans may not be sufficient to address disruptions attributable to such risks. Any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nLarge or rapid increases in the costs of commodities and raw materials, including impact of tariffs, or substantial decreases in their availability could adversely affect our operations.\nThe primary raw materials that are used in our products include steel, plastic resin, brass, steel wire and rubber. Most of our suppliers are not currently parties to long-term contracts with us. Consequently, we are vulnerable to fluctuations in prices of such raw materials, including the impact of tariffs. Factors such as supply and demand, freight costs and transportation availability, inventory levels, the level of imports and general economic conditions may affect the prices of raw materials that we need. If we experience a significant increase in raw material prices, or if we are unable to pass along increases in raw material prices to our customers, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, an increasing portion of our products are sourced from low-cost regions. Changes in export regulations, taxes, tariffs and disruptions in transportation routes from regions that we source commodities and raw materials could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that may change in ways that are detrimental to our competitiveness or results.\nOur businesses are subject to regulation under a broad range of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations. There is no assurance that such laws, regulations and policies will not be changed in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our results by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright. Particular legislative, regulatory or other areas that may have an effect on our structure, operations, markets, sales, liquidity, tax rate or the results of our businesses include export and import controls, anti-corruption law, competition law, data privacy regulations, currency controls and economic or political sanctions.\nCosts and liabilities arising from legal proceedings could be material and adversely impact our financial results.\nWe are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings. We maintain insurance and have established reserves for these matters as appropriate and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and practices. Insurance coverage, to the extent it is available, may not cover all losses arising from such contingencies. Also, estimating legal reserves or possible losses involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation and investigations and the actual losses arising from particular matters may exceed our current estimates and adversely affect our results of operations. We also expect that additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time, and we cannot predict the magnitude and outcome of such additional matters. Moreover, we operate in jurisdictions where claims involving us may be adjudicated within legal systems that are less developed and less reliable than those of the U.S. or other more developed markets, and this can create additional uncertainty about the outcome of proceedings before courts or other governmental bodies in such markets.\nLegal compliance risks could result in significant costs to our business or cause us to restrict current activities or curtail growth plans.\nWe and our representatives operate in industries, markets and jurisdictions in which we are exposed to inherent compliance risks and that are subject to significant scrutiny by regulators, governmental authorities and other persons. We continue to strengthen our risk management and compliance programs to mitigate such risks and operate in compliance with applicable laws, but the global and diverse nature of our operations, the complex and high-risk nature of some of our markets and the current enforcement environment mean that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist throughout our operations. The consequences of compliance risks could include enforcement actions or private litigation resulting in significant defense and investigation costs, fines and penalties, and a broad range of remedial actions, including potential restrictions on our operations and other adverse changes to our business plans. See Note 16, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about compliance risks.\nHealth, Safety and Environmental laws and regulations may result in additional costs.\nWe are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing public and worker health and safety. Violations of these laws could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities that could harm our operating results. Pursuant to such laws, governmental authorities have required us to contribute to the cost of investigating or remediating certain matters at current or previously owned and operated sites. In addition, we provided environmental indemnities in connection with the sale of certain businesses and product lines. Liability as an owner or operator, or as an arranger for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances, can be joint and several and can be imposed without regard to fault. There is a risk that costs relating to these matters could be greater than what we currently expect or exceed our insurance coverage, or that additional remediation and compliance obligations could arise which require us to make material expenditures. In particular, more stringent environmental laws, unanticipated remediation requirements or the discovery of previously unknown conditions could materially harm our financial condition and operating results. We are also required to comply with various environmental laws and maintain permits, some of which are subject to discretionary renewal from time to time, for many of our businesses, and our business operations could be restricted if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that we may require.\nOur inability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nOur ability to deliver financial results and drive growth and pursue competitive advantages in our business substantially depends on our ability to retain key employees and continually attract new talent to the business. If we experience losses of key employees, such as our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or experience significant delays or difficulty in replacing them, our operations, competitive positions and financial results may be adversely affected. Competition for highly qualified personnel is intense and our competitors and others can be expected to attempt to hire our skilled employees from time to time. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience to operate our businesses successfully. From time to time there may be shortages of skilled labor which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain qualified employees or lead to increased labor costs.\nCyber security vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and data.\nIncreased global cyber security vulnerabilities, threats, computer viruses and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks, as well as cyber security failures resulting from human error and technological errors, pose a risk to our systems, products and data as well as potentially to our employees\u2019, customers', partners', suppliers' and third-party service providers' data. An attack could result in security breaches, theft, lost or corrupted data, misappropriation of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, loss of trade secrets and commercially valuable information, production downtimes and operational disruptions. We attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, monitoring and testing, and maintenance of protective systems and contingency plans, but we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. There is no assurance the financial or operational impact from such threats will not be material.\nOur intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitors from developing products and services similar to or duplicative to ours, and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted by external dependencies.\nOur patents, trademarks and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling products and services similar to or duplicative of ours or that our intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of our innovations and technology. In addition, further steps we take to protect our intellectual property, including non-disclosure agreements, may not prevent the misappropriation of our business critical secrets and information. In such circumstances, our competitive position and the value of our brand may be negatively impacted.\nOur competitors or other persons could assert that we have infringed their intellectual property rights.\nWe may be the target of enforcement of patents or other intellectual property rights by third parties. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time consuming. If we are found to infringe any third-party rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or we could be enjoined from offering some of our current products and services.\nOur customers and other business partners often require terms and conditions that expose us to significant risks and liabilities.\nWe operate in end-markets and industries in which our customers and business partners seek to contractually shift significant risks associated with their operations or projects to us. We continue to review and improve our commercial and contracting practices to manage the risks we are assuming, but we cannot assure that material liabilities will not arise from our contracts with our business partners. Also, as we impose more stringent contracting standards on our operations, we may experience market share losses or the reduction in growth opportunities.", "PERMNO": 11581, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "EPAC"}
