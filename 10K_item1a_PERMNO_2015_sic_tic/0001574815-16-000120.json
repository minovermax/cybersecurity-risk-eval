{"cik": "1574815", "company": "BMC STOCK HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe industry in which we operate is dependent upon the homebuilding industry and repair and remodeling activity, the economy, the credit markets and other important factors.\nThe building products supply and services industry is highly dependent on new home construction and repair and remodeling activity, which in turn are dependent upon a number of factors, including interest rates, consumer confidence, employment rates, wage rates, foreclosure rates, housing inventory levels, housing demand, the availability of land, local zoning and permitting processes, the availability of construction financing and the health of the economy and mortgage markets. Unfavorable changes in demographics, credit markets, consumer confidence, health care costs, housing affordability, housing inventory levels, a weakening of the national economy or of any regional or local economy in which we operate and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect consumer spending, result in decreased demand for homes and adversely affect our business.\nThe homebuilding industry underwent a significant downturn that began in mid-2006 and began to stabilize in late 2011. The downturn in the homebuilding industry resulted in a substantial reduction in demand for our products and services, which in turn had a significant adverse effect on our business during fiscal years 2007 through 2012. The U.S. Census Bureau reported approximately 715,000 single-family housing starts for 2015, which is an increase of approximately 10% from 2014, but still well below historical averages over the past 50 years. There is significant uncertainty regarding the timing and extent of any recovery in construction and repair and remodeling activity and resulting product demand levels. The positive impact of a recovery on our business may also be dampened to the extent the average selling price or average size of new single family homes decreases, which could cause homebuilders to decrease spending on our products and services.\nIn addition, beginning in 2007, the mortgage markets experienced substantial disruption due to increased defaults, primarily as a result of credit quality deterioration. The disruption resulted in a stricter regulatory environment and reduced availability of mortgages for potential home buyers due to a tight credit market and stricter standards to qualify for mortgages. Mortgage financing and commercial credit for smaller homebuilders, as well as for the development of new residential lots, continue to be constrained. As the housing industry is dependent upon the economy as well as potential homebuyers\u2019 access to mortgage financing and homebuilders\u2019 access to commercial credit, it is likely that the housing industry will not fully recover until conditions in the economy and the credit markets improve. Prolonged weakness in the homebuilding industry would have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs a result of the homebuilding industry downturn, there has been a trend of significant consolidation as smaller, private homebuilders have gone out of business. We refer to the large homebuilders as \u201cproduction homebuilders.\u201d While we generate significant business from these homebuilders, our gross margins on sales to them tend to be lower than our gross margins on sales to other market segments. This could impact our gross margins as homebuilding recovers if the market share held by the production homebuilders increases.\nChanges in federal income tax laws may also affect demand for new homes. Various proposals have been publicly discussed to limit mortgage interest deductions and to limit the exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence. Enactment of such proposals may have an adverse effect on the homebuilding industry in general. No meaningful prediction can be made as to whether any such proposals will be enacted and, if enacted, the particular form such laws would take. Because we have substantial fixed costs, relatively modest declines in our customers\u2019 production levels could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe building products supply and services industry is seasonal and cyclical.\nOur industry is seasonal. Although weather patterns affect our operating results throughout the year, our first and fourth quarters have historically been, and are generally expected to continue to be, adversely affected by weather patterns in some of our markets, causing reduced construction activity. To the extent that hurricanes, severe storms, earthquakes, floods, fires, droughts, other natural disasters or similar events occur in the markets in which we operate, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe building products supply and services industry is also subject to cyclical market pressures. Quarterly results historically have reflected, and are expected to continue to reflect, fluctuations from period to period arising from the following: the volatility of lumber prices; the cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry; general economic conditions in the markets in which we compete; the pricing policies of our competitors and the production schedules of our customers.\nOur industry is highly fragmented and competitive, and increased competitive pressure may adversely affect our results.\nThe building products supply and services industry is highly fragmented and competitive. We face significant competition from local, regional and national building materials chains, as well as from privately-owned single site enterprises. Any of these competitors may (i) foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do, (ii) provide superior service and sell superior products, (iii) have the ability to produce or supply similar products and services at a lower cost, (iv) develop stronger relationships with our customers, (v) adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements than we do, (vi) develop a superior branch network in our markets or (vii) have access to financing on more favorable terms that we can obtain. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully with them. In addition, home center retailers, which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and small contractors, may in the future intensify their marketing efforts to professional homebuilders. Furthermore, certain product manufacturers sell and distribute their products directly to production homebuilders. The volume of such direct sales could increase in the future. Additionally, manufacturers and specialty distributors who sell products to us may elect to sell and distribute directly to homebuilders in the future or enter into exclusive supplier arrangements with other distributors. Consolidation of production homebuilders may result in increased competition for their business. Finally, we may not be able to maintain our operating costs or product prices at a level sufficiently low for us to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete effectively, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nCertain of our products are commodities and fluctuations in prices of these commodities could affect our operating results.\nMany of the building products we distribute, including OSB, plywood, lumber and particleboard, are commodities that are widely available from other manufacturers or distributors with prices and volumes determined frequently based on participants\u2019 perceptions of short-term supply and demand factors. A shortage of capacity or excess capacity in the industry can result in significant increases or declines in market prices for those products, often within a short period of time.\nPrices of commodity products can also change as a result of national and international economic conditions, labor and freight costs, competition, market speculation, government regulation and trade policies, as well as from periodic delays in the delivery of lumber and other products. Short-term changes in the cost of these materials, some of which are subject to significant fluctuations, are sometimes passed on to our customers but our pricing quotation periods and pricing pressure from our competitors may limit our ability to pass on such price changes. For example, we frequently enter into extended pricing commitments, which may compress our gross margins in periods of inflation. At times, the price at which we can charge our customers for any one or more products may even fall below the price at which we can purchase such products, requiring us to incur short-term losses on product sales. We may also be limited in our ability to pass on increases in freight costs on our products due to the price of fuel.\nPeriods of generally increasing prices provide the opportunity for higher sales and increased gross profit (subject to the extended pricing commitments described above), while generally declining price environments may result in declines in sales and profitability. In particular, low market prices for wood products over a sustained period can adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows, as can excessive spikes in market prices. While we experienced increasing prices from 2011 to 2013 as the homebuilding market recovered, prices have generally decreased for the last two years. For the year ended December 31, 2015, average composite framing lumber prices and average composite structural panel prices (a composite calculation based on index prices for OSB and plywood) as reported by Random Lengths were 14% and 5% lower, respectively, than the prior year. Our lumber & lumber sheet goods product category represented approximately 29% of net sales in 2015. If lumber or structural panel prices were to decline significantly from current levels, our sales and profits would be negatively affected.\nWe are exposed to product liability, warranty, casualty, construction defect, contract, tort, employment and other claims and legal proceedings related to our business, products and services as well as services provided for us through third parties.\nWe are from time to time involved in product liability, warranty, casualty, construction defect, contract, tort, employment and other claims relating to our business, the products we manufacture, distribute or install, and services we provide, either directly or through third parties, that, if adversely determined, could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows if we were unable to seek indemnification for such claims or were not adequately insured for such claims. We rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with many of the products we sell, distribute or install. Because we do not have direct control over the quality of such products manufactured or supplied by such third-party suppliers, we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products. In addition, we are exposed to potential claims arising from the conduct of our employees, homebuilders and their subcontractors, and third-party installers for which we may be liable. We and they are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of our third-party installers. If we fail to manage these processes effectively or provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business.\nAlthough we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate insurance in excess of our self-insured amounts, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. Product liability, warranty, casualty, construction defect, contract, tort, employment and other claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in our products and our Company. We cannot assure you that any current or future claims will not adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to achieve profitability or maintain positive cash flows from operations.\nWe have set goals to achieve and progressively improve our profitability over time by growing our sales, increasing our gross margin and reducing our expenses as a percentage of sales. For the fiscal year ended 2015 we had a net loss of $4.8 million, which included $23.0 million of Merger-related costs, and cash provided by operations of $0.7 million. For the fiscal year ended 2014 we had net income of $94.0 million, which included a $76.1 million gain related to the reversal of tax valuation allowances, and cash provided by operations of $30.7 million. There can be no assurance that we will achieve our profitability goals or continue to generate positive cash flow from operations. Factors that could significantly adversely affect our efforts to achieve these goals include, but are not limited to, the failure to:\n\u2022\nintegrate BMC into the Company successfully (see \u201cRisks Related to the Merger with Building Materials Holding Corporation\u201d below for risk factors related to the Merger;\n\u2022\ngrow our revenue through organic growth or through acquisitions;\n\u2022\nimprove our revenue mix by investing (including through acquisitions) in businesses that provide higher gross margins than we have been able to generate historically;\n\u2022\nachieve improvements in purchasing or maintain or increase our rebates from suppliers through our supplier consolidation and/or low-cost country initiatives;\n\u2022\nimprove our gross margins through the utilization of improved pricing practices and technology and sourcing savings;\n\u2022\nmaintain or reduce our overhead and support expenses as we grow;\n\u2022\neffectively evaluate future inventory reserves;\n\u2022\ncollect monies owed from customers;\n\u2022\nmaintain relationships with our significant customers; and\n\u2022\nintegrate any businesses acquired.\nAny of these failures or delays may adversely affect our ability to increase our profitability.\nHomebuilding activities in Texas, California and Georgia have a large impact on our results of operations because we conduct a significant portion of our business in markets within these states.\nWe presently conduct a significant portion of our business in Texas, California and Georgia, which represented approximately 34%, 13% and 13%, respectively, of 2015 total net sales on a pro forma basis, including pre-acquisition sales of Legacy SBS, VNS and RBI. Home prices and sales activities in these markets and in most of the other markets in which we operate have declined from time to time, particularly as a result of slow economic growth. In the last several years, many of these markets have benefited from better than average employment growth, which has aided homebuilding activities, but we cannot assure you that these conditions will continue. Local economic conditions can depend on a variety of factors, including national economic conditions, local and state budget situations and the impact of cutbacks in federal spending and employment. In addition, the recent significant decline in oil prices may negatively impact home construction and remodeling activity in Texas (particularly the Houston metropolitan area which accounted for 15% of our 2015 total net sales on a pro forma basis, including pre-acquisition sales of Legacy SBS, VNS and RBI) and other markets with significant employment in the energy sector. Such a reduction in construction and remodeling activities could negatively impact our operating results in those markets in the future. If homebuilding activity declines in one or more of the markets in which we operate, our costs may not decline at all or at the same rate and therefore may negatively impact our operating results.\nBecause our operations are currently concentrated in these areas, a prolonged economic downturn in the future in one or more of these areas or a particular industry that is fundamental to one of these areas, particularly within Texas, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, and a disproportionately greater impact on us than other lumber and building material companies with more diversified operations. To the extent the oil and gas industries, which can be very volatile, are negatively impacted by declining commodity prices, climate change, legislation or other factors,\na result could be a reduction in employment, or other negative economic consequences, which in turn could adversely impact home sales and activities in Texas and certain of our other markets.\nOur continued success will depend on our ability to retain our key employees and to attract and retain new qualified employees, while controlling our labor costs.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain qualified managerial, operational, sales and other personnel, while at the same time controlling our labor costs. We face significant competition for these types of employees in our industry and from other industries. Labor shortages may impact our ability to hire skilled or unskilled workers with experience in carpentry, construction or fabrication. We may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to conduct and expand our operations successfully. In addition, key personnel, including sales force employees with key customer relationships, may leave us and compete against us. Our success also depends to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior management team. Our officers and divisional vice presidents have over 200 years of combined experience in manufacturing, distribution, retail and homebuilding, and have been integral to our successful acquisition and integration of businesses to gain scale in our current markets. The loss of any member of our senior management team or other experienced, senior employees or sales force employees could impair our ability to execute our business plan, cause us to lose customers and reduce our net sales, or lead to employee morale problems and/or the loss of other key employees. In any such event, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates, the impact of legislation or regulations governing wages, regulations governing payment of workers on a \"piece-work\" or \"piece-rate\" basis (i.e., by measurable work completed) instead of by the hour, labor relations, healthcare benefits, and health and other insurance costs. In addition, we compete with other companies for many of our employees in hourly and piece-rate positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs. If we are unable to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, it could adversely impact our operating results.\nMoreover, our employees may experience uncertainty about their future role with the Company in light of the recent Merger until, or even after, strategies with regard to the Company are announced or executed. These factors may adversely affect our ability to retain, motivate and recruit executives and other key employees and keep them focused on applicable strategies and goals. Our failure to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees during the post-Merger integration period could have a negative impact on our business.\nProduct shortages, loss of key suppliers or failure to develop relationships with qualified suppliers, and our dependence on third-party suppliers and manufacturers could affect our financial health.\nOur ability to offer a wide variety of products to our customers is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate product supply from manufacturers and other suppliers. Generally, our products are obtainable from various sources and in sufficient quantities. Our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. Our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by the financial instability of suppliers (particularly in light of continuing economic difficulties in various regions of the United States and the world), suppliers\u2019 noncompliance with applicable laws, supply disruptions, shipping interruptions or costs, and other factors beyond our control. The loss of, or a substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements could adversely impact our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nAlthough in many instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by either party on limited notice. Many of our suppliers also offer us favorable terms based on the volume of our purchases. If market conditions change, suppliers may stop offering us favorable terms. Failure by our suppliers to continue to supply us with products on favorable terms, commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could put pressure on our operating margins or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nA portion of the workforces of many of our suppliers, particularly our foreign suppliers, are represented by labor unions. Workforce disputes at these suppliers may result in work stoppages or slowdowns. Such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on these suppliers ability to continue meeting our needs.\nThe implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail.\nWe have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and technology. These initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our employees to continue to provide high quality service to our customers, while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected purchasing experience. The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. In the event that we grow very rapidly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to keep up, expand or adapt our IT infrastructure to meet evolving demand on a timely basis and at a commercially reasonable cost, or at all. In addition, our improved supply chain and new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether.\nWe occupy most of our facilities under long-term non-cancellable leases. We may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms. If we close a facility, we are still obligated under the applicable lease.\nMost of our facilities are located in leased premises. Many of our current leases are non-cancellable and typically have initial terms ranging from five to ten years and most provide options to renew for specified periods of time. We believe that leases we enter into in the future will likely be long-term and non-cancellable and have similar renewal options. If we close or idle a facility, most likely we remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, which would include, among other things, payment of the base rent, insurance, taxes and other expenses on the leased property for the balance of the lease term. The inability to terminate leases when idling a facility or exiting a geographic market can have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIn addition, at the end of the lease term and any renewal period for a facility, we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost, if at all. If we are unable to renew our facility leases, we may close or relocate a facility, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, we may not be able to secure a replacement facility in a location that is as commercially viable, including access to rail service, as the lease we are unable to renew. For example, closing a facility, even during the time of relocation, will reduce the sales that the facility would have contributed to our revenues. Additionally, the revenue and profit, if any, generated at a relocated facility may not equal the revenue and profit generated at the existing one.\nWe may be unable to effectively manage our inventory and working capital as our sales volume increases or material prices fluctuate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe purchase certain materials, including lumber products, which are then sold to customers as well as used as direct production inputs for our manufactured and prefabricated products. We must maintain, and have adequate working capital to purchase, sufficient inventory to meet customer demand. Due to the lead times required by our suppliers, we order products in advance of expected sales. This requires us to forecast our sales and purchase accordingly. In periods of growth, it can be especially difficult to forecast sales accurately. We must also manage our working capital to fund our inventory purchases. Excessive spikes in the market prices of certain building products, such as lumber, can put negative pressure on our operating cash flows by requiring us to invest more in inventory. In the future, if we are unable to manage effectively our inventory and working capital as we attempt to grow our business, our cash flows may be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe majority of our net sales are credit sales that are made primarily to customers whose ability to pay is dependent, in part, upon the economic strength of the industry and geographic areas in which they operate, and the failure to collect or timely collect monies owed from customers could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe majority of our net sales volume in fiscal 2015 was facilitated through the extension of credit to our customers whose ability to pay is dependent, in part, upon the economic strength of the industry in the areas where they operate. We offer credit to customers, either through unsecured credit that is based solely upon the creditworthiness of the customer, or secured credit for materials sold for a specific job where the security lies in lien rights associated with the material going into the job. The type of credit offered depends both on the financial strength of the customer and the nature of the business in which the customer is involved. End users, resellers and other non-contractor customers generally purchase more on unsecured credit than secured credit. The inability of our customers to pay off their credit lines in a timely manner, or at all, would adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Furthermore, our collections efforts with respect to non-paying or slow-paying customers could negatively impact our customer relations going forward.\nBecause we depend on the creditworthiness of certain of our customers, if the financial condition of our customers declines, our credit risk could increase. Significant contraction in our markets, coupled with tightened credit availability and financial institution underwriting standards, could adversely affect certain of our customers. Should one or more of our larger customers declare bankruptcy as has occurred in the past, it could adversely affect the collectability of our accounts receivable, bad debt reserves and net income.\nWe are subject to competitive pricing pressure from our customers.\nProduction homebuilders historically have exerted significant pressure on their outside suppliers to keep prices low because of their market share and ability to leverage such market share in the highly fragmented building products supply and services industry. The housing industry downturn resulted in significantly increased pricing pressures from production homebuilders and other customers. These pricing pressures have adversely affected our operating results and cash flows. In addition, continued consolidation among homebuilders, and changes in homebuilders\u2019 purchasing policies or payment practices, could result in additional pricing pressure. Moreover, during the housing downturn, several of our homebuilder customers defaulted on amounts owed to us or extended their payable days as a result of their financial condition. If such payment failures or delays were to recur, it could significantly adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share.\nIt is difficult to predict successfully the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to changes in demographics, consumer preferences, expectations, needs and weather conditions, while also managing inventory levels. For example, an increased consumer focus on making homes energy efficient could require us to offer more energy efficient building materials and there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify appropriate suppliers on acceptable terms. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and building product needs could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, which includes pursuing strategic acquisitions and opening new facilities.\nOur long-term business plan provides for continued growth through strategic acquisitions and organic growth through the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities. Failure to identify and acquire suitable acquisition candidates on appropriate terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy. Moreover, our reduced operating results during the housing downturn, our liquidity position or the requirements of our Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Capital Finance (the \"Credit Agreement\") could prevent us from obtaining the capital required to effect new acquisitions or expansions of existing facilities. Our failure to make successful acquisitions or to build or expand facilities, including manufacturing facilities, produce saleable product or meet customer demand in a timely manner could result in damage to or loss of customer relationships, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nFederal, state, local and other regulations could impose substantial costs and/or restrictions on our operations that would reduce our net income.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and other regulations, including, among other things, regulations promulgated by the DOT, work safety regulations promulgated by OSHA, employment regulations promulgated by the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, regulations of the United States Department of Labor, federal and state environmental regulations, accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or similar entities, and state and local zoning restrictions, building codes and contractors\u2019 licensing regulations. More burdensome regulatory requirements in these or other areas may increase our general and administrative costs and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Moreover, failure to comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to our business could expose us to litigation and/or substantial penalties that could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur transportation operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the DOT. The DOT has broad administrative powers with respect to our transportation operations. More restrictive limitations on vehicle weight and size, trailer length and configuration, or driver hours of service would increase our costs, which, if we are unable to pass these cost increases on to our customers, may increase our selling, general and administrative expenses and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash\nflows. If we fail to comply adequately with DOT regulations or regulations become more stringent, we could experience increased inspections, regulatory authorities could take remedial action including imposing fines or shutting down our operations or we could be subject to increased audit and compliance costs. If any of these events were to occur, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the homebuilding industry is subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, codes, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design and safety, construction, energy conservation, environmental protection and similar matters, including regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements on our business or that limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Regulatory restrictions may increase our operating expenses and limit the availability of suitable building lots for our customers, which could negatively affect our sales and earnings.\nThe loss of any of our significant customers could affect our financial health.\nOur ten largest customers generated approximately 20.0% and 22.2% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We cannot guarantee that we will maintain or improve our relationships with these customers or that we will continue to supply these customers at historical levels. Due to the weak housing market over the past several years in comparison to long-term averages, many of our homebuilder customers substantially reduced their construction activity. Some homebuilder customers exited or severely curtailed building activity in certain of our markets.\nIn addition, production homebuilders and other customers may: (i) seek to purchase some of the products that we currently sell directly from manufacturers; (ii) elect to establish their own building products manufacturing and distribution facilities or (iii) give advantages to manufacturing or distribution intermediaries in which they have an economic stake. Continued consolidation among production homebuilders could also result in a loss of some of our present customers to our competitors. The loss of one or more of our significant customers or deterioration in our relations with any of them could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Furthermore, our customers typically are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us. The contracts into which we have entered with most of our professional customers typically provide that we supply particular products or services for a certain period of time when and if ordered by the customer. Should our customers purchase our products in significantly lower quantities than they have in the past, such decreased purchases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe may be adversely affected by any natural or man-made disruptions to our distribution and manufacturing facilities.\nWe currently maintain a broad network of distribution and manufacturing facilities throughout the eastern, southern and western United States. Any widespread disruption to our facilities resulting from fire, earthquake, weather-related events, an act of terrorism or any other cause could damage a significant portion of our inventory and could materially impair our ability to distribute our products to customers. We could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers during the time that it takes for us to reopen or replace a damaged facility. In addition, any shortages of fuel or significant fuel cost increases could disrupt our ability to distribute products to our customers. Disruptions to the national or local transportation infrastructure systems including those related to a domestic terrorist attack may also affect our ability to keep our operations and services functioning properly. If any of these events were to occur, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to exposure to environmental liabilities and are subject to environmental regulation.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances, rules and regulations including those promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and analogous state agencies. As current and former owners, lessees and operators of real property, we can be held liable for the investigation or remediation of contamination at or from such properties, in some circumstances irrespective of whether we knew of or caused such contamination. No assurance can be provided that investigation and remediation will not be required in the future as a result of spills or releases of petroleum products or hazardous substances, the discovery of currently unknown environmental conditions, more stringent standards regarding existing contamination, or changes in legislation, laws, ordinances, rules or regulations or their interpretation or enforcement. More burdensome environmental regulatory requirements may increase our costs and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.\nOur business employs systems and a website that allow for the secure storage and transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary information. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business. The regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. Our computer systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts and cyber- or phishing-attacks. These events could compromise our confidential information, impede or interrupt our business operations, and may result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, litigation and reputational damage. To date, we have not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity. As cyber-attacks become more sophisticated generally, and as we implement changes giving customers greater electronic access to our systems, we may be required to incur significant costs to strengthen our systems from outside intrusions and/or maintain insurance coverage related to the threat of such attacks. While we have implemented administrative and technical controls and have taken other preventive actions to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our IT, they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nSuccessful continued integration of BMC and SBS and successful operation of the Company in the future are not assured. Also, integrating BMC\u2019s business may divert the attention of management away from operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and grow the continuing businesses and operations of the Company during, and following, the integration of BMC. In addition, the market segments in which the Company operates may experience declines in demand and/or new competitors. Integrating and coordinating certain aspects of the operations, portfolio of products and personnel of BMC and SBS involves complex operational, technological and personnel-related challenges. This process has been and will continue to be time-consuming and expensive, may disrupt the business of the Company and may not result in the full benefits expected from the Merger, including cost synergies expected to arise from efficiencies and overlapping general and administrative functions. The potential difficulties, and resulting costs and delays, include:\n\u2022\nmanaging a larger post-Merger company;\n\u2022\nconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures;\n\u2022\ndifficulties attracting and retaining key personnel;\n\u2022\nloss of customers and suppliers and inability to attract new customers and suppliers;\n\u2022\nissues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems;\n\u2022\nincompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing, administration and other systems and processes; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the Merger or BMC\u2019s legacy business.\nAdditionally, the continued integration of the Company\u2019s operations, products and personnel may place a significant burden on management and other internal resources. The diversion of management\u2019s attention, and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process, could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur continued success will depend on our ability to retain qualified employees, while controlling our labor costs.\nAlong with competing with other companies for many of our employees in hourly and piece work positions, we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs. If we are unable to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, it could adversely impact our operating results. In addition, there is uncertainty about our ability to retain and motivate employees following the Merger. Losses of employees due to different business cultures following the Merger could harm our business and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems.\nOur operations are dependent upon our IT systems, which encompass all of our major business functions. A substantial disruption in our IT systems for any prolonged time period (arising from, for example, system capacity limits from unexpected increases in our volume of business, outages, computer viruses, unauthorized access or delays in our service) could result in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders and adversely affect our customer service and relationships. Our systems might\nbe damaged or interrupted by natural or man-made events or by computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar disruptions affecting the global Internet. Such delays, problems or costs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOperation on multiple ERP information systems, and the conversion from multiple systems to a single system, may negatively impact our operations.\nThe Company currently operates on multiple ERP systems, which we use for operations representing virtually all of our sales. Certain of our ERP systems are proprietary systems that have been highly customized by our computer programmers. We rely upon our ERP systems to manage and replenish inventory, to fill and ship customer orders on a timely basis, to coordinate our sales and distribution activities across all of our products and services and to provide information for financial reporting purposes.\nProcessing, consolidating and reconciling information from multiple ERP systems increases the chance of error, and we may incur significant additional costs related thereto. In markets in which both Legacy Stock and Legacy BMC stores operate, some orders and processes require manual input to consolidate purchasing, inventory, sales and billing functions. Inconsistencies in the information from multiple ERP systems could adversely impact our ability to manage our business efficiently and may result in heightened risk to our ability to maintain accurate books and records and comply with regulatory requirements.\nWe are currently evaluating whether to integrate all operations under one or more of our current ERP systems or continuing to implement a single, new company-wide ERP system which was selected by Legacy BMC prior to the Merger. We are incurring costs associated with designing and implementing this new software. During 2015, we had capital expenditures of $6.4 million for ERP design and implementation, and incurred an additional $1.2 million of non-capitalizable expenses. Capital expenditures and expenses for ERP systems in 2016 and beyond will depend upon whether we decide to operate under one or more of our current ERP systems or a new system, as well as the pace of conversion to a company-wide platform. If implementation is not executed successfully, this could result in business interruptions. If we do not complete the implementation of a company-wide ERP system timely and successfully, we may also incur additional costs associated with this project and a delay in our ability to improve existing operations, to support future growth and to take advantage of new applications and technologies.\nSuch projects are inherently complex, resource intensive, and lengthy. As a result, we could experience unplanned or unforeseen issues that could adversely affect the project, our business or our results of operations, including:\n\u2022\ncosts of implementation that materially exceed our expectations;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention away from normal daily business operations;\n\u2022\nrisk of incurring asset impairment charges, accelerated depreciation expense or other charges related to the early retirement of information system assets or the early termination of information system supplier agreements;\n\u2022\nincreased demand on our operations support personnel;\n\u2022\ndelays in the go-live of one or more of the stages of the project, resulting in additional costs or time for completion;\n\u2022\nerrors in implementation resulting in errors in the commencement or reporting of business transactions;\n\u2022\nfailure in the deliverables of our key partners, suppliers and implementation advisors, resulting in an inferior product, reduced business efficacy and the project not providing expected benefits;\n\u2022\ndeficiencies in the training of employees in the use of the new solution, resulting in errors in the recording of data or transactions, leading to delays in input deliveries and production impairment;\n\u2022\na control failure during or post implementation, which may result in a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting; and\n\u2022\nother implementation issues leading to delays and impacts on our business.\nAny of the foregoing could materially and negatively impact our operating results, cash flows or financial condition.\nOur additional indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\nFollowing the Merger, we have a significant level of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2015, our total debt was $431.7 million, which includes obligations under the Senior Notes and Credit Agreement, as discussed below, as well obligations under capital leases and certain other notes. This leverage could have important consequences, including: making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, and other general corporate purposes; increasing our vulnerability to and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as borrowings under certain of our indebtedness are subject to variable rates of interest; placing the us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and limiting our ability to borrow additional funds.\nOn September 20, 2013, Legacy BMC issued $250.0 million of senior secured notes (the \"Senior Notes\"). The Senior Notes are governed by an indenture dated September 20, 2013 (the \" BMC Indenture\"). Concurrent with the Merger, the Company entered into a second supplemental indenture pursuant to which the Company assumed all obligations of Legacy BMC in relation to the Senior Notes (together with the BMC Indenture, the \"Indenture\").\nOn December 1, 2015, in connection with the Merger, we entered into the Credit Agreement, which includes a revolving line of credit (the \u201cRevolver\u201d). The Revolver has a maximum availability of $450 million, subject to an asset borrowing formula based on eligible accounts receivable, credit card receivables, inventory and fixed assets.\nWe are substantially reliant on liquidity provided by our Credit Agreement and cash on hand to provide working capital and fund our operations. Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements are likely to grow as the housing market improves and we execute our strategic growth plan. Economic and credit market conditions, the performance of the homebuilding industry, and our financial performance, as well as other factors, may constrain our financing abilities. Our ability to secure additional financing, if available, and to satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance, the availability of credit, economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The prolonged continuation or worsening of current housing market conditions and the macroeconomic factors that affect our industry could require us to seek additional capital and have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure such capital on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe may be unable to secure additional financing or financing on favorable terms or our operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under our outstanding indebtedness. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future, including collateralized debt, subject to the restrictions contained in the Credit Agreement and Indenture. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nOur ability to generate net income will depend upon various factors beyond our control. A portion of our debt bears variable rates of interest so our interest expense could increase further in the future. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to pay cash interest on our debt.\nThe Credit Agreement and Indenture contain various covenants that could limit our ability to operate our business.\nThe Credit Agreement and Indenture place limitations on our ability and the ability of and our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur debt, create other liens on its assets, make investments, sell assets, pay dividends, undertake transactions with affiliates, enter into merger transactions and enter into unrelated businesses. The Credit Agreement also contains a financial covenant requiring us and our subsidiaries to maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as defined therein, of at least 1.0:1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter during the period from the date that Excess Availability, as defined therein, under the Credit Agreement is less than or equal to the greater of (1) $40.0 million and (2) 10.0% of the Line Cap under the Credit Agreement until the date that Excess Availability has been greater than the greater of (i) $40.0 million and (ii) 10.0% of the Line Cap for a period of at least 30 consecutive days. The Credit Agreement and Indenture also contain various customary representations and warranties, financial and collateral reporting requirements and other affirmative and negative covenants. Amounts owed under the Credit Agreement and Indenture may be accelerated and the lenders may exercise other remedies available to them upon the occurrence of various events of default set forth in the Credit Agreement and Indenture, including the failure to make principal or interest payments when due, breaches of covenants, representations and warranties set forth in the Credit Agreement and Indenture and defaults under other debt obligations. Any of the foregoing could result in a material increase could materially and negatively impact our operating results, cash flows or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid for them. The market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nchanges in, or failure to meet, earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who track our common stock or the stock of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nthe failure of research analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us, our customers or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nmaterial litigation or government investigations;\n\u2022\nchanges in general conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events;\n\u2022\nchanges in key personnel;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by us, our principal stockholder or members of our management team;\n\u2022\nthe granting or exercise of employee stock options;\n\u2022\npayment of liabilities for which we are self-insured;\n\u2022\nvolume of trading in our common stock;\n\u2022\nthreats to, or impairments of, our intellectual property; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of the factors described elsewhere in \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market has regularly experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Instead, we intend to retain future earnings to fund our growth. In addition, our existing indebtedness restricts, and we anticipate our future indebtedness may restrict, our ability to pay dividends. Therefore, you may not receive a return on your investment in our common stock by receiving a payment of dividends.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares. Before the Merger, Robotti & Company Advisors, LLC (\u201cRobotti\u201d) and its affiliates owned approximately 14% of BMC\u2019s outstanding common stock while Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP (\u201cDK\u201d) and its affiliates owned approximately 28.0% of BMC\u2019s outstanding common stock. Before the Merger, The Gores Group, LLC (\u201cGores\u201d and collectively with DK and Robotti, the \u201cStockholder Group\u201d) owned approximately 38% of our outstanding common stock. As of February 29, 2016, there were approximately 65.3 million shares of our common stock outstanding. Our three largest stockholders, DK, Robotti and Gores own as many as 26.7 million of these shares, with approximately 10.9 million (16.7%) of these shares beneficially owned by DK, approximately 5.8 million (8.9%) of these shares beneficially owned by Robotti and approximately 9.9 million (15.2%) of these shares beneficially owned by Gores.\nIn connection with the Merger, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the Stockholder Group (the \u201cRegistration Rights Agreement\u201d). Under the Registration Rights Agreement, and subject to certain conditions and limitations stated therein,\nwe granted the Stockholder Group registration rights with respect to the shares of Company common stock held by such stockholders. These rights include demand registration rights, shelf registration rights and \u201cpiggyback\u201d registration rights, as well as customary indemnification provisions. The registration rights are subject to certain holdback and suspension periods. We generally will bear all fees, costs and expenses related to registrations, other than underwriting discounts and commissions attributable to the sale of registrable shares by the Stockholder Group under a demand registration or a piggyback registration, as applicable. Sales by the Stockholder Group of a substantial number of shares could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.\nIn connection with the Merger, an amendment to the Stock Building Supply Holdings, Inc. 2013 Incentive Compensation Plan (\"SBS 2013 Incentive Plan\") was approved which increased the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the SBS 2013 Incentive Plan from 1.8 million shares to 5.6 million shares. Of this amount, 1.8 million shares are registered and 3.8 million shares will be registered shortly after the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Of the total 5.6 million shares authorized for issuance under the SBS 2013 Incentive Plan, approximately 3.7 million shares were available for issuance as of February 29, 2016, not including shares underlying outstanding unvested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and outstanding vested and unvested stock options. In addition, as of February 29, 2016, there were issued and outstanding approximately (i) 0.5 million shares of nonvested stock, (ii) 0.3 million RSUs that convert into common stock upon vesting, and (iii) 1.0 million options for the purchase of common stock under the SBS 2013 Incentive Plan. Upon vesting, conversion or exercise as applicable, such registered shares can be freely sold in the public market. If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.\nOur future operating results may fluctuate significantly and our current operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance. Fluctuations in our quarterly financial results could affect our stock price in the future.\nOur revenues and operating results have historically varied from period-to-period and we expect that they will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, our stock price could be negatively affected. Any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock. Our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of future performance.\nFactors associated with our industry, the operation of our business and the markets for our products and services may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate, including:\n\u2022\nthe seasonal and cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry;\n\u2022\nthe highly competitive nature of our industry;\n\u2022\nthe volatility of prices, availability and affordability of raw materials, including lumber, wood products and other building products;\n\u2022\nshortages of skilled and technical labor, increased labor costs and labor disruptions;\n\u2022\nthe production schedules of our customers;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, including but not limited to housing starts, repair and remodeling activity and light commercial construction, inventory levels of new and existing homes for sale, foreclosure rates, interest rates, unemployment rates, relative currency values, mortgage availability and pricing, as well as other consumer financing mechanisms, that ultimately affect demand for our products;\n\u2022\nactions of suppliers, customers and competitors, including merger and acquisition activities, plant closures and financial failures;\n\u2022\nlitigation, claims and investigations involving us;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition and creditworthiness of our customers;\n\u2022\ncost of compliance with government laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nweather patterns; and\n\u2022\nsevere weather phenomena such as drought, hurricanes, tornadoes and fire.\nAny one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial and other operating results, including fluctuations in our key metrics. The variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our internal operating plan or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nCertain provisions of our organizational documents and other contractual provisions may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board of Directors (\"Board\") and may discourage hostile takeover attempts.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of us and our stockholders. The provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\na classified Board with three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nstockholder action can only be taken at a special or regular meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our Board or presenting matters at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nremoval of directors only for cause;\n\u2022\nallowing only our Board to fill vacancies on our Board; and\n\u2022\nsuper-majority voting requirements to amend our amended and restated bylaws and certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the \"Charter\").\nWe have elected in our Charter not to be subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\"Section 203\"), an anti-takeover law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination, such as a merger, with a person or group owning 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless (with certain exceptions) the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly, we are not subject to any anti-takeover effects of Section 203. However, our Charter contains provisions that are substantially similar in effect to Section 203. In general, the anti-takeover provisions in the Charter, like Section 203, prohibit us from engaging in a business combination, such as a merger, with a person or group owning 15% or more of our voting stock for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless (with certain exceptions) the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. The Charter includes specified exceptions from anti-takeover provisions, which provide that (i) in certain circumstances (as described below), DK and Gores (the \u201cGrandfathered Stockholders\u201d) and (ii) any person who would otherwise be an interested stockholder because of a transfer, assignment, conveyance, hypothecation, encumbrance or other disposition of 5% or more of our outstanding voting stock by any Grandfathered Stockholder to such person will be excluded from the \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d definition in the Charter. At any time during the period beginning on the closing date of the Merger and ending on the third anniversary thereof, each Grandfathered Stockholder is permitted to own any amount less than 20% of our outstanding voting stock and will not be deemed an interested stockholder unless such Grandfathered Stockholder\u2019s ownership level meets or exceeds 20% of our outstanding voting stock during such three-year period. From and after the third anniversary of the closing date of the Merger, each Grandfathered Stockholder is permitted to continue owning its respective ownership amount that it owns, together with its affiliates and associates, on such anniversary and will not be deemed an interested stockholder unless such Grandfathered Stockholder\u2019s ownership level later exceeds such ownership amount of our outstanding voting stock. Moreover, each Grandfathered Stockholder, together with its affiliates and associates, may reduce its ownership amount at any time from and after the third anniversary of the effective time of the merger; provided that, if such Grandfathered Stockholder reduces its ownership amount below the ownership amount of such Grandfathered Stockholder that exists on the third anniversary of the effective time of the merger, such Grandfathered Stockholder may not increase its ownership amount above such reduced amount; provided, further, that if such Grandfathered Stockholder reduces its ownership amount below 15% of our outstanding voting stock after the third anniversary of the effective time of the Merger, such Grandfathered Stockholder may own any amount of voting stock below 15% of our outstanding voting stock, in the case of each of the foregoing provisos, without being deemed an interested stockholder.\nWhile these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our Board, they could enable the Board to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nAny issuance of preferred stock could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.\nOur Board has the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to\nthe rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price, and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nOur internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nBMC was not subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires companies to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, as permitted under applicable regulations, management\u2019s annual report on internal control over financial reporting includes a scope limitation excluding the Legacy BMC business for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Item 9A - \u201cControls and Procedures.\u201d\nEnsuring that the Company has adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Implementing appropriate changes to the internal controls of the Company may take a significant period of time to complete, may distract directors, officers and employees, and may entail substantial costs in order to modify existing accounting systems. Further, the Company may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the internal controls, disclosure controls, financial reporting systems and information technology infrastructure of SBS and BMC.\nThe Company\u2019s efforts to assimilate and integrate the internal controls and financial reporting systems of SBS and BMC may not be effective in maintaining the adequacy of internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase the Company\u2019s operating costs and could materially impair its ability to operate its business. In addition, investors\u2019 perceptions that the Company\u2019s internal controls are inadequate or that it is unable to produce accurate financial statements may adversely affect its stock price.\nAdditionally, the Company may experience material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit the Company\u2019s ability to accurately report its cash flows, results of operations or financial condition. If the Company is unable to conclude that its internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if its independent registered public accounting firm determines the Company has a material weakness or significant deficiency in its internal control over financial reporting, the Company could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports, the market price of its common stock could decline and the Company could be subject to sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict its future access to the capital markets and reduce or eliminate the trading market for our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nAs a relatively new public company we may lose research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If we lose securities or industry analyst coverage of our Company, the trading price for our stock may be negatively impacted. If we maintain or obtain new or additional securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 76796, "SIC": 5211, "TIC": "BMCH"}
