{"cik": "790051", "company": "CARLISLE COMPANIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to those set forth below, those set forth in our \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d disclosure in Item 7 and those set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any one of which could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results.\nThe Company\u2019s earnings growth strategy is partially dependent on the acquisition and successful integration of other businesses.\nThe Company has a history of acquiring businesses as part of its earnings growth strategy. Typically, the Company considers acquiring companies than can be integrated within an existing business. Acquisitions of this type involve numerous risks, which may include a failure to realize expected revenue growth and operating and cost synergies from integration initiatives to combine the acquired business with an existing business; increasing dependency on the markets served by the combined businesses; increased debt to finance the acquisitions or the inability to obtain adequate financing on reasonable terms.\nThe Company also considers the acquisition of businesses that may operate independent of existing businesses that involve similar risks with respect to a failure to realize expected revenue growth or operating and cost reductions within the acquired business; and could increase the possibility of diverting corporate management\u2019s attention from its existing operations.\nThe successful realization of revenue growth, cost reductions and synergies with our existing businesses, and within acquired stand-alone businesses, and therefore increases in profitability overall, is dependent upon successful integration initiatives. If these integration initiatives do not occur, there may be a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSee \u201cPart II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for recent acquisition information.\nSeveral of the market segments that the Company serves are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and global economic conditions.\nSeveral of the market segments in which the Company sells its products are, to varying degrees, cyclical and may experience periodic downturns in demand. For example, the CBF segment is susceptible to downturns in the construction, agriculture and mining industries. The CIT segment is susceptible to downturns in the commercial airline industry, and the CCM segment is susceptible to downturns in the commercial construction industry.\nUncertainty regarding global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the businesses, results of operations and financial condition of the Company and its customers, distributors and suppliers. Among the economic factors which may affect performance are: manufacturing activity, commercial and residential construction, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. These effects may, among other things, negatively impact the level of purchases, capital expenditures and creditworthiness of the Company\u2019s customers, distributors and suppliers, and therefore, the Company\u2019s results of operations, margins and orders. The Company cannot predict if, when or how much worldwide economic conditions will fluctuate. These conditions are highly unpredictable and beyond the Company's control. If these conditions deteriorate, however, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe Company is subject to risks arising from international economic, political, legal and business factors.\nThe Company has increased, and anticipates it will continue to increase, its presence in global markets. Approximately 22.7% of the Company\u2019s revenues in 2018 were generated outside the United States. The Company expects these revenues will grow as the Company continues to target global markets. In addition, to compete globally, all of the Company\u2019s segments have manufacturing facilities outside the United States.\nThe Company\u2019s increasing reliance on international revenues and international manufacturing bases exposes its business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to a number of risks, including price and currency controls; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, including import and export tariffs; extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings, acts of terror and riots; political instability; nationalization of private enterprises; hyperinflationary conditions; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations, currency conversion or repatriation of assets; legal systems of decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied; cost and availability of international shipping channels; and customer loyalty to local companies.\nAdditionally, there is uncertainty caused by the U.K.'s planned exit from the European Union commonly referred to as \"Brexit.\" While the specific terms and impact of Brexit are not yet known, Brexit could adversely impact the U.K. and/or the European Union, and therefore the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to regulatory risks.\nCertain products manufactured by our businesses operating in the aerospace and medical markets are subject to extensive regulation by the FAA and FDA, respectively. It can be costly and time-consuming to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals as well as maintain certifications to supply our products to OEM aerospace customers and to obtain regulatory approvals to market medical devices. Product approvals subject to regulations might not be granted\nfor new devices on a timely basis, if at all. Proposed new regulations or changes to regulations could result in the need to incur significant additional costs to comply. Continued government scrutiny, including reviews of the FDA medical device pre-market authorization and post-market surveillance processes, may impact the requirements for our medical device interconnect components. Failure to effectively respond to changes to applicable laws and regulations or comply with existing and future laws and regulations may have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company has significant concentrations in the domestic commercial construction market.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 64.3% of the Company\u2019s revenues and approximately 85.5% of its operating income were generated by the CCM segment. Construction spending is affected by economic conditions, changes in interest rates, demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal, state and local governments. A decline in the commercial construction market could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, adverse weather conditions such as heavy or sustained rainfall, cold weather and snow can limit construction activity and reduce demand for roofing materials. Weather conditions can also be a positive factor, as demand for roofing materials may rise after harsh weather conditions due to the need for replacement materials.\nThe CCM segment competes through pricing, among other factors. Increased competition in this segment has placed, and could continue to place, negative pressure on operating results in future periods.\nThe loss of, or a significant decline in business with, one or more of the Company\u2019s key customers could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company operates in several niche markets in which a large portion of the segment\u2019s revenues are attributable to a few large customers. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Overview-Description of Businesses by Segment\u201d for a discussion of customer concentrations by segment. A significant reduction in purchases by one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of one or more of the Company\u2019s segments.\nSome of the Company\u2019s key customers enjoy significant purchasing power that may be used to exert pricing pressure on the Company. Additionally, as many of the Company\u2019s businesses are part of a long supply chain to the ultimate consumer, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected if one or more key customers elects to in-source or find alternative suppliers for the production of a product or products that the Company currently provides.\nRaw material costs are a significant component of the Company\u2019s cost structure and are subject to volatility.\nThe Company utilizes petroleum-based products, steel and other commodities in its manufacturing processes. Raw materials, including inbound freight, accounted for approximately 60% of the Company\u2019s cost of goods sold in 2018. Significant increases in the price of these materials may not be recovered through selling price increases and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company also relies on global sources of raw materials, which could be adversely impacted by unfavorable shipping or trade arrangements, including import and export tariffs and global economic conditions. Refer to \u201cPart II-Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for additional information regarding commodity price risk.\nDispositions, failure to successfully complete dispositions or restructuring activities could negatively affect the Company.\nFrom time to time, the Company, as part of its commitment to concentrate on its core business, may dispose of all or a portion of certain businesses. Such dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management's attention from the Company\u2019s core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses, potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on the Company\u2019s earnings per share. If dispositions are not completed in a timely manner, there may be a negative effect on the Company\u2019s cash flows and/or the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategy.\nAdditionally, from time to time, the Company may undertake consolidation and other restructuring projects in an effort to reduce costs and streamline its operations. Such restructuring activities may divert management's attention from\nthe Company\u2019s core businesses, increase expenses on a short-term basis and lead to potential disputes with the employees, customers or suppliers of the affected businesses. If restructuring activities are not completed in a timely manner or if anticipated cost savings, synergies and efficiencies are not realized, there may be a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRefer to Notes 4 and 8 for a discussion of current disposition and restructuring matters.\nCurrency fluctuation could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s reported results of business operations.\nThe Company\u2019s global revenues and other activities are translated into U.S. Dollars (\"USD\") for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the USD could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into USD. In addition, sales and purchases in currencies other than the USD expose the Company to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the USD. Increased strength of the USD will decrease the Company\u2019s reported revenues or margins in respect of sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent the Company is unable or determines not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, decreased strength of the USD could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas. Many of the Company\u2019s sales that are exported by its U.S. subsidiaries to foreign countries are denominated in USD, reducing currency exposure. However, increased strength of the USD may decrease the competitiveness of our U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 products that are sold in USD within foreign locations.\nThe Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the exposure of certain of our results of operations and cash flows to such fluctuations. See \u201cPart II-Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for a discussion on foreign currency exchange risk.\nSecurity breaches or significant disruptions of our information technology systems or violations of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support critical business processes. Security breaches of these systems could result in the unauthorized or inappropriate access to confidential information or personal data entrusted to us by our business partners. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, security breaches to our information technology systems, none of them to date has had a material impact on the Company. Additionally, these systems may be disrupted as a result of attacks by computer hackers or viruses, human error or wrongdoing, operational failures or other catastrophic events. The Company leverages its internal information technology infrastructures, and those of its business partners, to enable, sustain and protect its global business interests, however, any of the aforementioned breaches or disruptions could result in legal claims, liability or penalties under privacy laws or damage to operations or to the Company's reputation, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of business. If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to privacy and security requirements, we may suffer regulatory consequences that could be costly or otherwise adversely affect our business.", "PERMNO": 27334, "SIC": 2950, "TIC": "CSL"}
