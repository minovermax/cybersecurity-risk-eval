{"cik": "1036848", "company": "Mega Matrix Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our common stock involves risks. Prior to making a decision about investing in our common stock, you should consider carefully the risks together with all of the other information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, and in our subsequent filings with the SEC. Each of the referenced risks and uncertainties could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. Additional risks not known to us or that we believe are immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition and the value of an investment in our securities.\nRisks Related to our Business\nThe GameFi industry is new and developing and there is no assurance that our games currently under development will be accepted by players.\nThe development of the GameFi industry is new and continues to rapidly evolve. We intend to develop games with a \u201cPlay-to-Earn\u201d model that allows players to earn financial rewards through NFT while they play in Mega\u2019s metaverse universe \u201calSpace\u201d. Our first NFT game was released on March 25, 2022. However, no assurance can be made that Mano will generate enough interest in order for players to use, trade, and sell their Mano NFTs.\nThe creation of NFTs for our games is dependent on our ability to develop an acceptable blockchain.\nOur ability to create NFTs that can be minted, accepted and transferred is dependent on our ability to develop or engage a third party to develop an accepted and secured blockchain. Failure to develop or engage a third party to develop a secured and reliable blockchain, will adversely affect our ability to create a marketplace where players and users trade and sell their NFTs.\nOur alSpace universe is still currently under development and no assurance can be given that our alSpace platform will be accepted by others or generate sufficient interest.\nOur alSpace metaverse platform is still currently being developed and undergoing upgrades. It is our intent that the alSpace universe will (i) support our NFT games to launch; (ii) provide an engine and studio where creators can create their own game and use alSpace; and (iii) create a marketplace where players and users place their in-game NFT other NFT to sell and trade. Failure to develop a robust alSpace metaverse universe will adversely affect our business objectives.\nOur business will be intensely competitive. We may not deliver successful and engaging games, or players and consumers may prefer our competitors\u2019 products over our own.\nAlthough the development of the GameFi industry is new, we anticipate that competition in our business will be intense. Many new products will be introduced, but we anticipate that only a relatively small number of products will drive significant engagement and account for a significant portion of total revenue. It is anticipated that our competitors will range from mature well-funded companies to emerging start-ups. If we do not develop consistent high-quality, well-received and engaging products that are of interest to players, the lack of interest will adversely affect our business objectives.\nThere can be no assurance that the market for NFTs will be developed and/or sustained, which may materially adversely affect the value of NFTs.\nThe market for digital assets, including, without limitation, NFTs, whether related to in-game assets or otherwise, is still nascent. Accordingly, the market for NFTs may not develop, or if a market does develop, such value be maintained. If a market does not develop for the NFTs, it may be difficult or impossible for us to maintain a marketplace where players and users can trade and eventually sell their NFTs. Failure to develop a marketplace for our NFTs will adversely affect our business objectives.\nOur business will suffer to some extent if we are unable to continue to develop successful games for alSpace, successfully monetize alSpace games, or successfully forecast alSpace launches and/or monetization.\nOur business depends in part on developing and publishing alSpace games including Mano for live online players for earning NFTs, and that such consumers will download and spend time playing. We have devoted and we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to development, analytics and marketing of our alSpace games, however we cannot guarantee that we will continue to develop games that appeal to players. The success of our games depend, in part, on unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control including consumer preferences, competing games, new metaverse platforms and the availability of other entertainment experiences. If our games are not launched on time or do not meet consumer expectations, or if they are not brought to market in a timely and effective manner, our ability to grow revenue and our financial performance will be negatively affected.\nIn addition to the market factors noted above, our ability to successfully develop games for alSpace and our ability to achieve commercial success will depend on our ability to:\n\u25cf effectively market the alSpace games to existing gamers and new gamers without excess costs;\n\u25cf effectively monetize the games;\n\u25cf adapt to changing player preferences;\n\u25cf expand and enhance the alSpace games after their initial releases;\n\u25cf attract, retain and motivate talented game designers, product managers and engineers who have experience developing games for metaverse platforms;\n\u25cf minimize launch delays and cost overruns on the development of our alSpace games;\n\u25cf maintain quality alSpace game experience;\n\u25cf compete successfully against a large and growing number of existing market participants;\n\u25cf minimize and quickly resolve bugs or outages; and\n\u25cf acquire and successfully integrate high quality metaverse assets, personnel or companies.\nThese and other uncertainties make it difficult to know whether we will succeed in continuing to develop successful alSpace games and launch these games in accordance with our financial plan. If we do not succeed in doing so, our business model for this particular part will suffer.\nWe have a relatively new history in developing and launching metaverse games. As a result, we may have difficulty predicting the development schedule of our new games and forecasting bookings for a game. If launches are delayed and we are unable to monetize the alSpace game in the manner that we forecast, our ability to grow revenue and our financial performance will be negatively impacted.\nOne primary strategy to grow our business is to develop NFTs and games for alSpace. If we are not able to attract players to our GameFi platform, our financial position and operating results may suffer.\nThe technology underlying blockchain technology is subject to a number of industry-wide challenges and risks relating to consumer acceptance of blockchain technology. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of blockchain networks and blockchain assets would have a material adverse effect on the successful adoption of the NFTs.\nThe growth of the blockchain industry is subject to a high degree of uncertainty regarding consumer adoption and long-term development. The factors affecting the further development of the blockchain and NFT industry include, without limitation:\n\u25cf worldwide growth in the adoption and use of NFTs and other blockchain technologies;\n\u25cf government and quasi-government regulation of NFTs and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of blockchain networks or similar systems;\n\u25cf the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of blockchain networks;\n\u25cf changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;\n\u25cf the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, or trading assets, including new means of using government-backed currencies or existing networks;\n\u25cf the extent to which current interest in NFTs represents a speculative \u201cbubble\u201d;\n\u25cf general economic conditions in the United States and the world;\n\u25cf the regulatory environment relating to NFTs and blockchains; and\n\u25cf a decline in the popularity or acceptance of NFTs or other digital assets.\nThe NFT industry as a whole has been characterized by rapid changes and innovations and is constantly evolving. Although it has experienced significant growth in recent years, the slowing or stopping of the development, general acceptance and adoption and usage of blockchain networks and blockchain assets may deter or delay the acceptance and adoption of NFTs.\nThe slowing or stopping of the development, general acceptance and adoption and usage of blockchain networks or blockchain assets may adversely impact the value of NFTs. The value of specific NFTs relies on the development, general acceptance and adoption and usage of the applicable blockchain network which depends on ability to readily access the applicable network.\nThe prices of digital assets are extremely volatile, and such volatility may have a material adverse effect on the value of alSpace NFTs.\nDecreases in the price of even a single other digital asset may cause volatility in the entire digital asset industry and may affect the value of other digital assets, including any alSpace NFTs. For example, a security breach or any other incident or set of circumstances that affects purchaser or user confidence in a well-known digital asset may affect the industry as a whole and may also cause the price of other digital assets, including NFTs, to fluctuate.\nThe value of in-game asset NFTs relies in part on the development, general acceptance and adoption and usage of blockchain assets, rather than solely on the in-game asset itself.\nIn-game asset NFTs are a means to establish proof of ownership of in-game assets through cryptographic key pairs, the public key of the creator(s) who created the in-game asset and the private key of the holder representing a verified instance (whether unique or part of a series) of that in-game asset. The purchase of an in-game asset NFT gives the holder the right to hold, transfer and/or sell the NFT. The NFT does not itself include any physical manifestation of the in-game asset. The value of in-game asset NFTs is derived from the cryptographic record of ownership, rather than solely on the in-game asset itself (alBots and other in-game items); an in-game asset originated as an NFT (i.e., the actual file or files constituting the in-game asset of which ownership is represented by an NFT) may have no value absent the NFT, depending on what other rights were conveyed with the NFT, for example a copyright interest that could be transferred separate from the NFT. Thus, the value of the in-game asset NFT relies in part on the continued development, acceptance, adoption and usage of the applicable blockchain.\nExpansion of our operations into new products, services and technologies, including content categories, is inherently risky and may subject us to additional business, legal, financial and competitive risks.\nHistorically, our operations have been focused on third-party management service contracts for aircraft operations. Further expansion of our operations and our marketplace into additional products and services, such as NFTs involves numerous risks and challenges, including potential new competition, increased capital requirements and increased marketing spent to achieve customer awareness of these new products and services. Growth into additional content, product and service areas may require changes to our existing business model and cost structure and modifications to our infrastructure and may expose us to new regulatory and legal risks, any of which may require expertise in areas in which we have little or no experience. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue from sales of such products and services to offset the costs of developing, acquiring, managing and monetizing such products and services and our business may be adversely affected.\nIf we cannot continue to innovate technologically or develop, market and sell new products and services, or enhance existing technology and products and services to meet customer requirements, our ability to grow our revenue could be impaired.\nOur growth largely depends on our ability to innovate and add value to our existing creative platform and to provide our customers and contributors with a scalable, high-performing technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably handle increased customer and contributor usage globally, as well as the deployment of new features. For example, NFTs require additional capital and resources. Without improvements to our technology and infrastructure, our operations might suffer from unanticipated system disruptions, slow performance or unreliable service levels, any of which could negatively affect our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers and contributors. We are currently making, and plan to continue making, significant investments to maintain and enhance the technology and infrastructure and to evolve our information processes and computer systems in order to run our business more efficiently and remain competitive. We may not achieve the anticipated benefits, significant growth or increased market share from these investments for several years, if at all. If we are unable to manage our investments successfully or in a cost-efficient manner, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe value of NFT is uncertain and may subject us to unforeseeable risks.\nWe create and support NFTs. NFTs are unique, one-of-a-kind digital assets made possible by certain digital asset network protocols. Because of their non-fungible nature, NFTs introduce digital scarcity and have become popular as online \u201ccollectibles,\u201d similar to physical rare collectible items, such as trading cards or art. Like real world collectibles, the value of NFTs may be prone to \u201cboom and bust\u201d cycles as popularity increases and subsequently subsides. If any of these bust cycles were to occur, it could adversely affect the value of certain of our future strategies. In addition, because NFTs generally rely on the same types of underlying technologies as digital assets, most risks applicable to digital assets are also applicable to NFTs and hence our creation of NFTs will be subject to general digital assets risks as described elsewhere in these risk factors.\nA particular digital asset\u2019s status as a \u201csecurity\u201d in any relevant jurisdiction is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and depending upon the activities undertaken by our customers utilizing our products and services, we and our customers may be subject to regulatory scrutiny, investigations, fines, and other penalties, which may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe SEC and its staff have taken the position that certain digital assets fall within the definition of a \u201csecurity\u201d under the U.S. federal securities laws. The legal test for determining whether any given digital asset is a security is a highly complex, fact-driven analysis that evolves over time, and the outcome is difficult to predict. The SEC generally does not provide advance guidance or confirmation on the status of any particular asset as a security. Furthermore, the SEC\u2019s views in this area have evolved over time and it is difficult to predict the direction or timing of any continuing evolution. With respect to various digital assets, there is currently no certainty under the applicable legal test that such assets are not securities, notwithstanding the conclusions we may draw based on our risk-based assessment regarding the likelihood that a particular asset could be deemed a \u201csecurity\u201d under applicable laws.\nThe classification of a digital asset as a security under applicable law has wide-ranging implications for the regulatory obligations that flow from the offer, sale and trading of such assets. For example, a digital asset that is a security in the United States may generally only be offered or sold in the United States pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC or in an offering that qualifies for an exemption from registration. Persons that effect transactions in assets that are securities in the United States may be subject to registration with the SEC as a \u201cbroker\u201d or \u201cdealer.\u201d Platforms that bring together purchasers and sellers to trade digital assets that are securities in the United States are generally subject to registration as national securities exchanges, or must qualify for an exemption, such as by being operated by a registered broker-dealer as an alternative trading system, or ATS, in compliance with rules for ATSs. Persons facilitating clearing and settlement of securities may be subject to registration with the SEC as a clearing agency. Foreign jurisdictions may have similar licensing, registration, and qualification requirements.\nIf the SEC, foreign regulatory authority, or a court were to determine that a supported digital asset offered, sold, or traded by one of our customers on a platform provided by us is a security, our customer would not be able to offer such asset for trading until it was able to do so in a compliant manner, which would require significant expenditures by the customer. In addition, we or our customer could be subject to judicial or administrative sanctions for failing to offer or sell the digital asset in compliance with the registration requirements, or for acting as a broker, dealer, or national securities exchange without appropriate registration. Such an action could result in injunctions, cease and desist orders, as well as civil monetary penalties, fines, disgorgement, criminal liability, and reputational harm which could negatively impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Company\nOur filing of bankruptcy may adversely affect our business and relationships.\nOn August 31, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Approving and Confirming the Combined Disclosure Statement and Joint Chapter 11 Plan of AeroCentury Corp., and its Affiliated Debtors. The Effective Date of the Plan occurred on September 30, 2021. Each condition precedent to consummation of the Plan has been satisfied and/or waived.\nAs a result of our bankruptcy filing:\n\u25cf suppliers, vendors or other contract counterparties may require additional financial assurances or enhanced performance from us;\n\u25cf our ability to compete for new business may be adversely affected;\n\u25cf our ability to attract, motivate and retain key executives and employees may be adversely affected;\n\u25cf our employees may be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other employment opportunities; and\n\u25cf we may have difficulty obtaining the capital we need to operate and grow our business.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nUpon our emergence from Chapter 11, the composition of our stockholder base has changed significantly.\nAs a result of the concentration of our equity ownership, our future strategy and plans may differ materially from those in the past. Upon our emergence from Chapter 11, the Plan Sponsors collectively held approximately 65.0% of our common stock, while holders of our legacy equity interests held approximately 35.0% of our common stock. Therefore, the Plan Sponsors have significant control on the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including, but not limited to, electing directors and approving corporate transactions. As a result, our future strategy and plans may differ materially from those of the past. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of the Plan Sponsors could be in conflict with the interests of other stockholders, and the Plan Sponsors would have substantial influence to cause us to take actions that align with their interests. Should conflicts arise, there can be no assurance that the Plan Sponsors would act in the best interests of other stockholders or that any conflicts of interest would be resolved in a manner favorable to our other stockholders.\nThe composition of our board of directors has changed significantly.\nPursuant to the Plan, the composition of our board of directors changed significantly. Upon our emergence from Chapter 11, our board of directors consisted of five directors, none of whom had previously served on our board of directors. The new directors have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those who previously served on our board of directors and thus may have different views on the issues that will determine our future. There can be no assurance that our new board of directors will pursue, or will pursue in the same manner, our previous strategy and business plans.\nCertain information contained in our historical financial statements are not comparable to the information contained in our financial statements after the adoption of fresh start accounting.\nUpon our emergence from Chapter 11, we adopted fresh start accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 852 and became a new entity for financial reporting purposes. As a result, we revalued our assets and liabilities based on our estimate of our enterprise value and the fair value of each of our assets and liabilities. These estimates, projections and enterprise valuation were prepared solely for the purpose of the bankruptcy proceedings and should not be relied upon by investors for any other purpose. At the time they were prepared, the determination of these values reflected numerous estimates and assumptions, and the fair values recorded based on these estimates may not be fully realized in periods subsequent to our emergence from Chapter 11.\nThe consolidated financial statements after our emergence from bankruptcy will not be comparable to the consolidated financial statements on or before that date. This will make it difficult for stockholders to assess our performance in relation to prior periods.\nWe have a limited operating history in our post-bankruptcy new focus business, so there is a limited track record on which to judge our business prospects and management.\nWe have limited operating history in GameFi, NFT and metaverse upon which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects. You must consider the risks and difficulties we face as a small operating company with limited operating history. Further, our additional game development for metaverse games is a new venture, to which we have no experience and will rely upon our third party developers to develop such a game.\nWe may need to raise additional capital by issuing additional securities which could hurt the market for our securities or be on terms more favorable than those of our current shareholders.\nWe will need to, or desire to, raise substantial additional capital in the future if this funding is not fully carried out. Our future capital requirements will depend on the costs of establishing or acquiring sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities for our services inducing sales of AlBots, the gaming portion of the company, and operations and other potential unforeseen circumstances.\nOur business depends on the continuing efforts of our management. If it loses their services, our business may be severely disrupted.\nOur business operations depend on the efforts of our new management, particularly the executive officers named in this document. If one or more of our management were unable or unwilling to continue their employment with us, it might not be able to replace them in a timely manner, or at all. We may incur additional expenses to recruit and retain qualified replacements. Our business may be severely disrupted, and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our management may join a competitor or form a competing company. As a result, our business may be negatively affected due to the loss of one or more members of our management.\nWe may not be able to prevent or timely detect cyber security breaches and may be subject to data, security and/or system breaches which could adversely affect our business operations and financial conditions.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the use of third-party communications systems over the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support our business activities. These information technology networks and systems may be subject to security breaches, hacking, phishing, or spoofing attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our business information and financial accounts. A cyberattack, unauthorized intrusion, or theft of personal, financial or sensitive business information could have a material adverse effect of on our business operations or our clients\u2019 information, and could harm our operations, reputation and financial situation. In addition, due to an increase in the types of cyberattacks, our employees could be victim to such scams designed to trick victims into transferring sensitive company data or funds, that could compromise and/or disrupt our business operations.\nWe were a victim of a business email compromise scam (BEC) in December 2021. BEC scams involve using social engineering to cause employees to wire funds to the perpetrators in the mistaken belief that the requests were made by a company executive or established vendor. As a result of the BEC scam, we have enhanced BEC awareness within our organization, established additional controls to help detect BEC scams when they occur, and require additional confirmations for large money transactions. In addition, we seek to detect and investigate all cybersecurity incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude, duration, and effects. While we take every effort to train our employees to be cognizant of these types of attacks and to take appropriate precautions, and have taken actions and implemented controls to protect our systems and information, the level of technological sophistication being used by attackers has increased in recent years, and may be insufficient to protect our systems or information. Any successful cyberattack against us could lead to the loss of significant company funds or result in in potential liability, including litigation or other legal actions against us, or the imposition of penalties, which could cause us to incur significant remedial costs. Further, we cannot ensure that our efforts and measures taken will be sufficient to prevent or mitigate any damage caused by a cybersecurity incident, and our networks and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches, hacking, phishing, spoofing, BEC, employee error or manipulation, or other adverse events.\nDue to the evolving nature and increased sophistication of these cybersecurity threats, the potential impact of any future incident cannot be predicted with certainty; however, any such incidents could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, especially if we fail to maintain sufficient insurance coverage to cover liabilities incurred or are unable to recover any funds lost in data, security and/or system breaches, and could result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective, and if we continue to fail to improve such controls and procedures, investors could lose confidence in our financial and other reports, the price of our common stock may decline, and we may be subject to increased risks and liabilities.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual reports with respect to our business and financial condition. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we include a report of our management on our internal control over financial reporting. We are also required to include certifications of our management regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. We previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to our tax review control for complex transactions. We are in the process of enhancing our tax review control related to unusual transactions that we may encounter, but that control has not operated for a sufficient time to determine if the control was effective as of December 31, 2021. If we cannot effectively maintain our controls and procedures, we could suffer material misstatements in our financial statements and other information we report which would likely cause investors to lose confidence. This lack of confidence could lead to a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nCompliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will require substantial financial and management resources and may increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls and may require us to have such system audited by an independent registered public accounting firm. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties and/or shareholder litigation. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports could harm our business. Furthermore, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation of adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.\nThe trading prices of our common stock could be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to our shareholders and investors.\nThe trading prices of our common stock could be volatile and could fluctuate widely due to factors beyond our control. This may happen because of broad market and industry factors, like the performance and fluctuation in the market prices or the underperformance or deteriorating financial results of other similarly situated companies that have listed their securities in the U.S. in recent years. The securities of some of these companies have experienced significant volatility including, in some cases, substantial price declines in the trading prices of their securities. In addition, securities markets may from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to our operating performance, such as the large decline in share prices in the United States and other jurisdictions.\nIn addition to market and industry factors, the price and trading volume for our common stock may be highly volatile for factors specific to our own operations including the following:\n\u25cf variations in our revenues, earnings and cash flow;\n\u25cf\nmarket conditions in the GameFi and NFT services sectors or the economy as a whole;\n\u25cf announcements of new product and service offerings, investments, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in the performance or market valuation of our company or our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u25cf changes in the number of our users and customers;\n\u25cf fluctuations in our operating metrics;\n\u25cf failures on our part to realize monetization opportunities as expected;\n\u25cf additions or departures of our key management and personnel;\n\u25cf detrimental negative publicity about us, our competitors or our industry;\n\u25cf market conditions or regulatory developments affecting us or our industry; and\n\u25cf potential litigations or regulatory investigations.\nAny of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the trading volume and the price at which our common stock will trade. In the past, shareholders of a public company often brought securities class action suits against the listed company following periods of instability in the market price of that company\u2019s securities. If we were involved in a class action suit, it could divert a significant amount of our management\u2019s attention and other resources from our business and operations, which could harm our results of operations and require us to incur significant expenses to defend the suit. Any such class action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future. In addition, if a claim is successfully made against us, we may be required to pay significant damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our common stock becomes subject to the SEC\u2019s penny stock rules, broker-dealers may experience difficulty in completing customer transactions, and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected.\nIf at any time we have net tangible assets of $5,000,001 or less and our common stock has a market price per share of less than $5.00, transactions in our common stock may be subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules promulgated under the Exchange Act. Under these rules, broker-dealers who recommend such securities to persons other than institutional accredited investors must:\n\u25cf make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser;\n\u25cf receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction prior to sale;\n\u25cf provide the purchaser with risk disclosure documents which identify certain risks associated with investing in \u201cpenny stocks\u201d and which describe the market for these \u201cpenny stocks\u201d as well as a purchaser\u2019s legal remedies; and\n\u25cf obtain a signed and dated acknowledgment from the purchaser demonstrating that the purchaser has actually received the required risk disclosure document before a transaction in a \u201cpenny stock\u201d can be completed.\nIf our common stock becomes subject to these rules, broker-dealers may find it difficult to effectuate customer transactions and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected. As a result, the market price of our common stock may be depressed, and you may find it more difficult to sell our common stock.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not develop, and you may not be able to easily sell your common stock.\nAn active trading market for shares of our common stock following our emergence from bankruptcy may never develop or be sustained. If an active trading market does not develop, you may have difficulty selling your shares of common stock or at all. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling our common stock, and it may impair our ability to attract and motivate our employees through equity incentive awards and our ability to acquire other companies by using our common stock as consideration.\nIf we do not continue to satisfy the NYSE American continued listing requirements, our common stock could be delisted.\nThe listing of our common stock on NYSE American is contingent on our compliance with the NYSE American\u2019s conditions for continued listing.\nOn September 11, 2020, we received a deficiency letter from NYSE American notifying us of our non-compliance with NYSE American\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity listing standards as set forth in Section 1003(a)(i) - (iii) of the NYSE American Company Guide. Subsequently, we submitted a plan to the NYSE American to bring us into compliance with such listing standards within 18 months of receipt of the deficiency letter. On November 25, 2020, we received a letter from the NYSE American notifying us of its acceptance of our plan and our continuing listing pursuant to an extension with a target completion date of March 11, 2022.\nAs a result of management\u2019s efforts, on March 11, 2022, the NYSE American informed the Company that it has has regained compliance with all of the NYSE American continued listing standards set forth in Part 10 of the Company Guide.\nShould we fail to meet the NYSE American\u2019s continuing listing requirements, we may be subject to delisting by the NYSE America. In the event our common stock is no longer listed for trading on the NYSE American, our trading volume and share price may decrease and we may experience difficulties in raising capital which could materially affect our operations and financial results. Further, delisting from the NYSE American could also have other negative effects, including potential loss of confidence by partners, lenders, suppliers and employees. Finally, delisting could make it harder for us to raise capital and sell securities.\nSales of a significant number of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nIn connection with a private placement of 2,870,927 (14,354,635 post-split) shares of common stock that closed on September 30, 2021, we have filed a registration statement allowing the holders thereof to resell the common stock. The sales of those shares of common stock in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock would have on the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 85757, "SIC": 7359, "TIC": "ACY"}
