RISK FACTORS\nThe following important risk factors, and those risk factors described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in forward-looking statements contained in this document and elsewhere. These risks are not presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Further, the risks described below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or liquidity.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain capital on favorable terms to finance our growth through the purchase of aircraft and to repay or refinance our outstanding debt obligations as they mature. If we are not able to obtain capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all, it would significantly impact our ability to compete effectively in the commercial aircraft leasing market and would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nGrowing our fleet will require substantial additional capital. Accordingly, we will need to obtain additional financing, which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all. Further, we must continue to have access to the capital markets and other sources of financing in order to repay or refinance our outstanding obligations as they mature. Our access to sources of financing will depend upon a number of factors over which we have limited control, including:\n\u25cf general market conditions;\n\u25cf the market's view of the quality of our assets;\n\u25cf the market's perception of our growth potential;\n\u25cf the market's assessment of our credit risk;\n\u25cf interest rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf our historical, current and potential future earnings and cash distributions;\n\u25cf the relative attractiveness of alternative investments; and\n\u25cf the trading prices of our debt securities and preferred and common equity securities.\nWeaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively affect our ability to obtain financing or could increase the costs of financing. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, many companies experienced downward pressure on their share prices and had limited or no access to the credit markets, often without regard to their underlying financial strength. If financial market disruption and volatility were to occur again, we cannot assure you that we will be able to access capital, which would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nIn addition, if there are new regulatory capital requirements imposed on our private lenders, they may be required to limit, or increase the cost of, financing they provide to us. In general, this could potentially increase our financing costs and reduce our liquidity or require us to sell assets at an inopportune time or price.\nIf we are unable to raise additional funds or obtain capital on terms acceptable to us, we may not be able to satisfy funding requirements for any aircraft acquisition commitments then in place. If we are unable to satisfy our purchase commitments, we may be forced to forfeit our deposits. Further, we would be exposed to potential breach of contract claims by our lessees and manufacturers. These risks may also be increased by the volatility and disruption in\nthe capital and credit markets. Depending on market conditions at the time, we may have to rely more heavily on additional equity issuances, which may be dilutive to our stockholders, or on less efficient forms of debt financing that require a larger portion of our cash flow from operations, thereby reducing funds available for our operations, future business opportunities and other purposes. Further, because our charter permits the issuance of preferred stock, if our board of directors approves the issuance of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock or any other preferred stock in a future financing transaction, such stockholders of Series A Preferred Stock will, and such preferred stockholders may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to existing stockholders, and you will not have the ability to approve such a transaction. These risks would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness incurred to acquire our aircraft requires significant debt service payments which could negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nWe and our subsidiaries have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, our total consolidated indebtedness, net of discounts and issuance costs, was approximately $13.6 billion and our interest payments were $442.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Furthermore, we expect these amounts to grow as we acquire more aircraft. Our level of debt could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u25cf making it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations with respect to our debt;\n\u25cf limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund the acquisition of aircraft or for other corporate requirements;\n\u25cf requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for dividends, aircraft acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf increasing our vulnerability to general negative economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our various credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u25cf limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the aircraft industry;\n\u25cf placing us at a disadvantage compared to other competitors; and\n\u25cf increasing our cost of borrowing.\nIn addition, certain agreements governing our existing indebtedness contain financial maintenance covenants that require us to satisfy certain ratios and maintain minimum net worth, and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in additional interest being due and/or an event of default which, if not cured or waived, may allow holders of our debt securities or our lenders, as applicable, to accelerate some or all our debt, terminate commitments to lend money, foreclose against the aircraft, if any, securing such debt or pursue other remedies, all of which would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nAn increase in our borrowing costs would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nWe finance many of the aircraft in our fleet through a combination of short-term and long-term debt financings. As these debt financings mature, we may have to refinance these existing commitments by entering into new financings, which could result in higher borrowing costs, or repay them by using cash on hand or cash from the sale of our assets. Moreover, an increase in interest rates under the various debt financing facilities we have in place would have a negative effect on our earnings and could make our aircraft leasing contracts unprofitable.\nSome of our debt financings bear interest at a floating rate, such that our interest expense will vary with changes in the applicable reference rate. As a result, our inability to sufficiently protect ourselves from changes in our cost of borrowing, as reflected in our composite interest rate, may have a direct, negative impact on our net income. Our lease rental stream is generally fixed over the life of our leases, whereas we have used floating-rate debt to finance some of our aircraft acquisitions. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1.6 billion in floating-rate debt. If interest rates increase, we would be obligated to make higher interest payments to the lenders of our floating-rate debt. If our composite interest rate were to increase by 1.0%, we would expect to incur additional interest expense on our existing indebtedness as of December 31, 2019, of approximately $15.9 million on an annualized basis, which would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations. Further, as we continue to incur fixed-rate debt, increased interest rates prevailing in the market at the time of the incurrence of such debt would also increase our interest expense.\nAs such, if interest rates were to rise sharply, we would not be able to fully offset immediately the negative impact on our net income by increasing lease rates, even if the market were able to bear such increases in lease rates. Our leases are generally for multiple years with fixed lease rates over the life of the lease and, therefore, lags will exist because our lease rates with respect to a particular aircraft cannot generally be increased until the expiration of the lease.\nThe interest rates that we obtain on our debt financings have several components, including credit spreads, swap spreads, duration, and new issue premiums. These are all incremental to the underlying risk-free rates, as applicable. Volatility in our perceived risk of default or in our market sector's risk of default will negatively impact our cost of funds.\nWe currently are not involved in any interest rate hedging activities. Any such hedging activities will require us to incur additional costs, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully protect ourselves from any or all negative interest rate fluctuations at a reasonable cost.\nNegative changes in our credit ratings or being put on negative watch may limit our ability to obtain financing or increase our borrowing costs which would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nWe are currently subject to periodic review by independent credit rating agencies S&P, Fitch and Kroll, each of which currently maintains investment-grade credit ratings with respect to us and certain of our debt financings, and we may become subject to periodic review by other independent credit rating agencies in the future. An increase in the level of our outstanding indebtedness, or other events that could have a negative impact on our business, properties, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, may cause S&P, Fitch or Kroll, or, in the future, other rating agencies, to downgrade or withdraw their respective credit rating with respect to us or our debt financings, which could negatively impact our ability to secure financing and increase our borrowing costs.\nWe cannot assure you that these credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agency, if, in such rating agency's sole judgment, circumstances so warrant. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security. Each agency's rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency's rating. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could increase our corporate borrowing costs and limit our access to the capital markets which would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nFailure to close our aircraft acquisition commitments could negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had entered into binding purchase commitments to acquire a total of 413 new aircraft for delivery through 2026. If we are unable to maintain our financing sources or find new sources of financing or if the various conditions to our existing commitments are not satisfied, we may be unable to close the purchase of some\nor all of the aircraft which we have commitments to acquire. If our aircraft acquisition commitments are not closed for these or other reasons, we will be subject to several risks, including the following:\n\u25cf forfeiting deposits and progress payments and having to pay and expense certain significant costs relating to these commitments, such as contractual damages, and legal, accounting and financial advisory expenses, not realizing any of the benefits of completing the transactions and damage to our reputation and relationship with aircraft manufacturers;\n\u25cf defaulting on our lease commitments, which could result in monetary damages and damage to our reputation and relationships with lessees; and\n\u25cf failing to capitalize on other aircraft acquisition opportunities that were not pursued due to our management's focus on these commitments.\nIf we determine that the capital we require to satisfy these commitments may not be available to us, either at all or on terms we deem attractive, we may eliminate or reduce any dividend program that may be in place at that time in order to preserve capital to apply to these commitments. These risks would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nCertain of the agreements governing our indebtedness may limit our operational flexibility, our ability to effectively compete and our ability to grow our business as currently planned, which would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nCertain of the agreements governing our indebtedness, including our credit facilities, contain financial and non-financial covenants, such as requirements that we comply with one or more of the following covenants: maximum debt-to-equity ratios, minimum interest coverage ratios, minimum net worth, minimum unencumbered assets, dividend and investment restrictions, limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to incur debt, limitations on engaging in certain mergers and consolidations, change of control provisions, and prohibitions against creating certain liens on our assets and disposing of our aircraft or other aviation assets without a lender\u2019s prior consent. Complying with such covenants may at times necessitate that we forego other opportunities, such as using available cash to grow our aircraft fleet or promptly disposing of less profitable aircraft or other aviation assets. Moreover, our failure to comply with any of these covenants would likely constitute a default under such agreements and could give rise to an acceleration of some, if not all, of our then outstanding indebtedness, which would have a negative effect on our business and our ability to continue as a going concern. If we were unable to repay the indebtedness when due and payable, secured lenders could proceed against, among other things, the aircraft securing such indebtedness, if any.\nIn addition, we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt and grow our operations as planned. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, we cannot assure you that in the future we will be able to access long-term financing or credit support on attractive terms, if at all, or qualify for guarantees, or obtain attractive terms for such guarantees, from the export credit agencies. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow, maintain our existing fleet and facilities, or access long-term financing or credit support would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nThe value of our aircraft and the market rates for leases could decline, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nAircraft values and market rates for leases have from time to time experienced sharp decreases due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, oversupply of a specific type of aircraft, decreases in passenger and air cargo demand, increases in fuel costs, inflation, government regulation and increases in interest rates. For example, recent concerns around the 737 MAX aircraft and its grounding have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to lease such aircraft and may result in lower lease rates. We currently have 15 737 MAX aircraft in our owned fleet and 135 of such aircraft in our orderbook to be delivered between 2020 and 2024. Operating leases place the risk of realization of\nresidual values on aircraft lessors because only a portion of the equipment\u2019s value is covered by contractual cash flows at lease inception.\nIn addition to factors linked to the aviation industry generally, many other factors may affect the value of the aircraft that we acquire and market rates for leases, including:\n\u25cf the particular maintenance, damage, operating history and documentary records of the aircraft;\n\u25cf technical problems associated with that particular aircraft model;\n\u25cf the geographical area where the aircraft is based and operates;\n\u25cf the number of operators using that type of aircraft;\n\u25cf aircraft age;\n\u25cf the regulatory authority under which the aircraft is operated;\n\u25cf whether an aircraft is subject to a lease and, if so, whether the lease terms are favorable to the lessor and the creditworthiness of the lessee;\n\u25cf any renegotiation of an existing lease on less favorable terms;\n\u25cf the negotiability of clear title free from mechanics' liens and encumbrances;\n\u25cf any tax, customs, regulatory and other legal requirements that must be satisfied before the aircraft can be purchased, sold or remarketed;\n\u25cf grounding orders or other regulatory action that could prevent or limit utilization of our aircraft;\n\u25cf applicable airworthiness directives and service bulletins;\n\u25cf compatibility of aircraft configurations or specifications with other aircraft owned by operators of that type;\n\u25cf comparative value based on newly manufactured competitive aircraft; and\n\u25cf the availability of spare parts.\nAny decrease in the value of aircraft that we acquire or market rates for leases, which may result from the above factors or other unanticipated factors, would have a negative effect on our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nThe failure of any manufacturer to meet its delivery obligations to us would negatively affect our cash flow and results of operations.\nThe supply of commercial aircraft is dominated by a few airframe manufacturers and a limited number of engine manufacturers. As a result, we are dependent on the success of these manufacturers in remaining financially stable, producing products and related components which meet the airlines' demands and fulfilling any contractual obligations they may have to us.\nWhen the manufacturers fail to respond appropriately to changes in the market environment, bring aircraft to market that do not meet customers' expectations or fail to fulfill any contractual obligations they might have to us, we may experience:\n\u25cf missed or late delivery of aircraft and a potential inability to meet our contractual obligations owed to any of our then lessees, resulting in potential lost or delayed revenues, lower growth rates and strained customer relationships;\n\u25cf an inability to acquire aircraft and related components on terms which will allow us to lease those aircraft to airline customers at a profit, resulting in lower growth rates or a contraction in our aircraft fleet;\n\u25cf a market environment with too many aircraft available, potentially creating downward pressure on demand for the anticipated aircraft in our fleet and reduced market lease rates and sale prices;\n\u25cf reduced demand for a particular manufacturer's product as a result of poor customer support or reputational damage to such manufacturer, creating downward pressure on demand for those aircraft or engines in our fleet and reduced market lease rates and sale prices for those aircraft and engines;\n\u25cf a reduction in our competitiveness due to deep discounting by the aircraft or engine manufacturers, which may lead to reduced market lease rates and aircraft values and may affect our ability to remarket or sell at a profit, or at all, some of the aircraft in our fleet; and\n\u25cf technical or other difficulties with aircraft or engines after delivery that subject aircraft to operating restrictions or groundings, resulting in a decline in value and lease rates of such aircraft and impairing our ability to lease or dispose of such aircraft on favorable terms or at all.\nThere have been recent well-publicized delays by airframe and engine manufacturers in meeting stated deadlines in bringing new aircraft to market. The recent concerns surrounding the 737 MAX aircraft and its grounding have resulted in unexpected delays in delivery from Boeing. We have 135 of such aircraft in our orderbook. In December 2019, Boeing announced the temporary suspension of its production of 737 MAX aircraft effective in January 2020. Over the past two years, we have experienced delays relating to certain aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2020 and 2021 and anticipate additional delivery delays. Our leases contain lessee cancellation clauses related to aircraft delivery delays, typically for aircraft delays greater than one year and our purchase agreements contain similar clauses. If there are manufacturing delays for aircraft for which we have made future lease commitments, some or all of our affected lessees could elect to terminate their lease arrangements with respect to such delayed aircraft. Any such termination could strain our relations with those lessees going forward and would negatively affect our cash flow and results of operations.\nOur aircraft require routine maintenance, and if they are not properly maintained, their value may decline and we may not be able to lease or remarket such aircraft at favorable rates, if at all, which would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to increased maintenance costs for our aircraft associated with a lessee\u2019s failure to properly maintain the aircraft, pay supplemental maintenance rent or comply with end of lease return conditions. If an aircraft is not properly maintained, its market value may decline, which would result in lower revenues from its lease or sale. Under our leases, the relevant lessee is primarily responsible for, among other things, maintaining the aircraft and complying with all governmental requirements applicable to the lessee and the aircraft, including operational, maintenance, government agency oversight, registration requirements, service bulletins issued by aircraft manufacturers and airworthiness directives issued by aviation authorities. We also require some of our lessees to pay us supplemental maintenance rents. Failure of a lessee to perform required maintenance, or comply with the applicable service bulletins and airworthiness directives during the term of a lease could result in a decrease in value of an aircraft, an inability to remarket an aircraft at favorable rates, if at all, or a potential grounding of an aircraft. Maintenance failures by a lessee would also likely require us to incur maintenance and modification costs upon the termination of the applicable lease, which could be substantial, to restore the aircraft to an acceptable condition prior to remarketing or sale. In general, the\ncosts of operating an aircraft, including maintenance and modification expenses, increase with the age of the aircraft. Even if we are entitled to receive supplemental maintenance rents, these rents may not cover the entire cost of actual maintenance required. If any of our aircraft are not subject to a lease, we may be required to bear the entire cost of maintaining that aircraft and performing any required airworthiness directives and service bulletins. Failure by our lessees to meet their obligations to perform significant required scheduled maintenance, pay supplemental maintenance rents or comply with end of lease return conditions or our inability to maintain our aircraft would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nIf we experience events that result in a significant number of our aircraft becoming obsolete, such as through changes in technology, increases in fuel efficiency, and changes in customer preferences, it could negatively impact our ability to lease and remarket those aircraft, result in impairment charges and have a negative effect on our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nAircraft are long-lived assets, requiring long lead times to develop and manufacture, with particular types and models becoming obsolete or less in demand over time when newer, more advanced aircraft are manufactured. Our existing fleet, as well as the aircraft that we have ordered, have exposure to obsolescence, particularly if unanticipated events occur which shorten the life cycle of such aircraft types.\nThese events include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf the introduction of superior aircraft technology;\n\u25cf the introduction of a new line of aircraft or engines, in particular more fuel efficient aircraft;\n\u25cf changes in our airline customers' preferences;\n\u25cf government regulations, including regulations governing noise and emissions and limiting the age of aircraft operating in a jurisdiction;\n\u25cf the costs of operating an aircraft, including maintenance which increases with the age of the aircraft; and\n\u25cf compliance with airworthiness directives.\nThese events may cause the aircraft we own to become outdated or obsolete or oversupplied and therefore less desirable, which could shorten the life cycle for aircraft types in our fleet. As a result, these events could negatively impact our ability to remarket the aircraft, the rates at which we can lease the aircraft, the cost of remarketing such aircraft, and our ability to sell such aircraft on favorable terms, if at all. They may also trigger impairment charges, increase depreciation expense or result in losses related to aircraft asset value guarantees, if we provide such guarantees. Accordingly, obsolescence of aircraft would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nAircraft have limited economic useful lives and depreciate over time and we may be required to record an impairment charge or sell aircraft for a price less than its depreciated book value if market conditions worsen or our customers default on their leases.\nWe depreciate our aircraft for accounting purposes on a straight-line basis to the aircraft\u2019s residual value over its estimated useful life. Our management team also evaluates on a quarterly basis the need to perform an impairment test whenever facts or circumstances indicate a potential impairment has occurred. An assessment is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an aircraft may not be recoverable from their expected future undiscounted net cash flow. We develop the assumptions used in the recoverability assessment based on management's knowledge of, and historical experience in, the aircraft leasing market and aviation industry, as well as from information received from third-party industry sources. Factors considered in developing estimates for this assessment include changes in contracted lease rates, economic conditions, technology, and airline\ndemand for a particular aircraft type. Any of our assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate, which could adversely impact forecasted cash flow. In the event that an aircraft does not meet the recoverability test, the aircraft will be recorded at fair value, resulting in an impairment charge. Deterioration of future lease rates and the residual values of our aircraft could result in impairment charges which could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition. For a description of our impairment policy, see the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies-Flight equipment.\u201d\nIf we record an impairment charge on aircraft, or if we dispose of aircraft for a price that is less than its depreciated book value on our balance sheet, it will reduce our total assets and shareholders' equity. A reduction in our shareholders' equity may negatively impact our ability to comply with covenants in certain of our agreements governing our indebtedness requiring us to maintain a minimum net worth and maximum debt-to-equity ratio, and could result in an event of default under such agreements. For these reasons, our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations would be negatively affected.\nBecause our leases are concentrated in certain geographical regions, we have concentrated exposure to the political, legal and economic risks associated with those regions which could negatively affect our business interests, cash flow and results of operations.\nThrough our lessees and the countries in which they operate, we are exposed to the specific economic and political conditions and associated risks of those jurisdictions. For example, we have large concentrations of lessees in China, and therefore have increased exposure to the economic and political conditions in that country, including the impact of trade disputes and trade barriers. These risks can include regional economic recessions, financial and political emergencies, burdensome local regulations and increased risks of requisition of our aircraft. An adverse political or economic event in any region or country in which our lessees are concentrated or where we have a large number of aircraft could affect the ability of our lessees in that region or country to meet their obligations to us, or expose us to various legal or political risks associated with the affected jurisdictions, all of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nWe are indirectly subject to many of the economic and political risks associated with emerging markets, including China, which could negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nOur business strategy emphasizes leasing aircraft to lessees outside of the United States, including to airlines in emerging market countries. Emerging market countries have less developed economies and infrastructure and are often more vulnerable to economic and geopolitical challenges and may experience significant fluctuations in gross domestic product, interest rates and currency exchange rates, as well as civil disturbances, government instability, nationalization and expropriation of private assets and the imposition of unexpected taxes or other charges by government authorities. The occurrence of any of these events in markets served by our lessees and the resulting economic instability that may arise, particularly if combined with high fuel prices, could negatively affect the value of our aircraft subject to lease in such countries, or the ability of our lessees, which operate in these markets, to meet their lease obligations. As a result, lessees that operate in emerging market countries may be more likely to default than lessees that operate in developed countries. In addition, legal systems in emerging market countries may have different liability standards and be less developed and less predictable than those in advanced economies, which could make it more difficult for us to enforce our legal rights in such countries.\nFurther, demand for aircraft is dependent on passenger and cargo traffic, which in turn is dependent on general business and economic conditions. A decrease in passenger or cargo traffic may have a negative effect on our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations. Weak or negative economic growth in emerging markets may have an indirect effect on the value of the assets that we acquire if airlines and other potential lessees are negatively affected. Economic downturns can affect the values of the assets we purchase, which may have a negative effect on our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nChanges in fuel costs could negatively affect our lessees and by extension the demand for our aircraft which would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nFuel costs represent a major expense to airlines that is not within their control, and fuel prices fluctuate widely depending primarily on international market conditions, geopolitical and environmental events, regulatory changes (including those related to greenhouse gas emissions) and currency exchange rates. If airlines are unable to increase ticket prices to offset fuel price increases, their cash flows will suffer. Political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa has historically generated uncertainty regarding the predictability of the world\u2019s future oil supply, which has led to increased volatility. Fuel costs may rise in the future. Other events can also significantly affect fuel availability and prices, including natural disasters, decisions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries regarding their members\u2019 oil output, and the increase in global demand for fuel from countries such as China.\nHigh fuel costs would likely have a material negative impact on airline profitability. Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry, airlines may not be able to pass on increases in fuel prices to their passengers by increasing fares. If airlines are successful in increasing fares, demand for air travel may be negatively affected. Higher and more volatile fuel prices may also have an impact on consumer confidence and spending, and thus may adversely impact demand for air transportation. In addition, airlines may not be able to manage fuel cost risk by appropriately hedging their exposure to fuel price fluctuations. The profitability and liquidity of those airlines that do hedge their fuel costs can also be adversely affected by swift movements in fuel prices, if such airlines are required to post cash collateral under their hedge agreements. If fuel prices increase, they are likely to cause our lessees to incur higher costs. A sustained period of lower fuel costs may adversely affect regional economies that depend on oil revenue, including those in which certain of our lessees operate. Consequently, these conditions may:\n\u25cf affect our lessees\u2019 ability to make rental and other lease payments;\n\u25cf result in lease restructurings and aircraft repossessions;\n\u25cf increase our costs of maintaining and marketing aircraft;\n\u25cf impair our ability to remarket aircraft or otherwise sell our aircraft on a timely basis at favorable rates; or\n\u25cf reduce the sale proceeds received in the event of an aircraft sale.\nSuch effects would negatively affect demand for our aircraft, which would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nThe appreciation of the U.S. dollar could negatively impact many of our lessees\u2019 ability to honor the terms of their leases and could therefore adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our lessees are exposed to currency risk due to the fact that they earn revenues in their local currencies while a significant portion of their liabilities and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, including their lease payments to us, as well as fuel, debt service, and other expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, less than 3% of our revenues were derived from customers who have their principal place of business in the U.S. While we attempt to minimize our currency and exchange risks by negotiating the designated payment currency in our leases to be U.S. dollars, the ability of our lessees to make lease payments to us in U.S. dollars may be adversely impacted in the event of an appreciating U.S. dollar.\nOur lessees may not be able to increase their revenues sufficiently to offset the impact of exchange rates on their lease payments and other expenses denominated in U.S. dollars. This is particularly true for non-U.S. airlines whose operations are primarily domestic. Currency volatility, particularly as witnessed recently in certain emerging market countries, could impact the ability of some of our customers to meet their contractual obligations in a timely manner. Shifts in foreign exchange rates can be significant, are difficult to predict, and can occur quickly.\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes in the United Kingdom and Europe could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFollowing a referendum in June 2016 in which voters in the United Kingdom, or U.K., approved an exit from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d), the U.K. government initiated a process, often referred to as Brexit, to leave the E.U. On January 31, 2020, the U.K. withdrew from the E.U. The future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. remains uncertain as the U.K. and the E.U. work through the transition period that provides time for them to negotiate the details of their future relationship. The transition period maintains all existing trading arrangements. The transition period is currently expected to end on December 31, 2020, and, if no agreement is reached, the default scenario would be a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the U.K. will leave the E.U. with no agreements in place beyond any temporary arrangements that have or may be put in place by the E.U. or individual E.U. member states, and the U.K. as part of no-deal contingency efforts and those conferred by mutual membership of the World Trade Organization.\nAirlines whose principal place of business is Europe, including the U.K., represented 27.7% and 29.2% of our total revenue for the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The impact of Brexit on us will likely depend on the resulting agreements made by the U.K. and E.U. regarding trade and travel, either during a transitional period or more permanently. These impacts may include increased costs of financing; downward pressure on demand for our aircraft and reduced market lease rates and lease margins; and a higher incidence, in the U.K. in particular and the E.U. generally, of lessee defaults or other events resulting in our lessees\u2019 failing to perform under our lease agreements. Further, many of the structural issues facing the E.U. following the 2008 financial crisis and Brexit remain, and problems could resurface that could affect market conditions, and, possibly, our business, financial results and liquidity, particularly if they lead to the exit of one or more countries from the European Monetary Union, or E.M.U., or the exit of additional countries from the E.U. If one or more countries exits the E.M.U., there would be significant uncertainty with respect to outstanding obligations of counterparties and debtors in any exiting country, whether sovereign or otherwise, and it would likely lead to complex and lengthy disputes and litigation. Additionally, it is possible that political events in Europe could lead to complete dissolution of the E.M.U. or E.U. The partial or full breakup of the E.M.U. or E.U. would be unprecedented and its impact highly uncertain, including with respect to our business.\nAny of the above effects of Brexit, and others that we may not be able to anticipate, could negatively impact our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks, war or armed hostilities between countries or non-state actors, or the fear of such attacks, even if not made directly on the airline industry, could negatively affect lessees and the airline industry, which would negatively affect our cash flow and results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks, war or armed hostilities between countries or non-state actors, or the fear of such events, have historically had a negative impact on the aviation industry and could result in:\n\u25cf higher costs to the airlines due to the increased security measures;\n\u25cf decreased passenger demand and revenue due to the inconvenience of additional security measures or concerns about the safety of flying;\n\u25cf the imposition of ''no-fly zone'' or other restrictions on commercial airline traffic in certain regions;\n\u25cf uncertainty of the price and availability of jet fuel and the cost and practicability of obtaining fuel hedges;\n\u25cf higher financing costs and difficulty in raising the desired amount of proceeds on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u25cf significantly higher costs of aviation insurance coverage for future claims caused by acts of war, terrorism, sabotage, hijacking and other similar perils, or the unavailability of certain types of insurance;\n\u25cf inability of airlines to reduce their operating costs and conserve financial resources, taking into account the increased costs incurred as a consequence of such events;\n\u25cf special charges recognized by some operators, such as those related to the impairment of aircraft and engines and other long-lived assets stemming from the grounding of aircraft as a result of terrorist attacks, economic conditions and airline reorganizations; and\n\u25cf an airline becoming insolvent and/or ceasing operations.\nFor example, as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States and subsequent terrorist attacks abroad, notably in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Europe, increased security restrictions were implemented on air travel, costs for aircraft insurance and security measures increased, passenger and cargo demand for air travel decreased, and operators faced difficulties in acquiring war risk and other insurance at reasonable costs. Further, international sanctions against Russia and other countries, uncertainty regarding tensions between the United States and North Korea, the United States and Russia and the United States and Iran, the situations in Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Egypt and Syria, the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, political instability in the Middle East and North Africa, the territorial disputes between Japan and China, the recent tensions in the South China Sea and additional international hostilities could lead to further instability in these regions.\nTerrorist attacks, war or armed hostilities between countries or non-state actors, large protests or government instability, or the fear of such events, could adversely affect the aviation industry and the financial condition and liquidity of our lessees, as well as aircraft values and rental rates. In addition, such events may cause certain aviation insurance to become available only at significantly increased premiums or with reduced amounts of coverage insufficient to comply with the current requirements of aircraft lenders and lessors or by applicable government regulations, or not to be available at all. Although some governments provide for limited coverage under government programs for specified types of aviation insurance, these programs may not be available at the relevant time or governments may not pay under these programs in a timely fashion.\nSuch events are likely to cause our lessees to incur higher costs and to generate lower revenues, which could result in a material adverse effect on their financial condition and liquidity, including their ability to make rental and other lease payments to us or to obtain the types and amounts of insurance we require. This in turn could lead to aircraft groundings or additional lease restructurings and repossessions, increase our cost of remarketing or selling aircraft, impair our ability to remarket or otherwise dispose of aircraft on favorable terms or at all, or reduce the proceeds we receive for our aircraft in a disposition.\nEpidemic diseases have hindered airline travel in the past and the current concern surrounding the coronavirus may continue to hinder travel, primarily affecting China and the surrounding region. The threat or realization of epidemic diseases, such as the coronavirus, and the resulting decreased demand for aircraft travel could negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nEpidemic diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, bird flu, swine flu, the Zika virus, Ebola or other pandemic diseases have on occasion negatively affected passenger demand for air travel in recent years. The current concerns surrounding the coronavirus may continue to have an adverse effect on travel, primarily affecting China and the surrounding region. These epidemic diseases and other pandemic diseases, or the fear of such events, could provoke responses, including government-imposed travel restrictions, which could negatively affect passenger demand for air travel and the financial condition of the aviation industry. For example, we cannot currently predict the impact that the current coronavirus epidemic will have on air travel and how that may impact the ability of our lessees to satisfy their payment obligations to us. The consequences of these events may reduce the demand for aircraft and/or impair our lessees\u2019 ability to satisfy their lease payment obligations to us, which in turn would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nNatural disasters and other natural phenomena may disrupt air travel and reduce the demand for aircraft which would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nAir travel can be disrupted, sometimes severely, by the occurrence of natural disasters and other natural phenomena. A natural disaster or other natural phenomena could cause disruption to air travel and could result in a reduced demand for aircraft and/or impair our lessees' ability to satisfy their lease payment obligations to us, which in turn would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nCompetition from other aircraft lessors, including lessors with greater resources or a lower cost of capital than ours, could negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nThe aircraft leasing industry is highly competitive. Some of our competitors may have greater resources or a lower cost of capital than ours or may provide certain financial services, maintenance services or other inducements to potential lessees or buyers that we cannot provide; accordingly, they may be able to compete more effectively in one or more of the markets we conduct business in. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances, lower investment return expectations or different risk or residual value assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, establish more relationships, bid more aggressively on aviation assets available for sale and offer lower lease rates or sale prices than we can.\nOur competition is primarily comprised of major aircraft leasing companies, but we may also encounter competition from other entities in the acquisition, leasing and selling of aircraft such as:\n\u25cf airlines;\n\u25cf private equity and other investment funds;\n\u25cf aircraft manufacturers;\n\u25cf financial institutions;\n\u25cf special purpose vehicles formed for the purpose of acquiring, leasing and selling aircraft;\n\u25cf aircraft brokers;\n\u25cf public and private partnerships, investors and funds; and\n\u25cf other aircraft leasing companies that we do not currently consider our major competitors.\nAdditionally, the barriers to entry in the aircraft acquisition and leasing market are comparatively low, and new entrants with private equity, hedge fund, Asian bank or other funding sources appear from time to time.\nCompetition for a leasing transaction is based principally upon lease rates, delivery dates, lease terms, reputation, management expertise, aircraft condition, specifications and configuration and the availability of the types of aircraft necessary to meet the needs of the customer. Competition when purchasing or selling used aircraft is based principally on the price, and where applicable the terms of the lease to which an aircraft is subject and the creditworthiness of the lessee. We will not always be able to compete successfully with our competitors, which could negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into profitable leases for any aircraft acquired, which failure to do so would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into profitable leases upon the acquisition of the aircraft we purchase in the future. Our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations depend upon our management team\u2019s\njudgment and ability to evaluate the ability of lessees and other counterparties to perform their obligations to us and to negotiate transaction documents. We cannot assure you that our management team will be able to perform such functions in a manner that will achieve our investment objectives, which would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nOur business model depends on our ability to continually lease and remarket our aircraft, in particular within the passenger airline industry, and finally sell our aircraft, and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms, which would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nOur business model depends on our ability to continually lease and remarket our aircraft, in particular within the passenger airline industry, and finally sell our aircraft in order to generate sufficient revenues to finance our growth and operations, pay our debt service obligations and meet our other corporate and contractual obligations. Our ability to lease and remarket our aircraft will depend on general market and competitive conditions at the time the leases are entered into and expire. The financial condition of the passenger airline industry is of particular importance to us because our aircraft are primarily leased to passenger airlines and we plan to continue to lease our aircraft to passenger airlines. If we are not able to lease or remarket an aircraft or to do so on favorable terms, we may be required to attempt to sell the aircraft to provide funds for our debt service obligations or operating expenses. Our ability to lease, remarket or sell the aircraft on favorable terms or without significant off-lease time and costs could be negatively affected by depressed conditions in the aviation industry, negative airline passenger traffic trends, government and environmental regulations, increased operating costs including the price and availability of jet fuel, credit deterioration of a lessee, the effects of terrorism, war, natural disasters and/or epidemic diseases on the aviation industry, declines in the values of aircraft, and various other general market and competitive conditions and factors, including those described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report, many of which are outside of our control. If we are unable to lease and remarket our aircraft on favorable terms, or at all, our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations would be negatively impacted.\nFrom time to time, the aircraft industry has experienced periods of oversupply during which lease rates and aircraft values have declined, and any future oversupply could negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nThe aircraft leasing business has experienced periods of aircraft oversupply following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis. The oversupply of a specific type of aircraft is likely to depress the lease rates for, and the value of, that type of aircraft, including upon sale. Further, over recent years, the airline industry has committed to a significant number of aircraft deliveries through order placements with manufacturers, and in response, aircraft manufacturers have generally raised their production output. Increases in the production levels could result in an oversupply of relatively new aircraft if growth in airline traffic does not meet airline industry expectations. Additionally, if overall lending capacity to purchasers of aircraft does not increase in line with the increased aircraft production levels, the cost of lending or ability to obtain debt to finance aircraft purchases could be negatively affected.\nThe supply and demand for aircraft is affected by various cyclical and non-cyclical factors that are outside of our control, including:\n\u25cf passenger and air cargo demand;\n\u25cf airline operating costs, including fuel costs;\n\u25cf general economic conditions;\n\u25cf technical problems associated with particular aircraft models;\n\u25cf geopolitical events, including war, prolonged armed conflict and acts of terrorism;\n\u25cf outbreaks of communicable diseases and natural disasters;\n\u25cf governmental regulation, including new airworthiness directives, statutory limits on the age of aircraft, and restrictions in certain jurisdictions on the age of aircraft for import, climate change initiatives and environmental regulation, aircraft noise regulations and other factors leading to reduced demand for, or obsolescence of, aircraft models;\n\u25cf interest and foreign exchange rates;\n\u25cf tariffs and other restrictions on trade;\n\u25cf the availability of credit;\n\u25cf airline restructurings and bankruptcies;\n\u25cf airline fleet planning that reduces capacity or changes the type of aircraft in demand;\n\u25cf accuracy of estimates relating to future supply and demand made by manufacturers and lessees;\n\u25cf manufacturer production levels and technological innovation;\n\u25cf discounting by manufacturers on aircraft types nearing end of production;\n\u25cf manufacturers merging or exiting the industry or ceasing to produce aircraft types;\n\u25cf new-entrant manufacturers producing additional aircraft models, or existing manufacturers producing new engine models or new aircraft models, in competition with existing aircraft models;\n\u25cf retirement and obsolescence of aircraft models;\n\u25cf reintroduction into service of aircraft previously in storage; and\n\u25cf airport and air traffic control infrastructure constraints.\nIn addition, operating lessors may be sold or merged with other entities or restructured. These types of transactions may call for a reduction in the fleet of the new entity, which could increase supply levels of used and older aircraft in the market. Furthermore, recent and future political developments, including the current trade disputes between the U.S. and China and other developments as a result of the policies of the current U.S. presidential administration or policies pursued in Europe, could result in increased regulation of trade, which could adversely impact demand for aircraft.\nAny of these factors may produce sharp and prolonged decreases in aircraft lease rates and values. They may have a negative effect on our ability to lease or remarket the aircraft in our fleet or in our order book on favorable terms or at all. Any of these factors could negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nLessee defaults or reorganizations could result in significant costs to us and could negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, an airline may seek to reorganize and seek protection from creditors under their local laws or may go into liquidation. Based on historical rates of airline defaults and bankruptcies, we expect some of our lessees may default on their lease obligations or file for bankruptcy or otherwise seek protection from creditors under local laws. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, lessee defaults and reorganizations. Lessee defaults and reorganizations may result in us incurring significant additional costs, including legal and other expenses associated with court or other governmental proceedings, such as the cost of posting security bonds or letters of credit necessary to effect repossession of the aircraft, particularly if the lessee is contesting the proceedings or is in bankruptcy. In addition, during\nany such proceedings the relevant aircraft may not be generating revenue. We could also incur substantial maintenance, refurbishment or repair costs if a defaulting lessee fails to pay such costs and where such maintenance, refurbishment or repairs are necessary to put the aircraft in suitable condition for remarketing or sale. We may also incur storage costs associated with any aircraft that we repossess and are unable to place immediately with another lessee. Even if we are able to immediately place a repossessed aircraft with another lessee, we may not be able to do so at a similar or favorable lease rate. It may also be necessary to pay off liens, taxes and other governmental charges on the aircraft to obtain clear possession and to remarket the aircraft effectively, including, in some cases, liens that the lessee might have incurred in connection with the operation of its other aircraft. We could also incur other costs in connection with the physical possession of the aircraft.\nWe may suffer other negative consequences as a result of a lessee default, the related termination of the lease and the repossession of the related aircraft. Reorganizations or liquidations by airlines or abandonment of aircraft by airlines in bankruptcy proceedings may depress aircraft values and aircraft lease rates, and additional grounded aircraft and lower market values would adversely affect our ability to sell our aircraft or lease or remarket our aircraft at favorable rates or at all. It is likely that our rights upon a lessee default will vary significantly depending upon the jurisdiction and the applicable law, including the need to obtain a court order for repossession of the aircraft and/or consents for deregistration or export of the aircraft. We anticipate that when a defaulting lessee is in bankruptcy, protective administration, insolvency or similar proceedings, additional limitations may apply. Certain jurisdictions give rights to the trustee in bankruptcy or a similar officer to assume or reject the lease or to assign it to a third party, or entitle the lessee or another third party to retain possession of the aircraft without paying lease rentals or performing all or some of the obligations under the relevant lease. There can be no assurance that jurisdictions that have adopted the Cape Town Convention, which provides for uniformity and certainty for repossession of aircraft, will enforce it as written. In addition, certain of our lessees are owned, in whole or in part, by government-related entities, which could complicate our efforts to repossess our aircraft in that government\u2019s jurisdiction. Accordingly, we may be delayed in, or prevented from, enforcing certain of our rights under a lease and in remarketing the affected aircraft.\nIf we repossess an aircraft, we may not necessarily be able to export or deregister and profitably redeploy the aircraft. An aircraft cannot be registered in two countries at the same time. Before an aviation authority will register an aircraft that has previously been registered in another country, it must receive confirmation that the aircraft has been deregistered by that country\u2019s aviation authority. In order to deregister an aircraft, the lessee must comply with applicable laws and regulations, and the relevant governmental authority must enforce these laws and regulations. For instance, where a lessee or other operator flies only domestic routes in the jurisdiction in which the aircraft is registered, repossession may be more difficult, especially if the jurisdiction permits the lessee or the other operator to resist deregistration. We may also incur significant costs in retrieving or recreating aircraft records required for registration of the aircraft, and in obtaining a certificate of airworthiness for an aircraft. If, upon a lessee default, we incur significant costs in connection with repossessing our aircraft, are delayed in repossessing our aircraft or are unable to obtain possession of our aircraft as a result of lessee defaults, our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nIf our lessees fail to discharge aircraft liens, we may be obligated to pay the aircraft liens, which would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nIn the normal course of their business, our lessees are likely to incur aircraft liens that secure the payment of airport fees and taxes, customs duties, air navigation charges, including charges imposed by Eurocontrol, the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation, landing charges, crew wages, salvage or other liens that may attach to our aircraft. These liens may secure substantial sums that may, in certain jurisdictions or for certain types of liens, particularly liens on entire fleets of aircraft, exceed the value of the particular aircraft to which the liens have attached. Aircraft may also be subject to mechanics\u2019 liens as a result of routine maintenance performed by third parties on behalf of our lessees. Although we anticipate that the financial obligations relating to these liens are the responsibility of our lessees, if they fail to fulfill such obligations, the liens may attach to our aircraft and ultimately become our responsibility. In some jurisdictions, aircraft liens may give the holder thereof the right to detain or, in limited cases, sell or cause the forfeiture of the aircraft.\nUntil they are discharged, these liens could impair our ability to repossess, remarket or sell our aircraft. Our lessees may not comply with the anticipated obligations under their leases to discharge aircraft liens arising during the terms of the leases. If they do not, we may find it necessary to pay the claims secured by such aircraft liens in order to repossess the aircraft. If we are required to make such payments or if we are unable to take possession of our aircraft subject to a lien in a timely and cost-effective manner, it could negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the success of our lessees and defaults on leases or reorganizations by one or more of our significant airline customers could have a negative effect on our cash flow and earnings.\nThe airline industry is cyclical, economically sensitive and highly competitive. Our lessees are affected by a number of factors over which we and they have limited control, including:\n\u25cf increased competition;\n\u25cf passenger and air cargo rates;\n\u25cf passenger air travel and air cargo demand;\n\u25cf fuel prices and shortages;\n\u25cf labor difficulties, including pilot shortages or labor actions;\n\u25cf increases in other operating costs, such as increased insurance costs;\n\u25cf availability of financing, including availability of governmental support;\n\u25cf economic conditions, inflation, and currency fluctuations in the countries and regions in which the lessees operate;\n\u25cf recessions;\n\u25cf political or economic instability, including as a result of terrorist activities, changes in national policy or the imposition of new trade barriers;\n\u25cf governmental regulation and associated fees affecting the air transportation business;\n\u25cf cyber risks;\n\u25cf aircraft accidents, in particular a loss if the aircraft is damaged or destroyed by an event specifically excluded from insurance policies such as dirty bombs, bio hazardous materials and electromagnetic pulsing; and\n\u25cf other events negatively affecting the world or regional trading markets, such as natural disasters or health concerns.\nOur lessees' abilities to react to and cope with the volatile competitive environment in which they operate, as well as our own competitive environment, will likely affect our revenues and income. Further, most of our airline customers do not have investment-grade credit profiles, and we may not correctly assess the credit risk of a lessee. We anticipate that some of our lessees will experience a weakened financial condition or suffer liquidity problems.\nAny of the above events could lead to a lessee experiencing difficulties in performing under the terms of our lease agreement, which could result in the lessee seeking relief under some of the terms of our lease agreement, or it could result in us electing to repossess the aircraft.\nIt is likely that restructurings and/or repossessions with some of our lessees will occur in the future. In the event that a lessee defaults under a lease, any security deposit paid or letter of credit provided by the lessee may not be sufficient to cover the lessee\u2019s outstanding or unpaid lease obligations and required maintenance and transition expenses. As a result, terms and conditions of possible lease restructurings or rescheduling may result in a significant reduction of lease revenue, which may negatively affect our financial results. If any request for payment restructuring or rescheduling is made and granted, reduced or deferred rental payments may be payable over all or some part of the remaining term of the lease. The terms of any revised payment schedules may be unfavorable and such payments may not be made. Our default levels would likely increase over time if economic conditions deteriorate.\nDelayed, missed or reduced rental payments from one or more lessees that lease a significant number of our aircraft would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations. For instance, the loss of one or more of our significant airline customers or their inability to make operating lease payments could result in a breach of the covenants contained in any of our long-term debt facilities or make it more difficult for us to pay the interest or maturity on our outstanding debt, possibly resulting in defaults and accelerated payments. If we, in the exercise of our remedies under a lease, repossess an aircraft, we may not receive all or any of the past-due or deferred payments and we may not be able to remarket the aircraft promptly or at favorable rates, if at all. Also, if a lessee seeks bankruptcy or other insolvency protection, we may not recover any of our claims or damages against the lessee.\nAccordingly, if lessees of a significant number of our aircraft fail to perform as expected and we decide to restructure or reschedule our leases. or if lessees of a significant number of our aircraft seek bankruptcy or other insolvency protection, it would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nCreditors of any subsidiaries we form for purposes of financing will have priority over our stockholders in the event of a distribution of such subsidiaries\u2019 assets.\nSome of the aircraft we acquire are held in special-purpose, bankruptcy-remote subsidiaries of the Company. Liens on those assets will be held by a collateral agent for the benefit of the lenders under the respective facility. In addition, funds generated from the lease of aircraft generally are applied first to amounts due to lenders, with certain exceptions. Creditors of our subsidiaries will have priority over us, our stockholders and our creditors relating to debt that is not guaranteed or secured by our subsidiaries or their assets in any distribution of any such subsidiaries' assets in a liquidation, reorganization or otherwise.\nCertain of our subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to make distributions to us which would negatively affect our financial condition and cash flow.\nThe subsidiaries that hold our aircraft are legally distinct from us, and some of these subsidiaries are restricted from paying dividends or otherwise making funds available to us pursuant to agreements governing our indebtedness. Some of our principal debt facilities have financial covenants. If we are unable to comply with these covenants, then the amounts outstanding under these facilities may become immediately due and payable, cash generated by our subsidiaries affected by these facilities may be unavailable to us and/or we may be unable to draw additional amounts under these facilities. The events that could cause some of our subsidiaries not to be in compliance with their loan agreements, such as a lessee default, may be beyond our control, but they nevertheless could have a substantial negative impact on the amount of our cash flow available to fund working capital, make aircraft investments and satisfy other cash needs. For these reasons our financial condition and cash flow would be negatively affected. For a description of the operating and financial restrictions in our debt facilities, see the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nFailure to obtain certain required licenses, consents and approvals could negatively affect our ability to remarket or sell aircraft, which would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nAirlines are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the jurisdictions in which they are registered and in which they operate. As a result, we expect that certain aspects of our leases will require licenses, consents or approvals, including consents from governmental or regulatory authorities for certain payments under our leases and for the import, export or deregistration of the aircraft. Subsequent changes in applicable law or administrative practice may increase such requirements and governmental consent, once given, could be withdrawn. Furthermore, consents needed in connection with the future remarketing or sale of an aircraft may not be forthcoming. Any of these events could negatively affect our ability to remarket or sell aircraft, which would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nOur aircraft may not at all times be adequately insured and our lessees may fail to fulfill their respective indemnity obligations, which in either case, could negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nWe do not directly control the operation of any aircraft we acquire. Nevertheless, because we hold title, directly or indirectly, to such aircraft, we could be sued or held strictly liable for losses resulting from the operation of such aircraft, or may be held liable for those losses on other legal theories, in certain jurisdictions around the world, or claims may be made against us as the owner of an aircraft requiring us to expend resources in our defense. We require our lessees to obtain specified levels of insurance and indemnify us for, and insure against, liabilities arising out of their use and operation of the aircraft. Lessees are also required to maintain public liability, property damage and all risk hull and war risk insurance on the aircraft at agreed upon levels. Some lessees may fail to maintain adequate insurance coverage during a lease term, which, although in contravention of the lease terms, would necessitate our taking some corrective action such as terminating the lease or securing insurance for the aircraft, either of which could negatively affect our financial results. Moreover, even if our lessees retain specified levels of insurance, and indemnify us for, and insure against, liabilities arising out of their use and operation of the aircraft, we cannot assure you that we will not have any liability.\nIn addition, there are certain risks or liabilities that our lessees may face, for which insurers may be unwilling to provide coverage or the cost to obtain such coverage may be prohibitively expensive. For example, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, non-government aviation insurers significantly reduced the amount of insurance coverage available for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war, dirty bombs, bio-hazardous materials, electromagnetic pulsing or similar events. At the same time, they significantly increased the premiums for such third-party war risk and terrorism liability insurance and coverage in general. Accordingly, we anticipate that our lessees\u2019 insurance or other coverage may not be sufficient to cover all claims that could or will be asserted against us arising from the operation of our aircraft by our lessees. Inadequate insurance coverage or default by lessees in fulfilling their indemnification or insurance obligations will reduce the proceeds that would be received by us in the event that we are sued and are required to make payments to claimants. Moreover, our lessees\u2019 insurance coverage is dependent on the financial condition of insurance companies, which might not be able to pay claims. A reduction in insurance proceeds otherwise payable to us as a result of any of these factors could negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nThe death, incapacity or departure of key officers could harm our business and negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nWe believe our senior management\u2019s reputation and relationships with lessees, manufacturers, buyers and financiers of aircraft are a critical element to the success of our business. We depend on the diligence, skill and network of business contacts of our management team. We believe there are only a limited number of available qualified executives in the aircraft industry, and we therefore have encountered, and will likely continue to encounter, intense competition for qualified employees from other companies in our industry. Our future success will depend, to a significant extent, upon the continued service of our senior management personnel, particularly: Mr. Udvar-H\u00e1zy, our founder, and Executive Chairman of the Board; Mr. Plueger, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and our other senior officers, each of whose services are critical to the success of our business strategies. We do not have employment\nagreements with Mr. Udvar-H\u00e1zy or Mr. Plueger. If we were to lose the services of any of the members of our senior management team, it could negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nChanges in banks\u2019 inter-bank lending rate reporting practices or the method pursuant to which LIBOR is determined may adversely affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and other indices which are deemed \u201cbenchmarks\u201d are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, has announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. That announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Moreover, it is possible that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified prior to 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate and a reformed Sterling Overnight Index Average, respectively, which are currently intended to serve as alternative reference rates to LIBOR. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be implemented in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates or other reforms may adversely affect our indebtedness that bear interest at a floating rate determined by reference to LIBOR and any of our equity securities that accrue dividends at a floating rate determined by reference to LIBOR.\nAny of the above changes or any other consequential changes to LIBOR or any other \u201cbenchmark,\u201d or any further uncertainty in relation to the timing and manner of implementation of such changes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations. In addition, any of these alternative methods may result in interest and dividend payments that do not correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on our indebtedness or equity securities, as applicable, if three-month LIBOR was available in its current form. We currently have $1.6 billion of outstanding debt that bears interest at a floating rate and uses LIBOR as the applicable reference rate and 10.0 million shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding that will in the future accrue dividends at a floating rate determined by reference to LIBOR, if available. If the rate used to calculate interest on our outstanding floating rate debt that currently uses LIBOR and our Series A Preferred Stock were to increase by 1.0% either as a result of an increase in LIBOR or the result of the use of an alternative reference rate determined under the fallback provisions in the applicable debt if LIBOR is discontinued, we would expect to incur additional interest expense on such indebtedness as of December 31, 2019 of approximately $15.9 million on an annualized basis. Further, if LIBOR is discontinued and there is no acceptable alternative reference rate, some of our floating rate debt, including our senior unsecured notes issued under our Medium-Term Note Program, may effectively become fixed rate debt. As a result, the cost of this debt would increase to us if and as interest rates decreased.\nConflicts of interest may arise between us and clients who will utilize our fleet management services, which could negatively affect our business interests, cash flow and results of operations.\nConflicts of interest may arise between us and third-party aircraft owners, financiers and operating lessors who hire us to perform fleet management services such as leasing, remarketing, lease management and sales services. These conflicts may arise because services we anticipate providing for these clients are also services we will provide for our own fleet, including the placement of aircraft with lessees. Our current fleet management services agreements provide, and we expect our future fleet management services agreements to provide, that we will use our reasonable commercial efforts in providing services, but, to the extent that we are in competition with the client for leasing opportunities, we will give priority to our own fleet. Nevertheless, despite these contractual waivers, competing with our fleet management clients in practice may result in strained relationships with them, which could negatively affect our business interests, cash flow and results of operations.\nWe currently have, and may in the future acquire, minority interests in entities that own and lease aircraft, with the intent that we would serve as the manager of the aircraft owned or managed by such entities; however, entering into such relationships poses risks in that we most likely would not have complete control over the enterprise, and our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations could be negatively affected if we encounter disputes, deadlock or other conflicts of interest with our investment partners.\nWe own non-controlling interests in entities that invest in commercial aircraft and lease them to airlines around the world and/or facilitate the sale and continued management of aircraft assets to investors. Additionally, we may on occasion acquire interests in similar entities controlled or owned by third parties in order to take advantage of favorable financing opportunities or tax benefits, to share capital and/or operating risk, and/or to earn fleet management fees. Such interests involve significant risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership, including that:\n\u2022 we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment;\n\u2022 the investment may divert management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u2022 our investment partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives, including the timing, terms and strategies for any investments;\n\u2022 our investment partners might fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their other obligations; and\n\u2022 our investment partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues, particularly if aircraft owned by the applicable investment entity are being marketed for lease or sale at a time when we also have comparable aircraft available for lease or sale.\nAlthough we currently serve as the manager for the aircraft owned by these existing entities and we anticipate that we would serve as the manager of any such future entities, it has been our management\u2019s experience that the agreements governing these entities will typically provide the non-managing investment partner certain veto rights over various significant actions, including the right to remove us as the manager under certain circumstances. If we were to be removed as the manager from a managed fleet portfolio that generates significant management fees, our financial results could be materially and negatively affected. In addition, if we were unable to resolve a dispute with a significant investment partner that retains material managerial veto rights, we might reach an impasse that could require us to dissolve the investment entity at a time and in a manner that could result in our losing some or all of our original investment in such entity, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nThe effects of various environmental regulations and concerns may negatively affect the airline industry, which may in turn cause lessees to default on their lease payment obligations to us which would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nThe airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water, aircraft noise, the management of hazardous substances, oils and waste materials and other regulations affecting aircraft operations. Governmental regulations regarding aircraft and engine noise and emissions levels apply based on where the relevant aircraft is registered and operated. For example, jurisdictions throughout the world have adopted noise regulations which require all aircraft to comply with noise level standards. In addition, the U.S. and the International Civil Aviation Organization (the \u201cICAO\u201d) have specific standards for noise levels which apply to engines manufactured or certified on or after January 1, 2006. Currently, U.S. regulations would not require any phase-out of aircraft that comply with the older standards applicable to engines manufactured or certified prior to January 1, 2006, but the E.U. has established a framework for the imposition of operating limitations on aircraft that do not comply with the new standards. ICAO has also adopted newer, more stringent noise level standards to apply to new airplane designs with a maximum takeoff weight of 55,000 kg or more submitted for certification on or after December 31, 2017; or with a maximum takeoff weight of less than 55,000 kg submitted for certification on or after December 31, 2020. Additionally, the U.S. has adopted new noise regulations, effective November 3, 2017, to harmonize with the new ICAO standards. These regulations could limit the economic life of the aircraft and engines, reduce their value, limit our ability to lease or\nsell the non-compliant aircraft and engines or, if engine modifications are permitted, require us to make significant additional investments in the aircraft and engines to make them compliant.\nIn addition to more stringent noise restrictions, the U.S. and other jurisdictions have imposed more stringent limits on nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide emissions from engines, consistent with current ICAO standards. These limits generally apply only to engines manufactured after 1999. Because aircraft engines are replaced from time to time in the normal course, it is likely that the number of such replacements would increase over time.\nAs of 2012, the E.U. has included aviation-related emissions in its greenhouse gas Emissions Trading System (the \u201cETS\u201d). The potential impact on costs of the E.U. ETS and the ICAO's new Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (known as \u201cCORSIA\u201d), which calls for a carbon offsetting measure to help the aviation industry meet its goal of carbon neutral growth after 2020, has not been completely identified. Schemes to reduce emissions such as the E.U. ETS and CORSIA could favor younger, more fuel efficient aircraft since they generally produce lower levels of emissions per passenger, which could adversely affect our ability to remarket or otherwise dispose of less efficient aircraft on a timely basis, at favorable terms, or at all. Concerns over global warming also could result in more stringent limitations on the operation of aircraft. Any of these regulations could limit the economic life of the aircraft and engines, reduce their value, limit our ability to lease or sell the compliant aircraft and engines or, if engine modifications are permitted, require us to make significant additional investments in the aircraft and engines to make them compliant, which would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations. Further, compliance with current or future regulations, taxes or duties imposed to deal with environmental concerns could cause lessees to incur higher costs and to generate lower net revenues, resulting in a negative impact on their financial conditions. For example, the United Kingdom doubled its air passenger duties in 2007, in recognition of the environmental costs of air travel. Consequently, such compliance may affect lessees\u2019 ability to make rental and other lease payments and reduce the value we receive for the aircraft upon any disposition, which would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nThe airline industry has come under increased scrutiny by the press, the public and investors regarding the impact of air travel on the environment, including emissions to the air, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water, aircraft noise, the management of hazardous substances, oils and waste materials and other environmental impacts related to aircraft operations. If such scrutiny results in reduced air travel, it may affect demand for our aircraft, lessees\u2019 ability to make rental and other lease payments and reduce the value we receive for our aircraft upon any disposition, which would negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions and may become subject to a wide range of income and other taxes which would negatively affect our cash flow and results of operations.\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions and may become subject to a wide range of income and other taxes. If we are unable to execute our business in jurisdictions with favorable tax treatment, our operations may be subject to significant income and other taxes.\nMoreover, as our aircraft are operated by our lessees in multiple states and foreign jurisdictions, we may have nexus or taxable presence as a result of our aircraft landings in various states or foreign jurisdictions. Such landings may result in us being subject to various foreign, state and local taxes in such states or foreign jurisdictions. For these reasons our cash flow and results of operations would be negatively affected.\nChanges in tax laws could negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nTax laws and the practice of the local tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we reside, in which we conduct activities or operations, or where our aircraft or lessees of our aircraft are located may change in the future. Such changes in tax law or practice could result in additional taxes for us or our shareholders.\nWe are subject to various risks and requirements associated with transacting business in foreign countries which would negatively affect our cash flow and results of operations.\nOur international operations expose us to trade and economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the United States or other governments or organizations. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, State and Treasury and other foreign agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export control laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other federal statutes and regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and those established by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), and, increasingly, similar or more restrictive foreign laws, rules and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act (\u201cUKBA\u201d), which may also apply to us. Under these laws and regulations, the government may require export licenses, may impose restrictions that would require modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities, and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs. Any failure to implement changes consistent with such restrictions may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions. A violation of these laws or regulations could negatively impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nSanctions targeting Cuba, Syria and North Korea prohibit most activity in those countries or with the governments of those countries, including aircraft sale and leasing transactions. Further, events in Ukraine and Crimea have resulted in the E.U. and the United States imposing targeted sanctions on Russia and Ukraine and certain businesses, sectors and individuals in Russia and Ukraine, including the airline industry. For instance, the United States has imposed restrictions prohibiting U.S. individuals and entities, including their foreign branches, from providing financial services or assistance in the form of new equity or debt with certain maturities to specified Russian individuals and entities and any entity in which such listed persons hold a 50 percent or greater interest, or from engaging in any dealing with other specified Russian and Ukrainian individuals and any entity in which such listed persons hold a 50 percent or greater interest. Most transactions with the Crimea region of Ukraine, or involving a Crimean entity or individual are also prohibited under the current Russia/Ukraine sanctions program. Additionally, the E.U. has enacted similar restrictions in which citizens of E.U. member states and corporations domiciled in E.U. member states are prohibited from dealing with financial instruments having a maturity greater than 30 days with certain Russian entities. Russia has imposed its own sanctions on certain individuals in the United States and may impose other sanctions on the United States and the E.U. and/or certain businesses or individuals from these regions. We cannot assure you that the current sanctions or any further sanctions imposed by the E.U., the United States or other international interests will not adversely affect our operations.\nIn 2016, the United States and E.U. lifted certain nuclear-related secondary sanctions as provided by the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (\u201cJCPOA\u201d) with Iran. Among other things, the JCPOA resulted in a favorable licensing policy for the sale or lease of civil passenger aircraft to most Iranian airlines. The United States announced its withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018, and such licenses are no longer available for U.S. entities or for aircraft containing more than 10 percent controlled U.S. content. Most transactions with Iran, the government of Iran, any person in Iran, or with a business partner in a third country where the transaction is intended to benefit Iran are prohibited, including aircraft sale and lease transactions.\nWe have in place training programs for our employees with respect to FCPA, OFAC, UKBA, export controls and similar laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that our employees, consultants, sales agents, or associates will not engage in unlawful conduct for which we may be held responsible, nor can there be assurance that our business partners will not engage in conduct which could materially affect their ability to perform their contractual obligations to us or even result in our being held liable for such conduct. There can be no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future, particularly as the scope of certain laws may be unclear and may be subject to change. Violations of the FCPA, OFAC, UKBA and other export control regulations, and similar laws and regulations may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our cash flow and results of operations.\nA cyberattack that bypasses our information technology, or IT, security systems or the IT security systems of our third-party providers, causing an IT security breach, may lead to a disruption of our IT systems and the loss of business information which may hinder our ability to conduct our business effectively and may result in lost revenues and additional costs.\nParts of our business depend on the secure operation of our IT systems and the IT systems of our third-party providers to manage, process, store, and transmit information associated with aircraft leasing. We have, from time to time, experienced threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks. A cyberattack that bypasses our IT security systems or the IT security systems of our third-party providers, causing an IT security breach, could adversely impact our daily operations and lead to the loss of sensitive information, including our own proprietary information and that of our customers, suppliers and employees. Such losses could harm our reputation and result in competitive disadvantages, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, lost revenues, additional costs and liabilities. While we devote substantial resources to maintaining adequate levels of cyber-security, our resources and technical sophistication may not be adequate to prevent all types of cyberattacks.\nRisks associated with data privacy issues, including evolving laws and regulations and associated compliance efforts, may adversely impact our business.\nThe laws and regulations relating to personal data constantly evolve, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new measures addressing data privacy and processing (including collection, storage, transfer, disposal, disclosure, security and use) of personal data. Moreover, the interpretation and application of many existing or recently enacted privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the U.S., Europe (including, but not limited, to the E.U.\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act) and elsewhere are uncertain and fluid, and it is possible that such laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices. Evolving compliance and operational requirements under the privacy laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate have become increasingly burdensome and complex, and are likely to continue to be so for the foreseeable future. Privacy-related claims or lawsuits initiated by governmental bodies, customers or other third parties, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly regulatory proceedings, litigation, penalties and fines, or require us to change our business practices, sometimes in expensive ways, or other potential liabilities. Additionally, any actual or perceived breach of such laws or regulations may subject us to claims and may lead to administrative, civil, or criminal liability, as well as reputational harm to us and our employees.\nMaterial damage to, or interruptions in, our IT systems or the IT systems of our third-party providers as a result of external factors, staffing shortages and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe depend largely upon our IT systems and the IT systems of our third-party providers in the conduct of all aspects of our operations. Such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, fire and natural disasters. Damage or interruption to our IT systems may require a significant investment to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. Any material interruptions or failures in our information systems may have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nThe price of our Class A common stock historically has been volatile. This volatility may negatively affect the price of our Class A common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s stock continues to experience substantial price volatility. This volatility may negatively affect the price of our Class A common stock at any point in time. Our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including:\n\u25cf variations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u25cf actual or perceived reduction in our growth or expected future growth;\n\u25cf announcements concerning our competitors, the airline industry (including the creditworthiness of airlines) or the economy in general;\n\u25cf announcements concerning the availability of the type of aircraft we own;\n\u25cf general and industry-specific economic conditions;\n\u25cf changes in the price of aircraft fuel;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or failure to meet analysts\u2019 performance expectations;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key members of management;\n\u25cf any increased indebtedness we may incur and the issuance of any additional preferred stock in the future;\n\u25cf speculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or our industry in general or the decision to suspend or terminate coverage in the future;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u25cf changes in or elimination of our dividend;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations affecting the airline industry or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters; and\n\u25cf general market, political and economic conditions, including any such conditions and local conditions in the markets in which our lessees are located.\nBroad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our Class A common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, including periods of sharp decline. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nProvisions in Delaware law and our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may inhibit a takeover of us, which could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline and could entrench management.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests, including the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock, a prohibition on our stockholders from calling special meetings of the stockholders, and advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which we have not opted out of, prohibits a public Delaware corporation from engaging in certain business combinations with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (as defined in such section) for a period of three years following the time that such stockholder became an interested stockholder without the prior consent of our board of directors. The effect of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as well as these charter and bylaws provisions, may make the removal of management more difficult. It may also impede a merger, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our Class A common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees or stockholders.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, (ii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees or stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision is intended to apply to claims arising under Delaware state law and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the Exchange Act of 1934 or Securities Act of 1933, each as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. The exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated bylaws will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. This exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees and stockholders. In addition, stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. However, the enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies' certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find this type of provision to be inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we might incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to obtain financing or to further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of Class A common stock or Series A Preferred Stock or offering debt or additional equity securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes or new series of preferred shares. Issuing additional shares of Class A common stock or other additional equity offerings may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our Class A common stock, or both. Upon liquidation,\nholders of such debt securities, our Series A Preferred Stock and any new series of preferred shares, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings, would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our Class A common stock. Our Series A Preferred Stock have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions and a preference with respect to dividend payments that limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our Class A common stock, subject to certain terms and conditions. Any new series of preferred shares, if issued, could also have such preferences on similar or different terms. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our Class A common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our Class A common stock and diluting their shareholdings in us.\nWe may not be able to pay or maintain dividends, or we may choose not to pay dividends, and the failure to pay or maintain dividends may negatively affect our share price.\nCurrent dividends may not be indicative of the amount of any future quarterly dividends. Our ability to pay, maintain or increase cash dividends to our shareholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our ability to comply with covenants in our financing documents that limit our ability to pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments to shareholders; the difficulty we may experience in raising and the cost of additional capital and our ability to finance our aircraft acquisition commitments; our ability to re-finance our long-term financings before excess cash flows are no longer made available to us to pay dividends and for other purposes; our ability to negotiate and enforce favorable lease rates and other contractual terms; the level of demand for our aircraft; the economic condition of the commercial aviation industry generally; the financial condition and liquidity of our lessees; unexpected or increased expenses; the level and timing of aircraft investments, principal repayments and other capital needs; the value of our aircraft portfolio; our compliance with loan to value, interest rate coverage and other financial tests in our financings; our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity; general business conditions; restrictions imposed by our debt agreements and our Series A Preferred Stock; legal restrictions on the payment of dividends; and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Some of these factors are beyond our control, and a change in any such factor could affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. In the future we may choose not to pay dividends or may not be able to pay dividends, maintain our current level of dividends, or increase them over time. The failure to maintain or pay dividends may negatively affect our share price.\nFuture sales of our Class A Common Stock by existing stockholders, or the perception that these sales may occur, especially by directors, executive officers or significant stockholders of Air Lease, may cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders, in particular our directors, executive officers or other affiliates, sell substantial amounts of our Class A Common Stock in the public market, or are perceived by the public market as intending to sell, the trading price of our Class A Common Stock could decline. In addition, shares underlying any outstanding options and restricted stock units will become eligible for sale if exercised or settled, as applicable, and to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting agreements and Rule 144 of the Securities Act. All the shares of Class A Common Stock subject to stock options and restricted stock units outstanding and reserved for issuance under the Air Lease Corporation 2014 Equity Incentive Plan have been registered on Form S-8 under the Securities Act and such shares are eligible for sale in the public markets, subject to Rule 144 limitations applicable to affiliates. Sale of these shares of Class A Common Stock could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity or equity related securities, should we wish to do so. A significant number of shares of our Class A Common Stock may be sold in the public market by any selling stockholders listed in a prospectus we may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. We cannot predict the timing or amount of future sales of our Class A Common Stock by any such selling stockholders, but such sales, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 12641, "SIC": 7359, "TIC": "AL"}
