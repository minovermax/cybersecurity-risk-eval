SCRIPPS Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nFor an enterprise as large and complex as ours, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. The most significant factors affecting our operations include the following:\nRisks Related to Our Businesses\nWe expect to derive the majority of our revenues from advertising spending, which is affected by numerous factors. Declines in advertising revenues will adversely affect the profitability of our business.\nThe demand for advertising is sensitive to a number of factors, both locally and nationally, including the following:\n\u2022\nThe advertising and marketing spending by customers can be subject to seasonal and cyclical variations and is likely to be adversely affected during economic downturns.\n\u2022\nProgramming and content offered by our businesses may not achieve desired ratings or may decline in popularity with its audience.\n\u2022\nAudiences continue to fragment in recent years as the broad distribution of cable and satellite television and the growth in over-the-top streaming services have greatly increased the options available to the public for accessing audio and video programming, including live sports. Continued fragmentation of audiences, and the growth of internet programming and streaming services, could adversely impact advertising rates, which will reflect the size and demographics of the audience reached by advertisers through our media businesses.\n\u2022\nTelevision advertising revenues in even-numbered years benefit from political advertising, which is affected by campaign finance laws, as well as the competitiveness of specific political races in the markets where our television stations operate.\n\u2022\nContinued consolidation and contraction of local advertisers in our local markets could adversely impact our operating results, given that we expect the majority of our advertising to be sold to local businesses in our markets.\n\u2022\nTelevision stations have significant exposure to advertising in the automotive, retail and services industries. Advertising within these industries may decline and we may not be able to secure replacement advertisers.\n\u2022\nSeveral national advertising agencies are employing an automated process known as \u201cprogrammatic buying\u201d to gain efficiencies and reduce costs related to buying advertising. Growth in advertising revenues will rely in part on the ability to maintain and expand relationships with existing and future advertisers. The implementation of a programmatic model or other similar solution, where automation replaces existing pricing and allocation methods, could turn advertising inventory into a price-driven commodity. These automated solutions could reduce the value of relationships with advertisers as well as result in downward pricing pressure.\nIf we are unable to respond to any or all of these factors, our advertising revenues could decline and affect our profitability.\nWe have made significant investments in our National Media businesses and expect to continue to make significant investments in those businesses in the coming years. Investments we make in our National Media businesses may not perform as expected.\nIn recent years, we have acquired Triton, Katz, Stitcher and Newsy for an aggregate purchase price of almost $550 million. Our National Media businesses are not mature businesses and will require additional capital to gain distribution and build audiences, or, in the case of Triton, build customer base. The markets for these businesses may not develop as we expect, we may face greater competition than we anticipate, and our competition may have greater financial resources. The success of these investments depends on a number of factors, including timely development and market acceptance of the products and services that these businesses offer.\nThe growth of direct content-to-consumer delivery channels may fragment our television audiences. This fragmentation could adversely impact advertising rates as well as cause a reduction in the revenues we receive from retransmission consent agreements, resulting in a loss of revenue that could materially adversely affect our broadcast operations.\nWe deliver our television programming to our audiences primarily over-the-air and through cable and satellite service providers. Our television audience is being fragmented by the digital delivery of content directly to the consumer audience. Content providers, such as the \"Big 4\" broadcast networks, cable networks such as HBO and Showtime, and new content developers, distributors and syndicators such as Amazon, Hulu and Netflix, are now able to deliver their programming directly to consumers, over-the-top (\u201cOTT\u201d) via the internet. The delivery of content directly to consumers allows them to bypass the programming we deliver, which may impact our audience size. Fragmentation of our audiences could impact the rates we receive from our advertisers. In addition, reduction in the number of subscribers to cable and satellite service providers could impact the revenue we receive under retransmission consent agreements. Widespread adoption of OTT by our audiences could result in a reduction of our advertising and retransmission revenues and affect our profitability.\nThe loss of affiliation and carriage agreements or the costs of renewals could adversely affect our operating results.\nEighteen of our stations have affiliations with the ABC television network, eleven with the NBC television network, nine with the CBS television network and four with the FOX television network. Additionally, we have affiliations with the MyNetworkTV television network and the CW television network. These television networks produce and distribute programming which our stations commit to air at specified times. Networks sell commercial advertising time during their programming, and the \"Big 4\" networks, ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX, also require stations to pay fees for the right to carry their programming. These fees may be a percentage of retransmission revenues that the stations receive (see below) or may be fixed amounts based on the number of households or subscribers in a market. These fees have been increasing from renewal to renewal over the past several years.\nKatz has carriage agreements with local television broadcasters and cable and satellite providers to carry one or more of the Katz networks. Through these agreements, each of the networks reaches approximately 90% or more of all U.S. households. These contracts require Katz to make fixed fee payments and generally have three to five-year terms.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to reach network affiliation or carriage agreements in the future. The non-renewal or termination of our network affiliation agreements would prevent us from being able to carry programming of the respective network. Loss of a network affiliation would require us to obtain replacement programming, which may not be as attractive to target audiences and could result in lower advertising revenues. In addition, loss of any of the \"Big 4\" network affiliations would result in materially lower retransmission revenue. The loss of Katz carriage agreements would reduce our advertising revenues and affect our profitability.\nOur retransmission consent revenue may be adversely affected by renewals of retransmission consent agreements, by declines in the number of subscribers to multichannel video programming distributor (\"MVPD\") services, by new technologies for the distribution of video programming, or by revised government regulations.\nAs our retransmission consent agreements expire, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew them at comparable or better rates. As a result, retransmission revenues could decrease and retransmission revenue growth could decline over time.\nIn recent years, the number of subscribers to MVPD services has declined, as the growth of direct internet streaming of video programming to televisions and mobile devices has incentivized consumers to discontinue their cable or satellite service subscriptions. Decreases in the number of MVPD subscribers reduces the revenue we earn under our retransmission agreements.\nThe use of new technologies to redistribute broadcast programming, such as those that rely upon the Internet to deliver video programming or those that receive and record broadcast signals over the air via an antenna and then retransmit that information digitally to customers\u2019 television sets, specialty set-top boxes, or computer or mobile devices, could adversely affect our retransmission revenue if such technologies are not found to be subject to copyright or other legal restrictions or to regulations that apply to MVPDs such as cable operators or satellite carriers.\nChanges in the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cCommunications Act\u201d) or the FCC\u2019s rules with respect to the negotiation of retransmission consent agreements between broadcasters and MVPDs could also adversely impact our ability to negotiate acceptable retransmission consent agreements. In addition, continued consolidation among cable television operators could adversely impact our ability to negotiate acceptable retransmission consent agreements.\nThere are proceedings before the FCC and legislation has been proposed in Congress reexamining policies that now protect television stations' rights to control the distribution of their programming within their local service areas. For example, the FCC has considered the degree to which an entity relying upon the Internet to deliver video programming should be subject to the regulations that apply to MVPDs. Should the FCC determine that Internet-based distributors may avoid its MVPD rules, broadcasters' ability to rely on the protection of the MVPD retransmission consent requirements and other regulations could be jeopardized. We cannot predict the outcome of these and other proceedings that address the use of new technologies to challenge traditional means of redistributing broadcast programming or their possible impact on our operations.\nWe make investments in television programming and podcast content rights (collectively \"content\") in advance of knowing whether that particular content will be popular enough for us to recoup our costs. Additionally, if costs to acquire this content increase or this content becomes more difficult to obtain, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe incur significant costs for the purchase of television programming and podcast content rights. We may have to purchase content several years in advance or enter into multi-year agreements, resulting in the commitment of significant costs in advance of knowing whether the content will be popular with its audience. If this acquired content is not sufficiently popular among audiences in relation to the cost we invest in the content, or if we need to replace content that is performing poorly, we may not be able to produce enough revenue to recover our costs. Additionally, increased competition for content from entrants into the market and the exclusive use of content on streaming services owned by content creators could reduce content availability or increase our content costs. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues, result in the incurrence of impairment charges or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues.\nOur television stations will continue to be subject to government regulations which, if revised, could adversely affect our operating results.\n\u2022\nPursuant to FCC rules, local television stations must elect every three years to either (1) require cable operators and/or direct broadcast satellite carriers to carry the stations\u2019 over-the-air signals or (2) enter into retransmission consent negotiations for carriage. At present, all but one of our stations have retransmission consent agreements with cable operators and satellite carriers. If our retransmission consent agreements are terminated or not renewed, or if our broadcast signals are distributed on less-favorable terms, our ability to compete effectively may be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nIf we cannot renew our FCC broadcast licenses, our broadcast operations will be impaired. Our business depends upon maintaining our broadcast licenses from the FCC, which has the authority to revoke licenses, not renew them, or renew them only with significant qualifications, including renewals for less than a full term. We cannot assure that future renewal applications will be approved, or that the renewals will not include conditions or qualifications that could adversely affect operations. If the FCC fails to renew any of these licenses, it could prevent us from operating the affected stations. If the FCC renews a license with substantial conditions or modifications (including renewing the license for a term of fewer than eight years), it could have a material adverse effect on the affected station\u2019s revenue potential.\n\u2022\nAs discussed under Federal Regulation of Broadcasting, the FCC in 2017 completed an auction in which some television licensees voluntarily auctioned away their spectrum rights and 84 MHz of broadcast spectrum was reallocated to other uses. As a result, many television stations, including 27 Company-owned full-power and Class A stations, were required to change their operating frequencies, and the FCC is setting tight deadlines for the completion of these facility changes in order to make the reallocated spectrum promptly available to the wireless service buyers. Depending on factors such as the availability of specialized technical assistance and custom-made equipment, weather issues, and, for stations near international borders, the cooperation of foreign governments, some stations could confront substantial costs and difficulty in completing these relocations within the allotted time, adversely affecting these stations\u2019 over-the-air service. Scripps has received construction permits to complete the required changes for its stations and is expeditiously pursuing the steps necessary to complete this process. As of February 28, 2020, 18 of the 27 affected Scripps stations were licensed on their new channels. We cannot predict whether unforeseen circumstances might delay implementation and have a material adverse effect on one or more of the remaining stations' revenue potential.\n\u2022\nAs also discussed under Federal Regulation of Broadcasting, the FCC has adopted broadcasters\u2019 proposal to permit the voluntary use of a new digital television transmission standard, ATSC 3.0, that is incompatible with the existing standard. Much uncertainty exists concerning the costs, benefits, and public acceptance of the services expected to become possible under this new standard, and television stations could be adversely affected by moving either too quickly or too slowly towards its adoption.\n\u2022\nThe FCC and other government agencies are continually considering proposals intended to promote consumer interests. New government regulations affecting the television industry could raise programming costs, restrict broadcasters\u2019 operating flexibility, reduce advertising revenues, raise the costs of delivering broadcast signals, or otherwise affect operating results. We cannot predict the nature or scope of future government regulation or its impact on our operations.\nAcquisitions involve risks and, if said risks are not managed effectively, our operating results could be negatively affected.\nDuring 2019, we acquired 27 television stations through multiple transactions for total cash consideration of $1.2 billion. Acquisitions involve inherent risks, such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures, facilities and systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected if we are unable to implement effective cost controls, achieve expected synergies, or increase revenues as a result of these acquisitions. Acquisitions can result in unexpected liabilities and potentially divert management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nWe intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions, and there are various risks associated with an acquisition strategy.\nWe have pursued and intend to selectively continue to pursue strategic acquisitions, subject to market conditions, our liquidity, and the availability of attractive acquisition candidates, with the goal of improving our business. We may not be able to identify other attractive acquisition targets or some of our competitors may have greater financial or managerial resources with which to pursue acquisition targets we may pursue. Therefore, even if we are successful in identifying attractive acquisition targets, we may face considerable competition and be unsuccessful in acquiring such targets.\nAcquisitions of television stations are subject to the approval of the FCC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Current or future policies of these regulatory authorities could restrict our ability to pursue or consummate future transactions and could require us to divest certain television stations if an acquisition under contract would result in excessive concentration in a market or fail to comply with FCC ownership limitations. There can be no assurance that an acquisition will be approved by these regulatory authorities, or that a requirement to divest existing stations will not have an adverse effect on the transaction or our business.\nWe will continue to face cybersecurity and similar risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, disruption of operations, damage to our brands and reputation, legal exposure and financial losses.\nSecurity breaches, malware or other \u201ccyber attacks\u201d could harm our business by disrupting delivery of services, jeopardizing our confidential information and that of our vendors and clients, and damaging our reputation. Our operations are routinely involved in receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information. Although we monitor security measures regularly, any unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, theft of data, network disruption, denial of service, or similar act by any party could disrupt the integrity, continuity, and security of our systems or the systems of our clients or vendors. These events, or our failure to employ new technologies, revise processes and invest in people to sustain our ability to defend against cyber threats, could create financial liability, regulatory sanction, or a loss of confidence in our ability to protect information, and adversely affect our revenue by causing the loss of current or potential clients.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Scripps Class A Common Shares\nCertain descendants of Edward W. Scripps own approximately 93% of Scripps' Common Voting shares and are signatories to the Scripps Family Agreement, which governs the transfer and voting of Common Voting shares held by them.\nAs a result of the foregoing, these descendants have the ability to elect two-thirds of the Board of Directors and to direct the outcome of any matter on which the Ohio Revised Code (\u201cORC\u201d) does not require a vote of our Class A Common shares. Under our articles of incorporation, holders of Class A Common shares vote only for the election of one-third of the Board of Directors and are not entitled to vote on any matter other than a limited number of matters expressly set forth in the ORC as requiring a separate vote of both classes of stock. Because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction, the market price of our Class A Common shares could be adversely affected.\nWe have the ability to issue preferred stock, which could affect the rights of holders of our Class A Common shares.\nOur articles of incorporation allow the Board of Directors to issue and set the terms of 25 million shares of preferred stock. The terms of any such preferred stock, if issued, may adversely affect the dividend, liquidation and other rights of holders of our Class A Common shares.\nThe public price and trading volume of our Class A Common shares may be volatile.\nThe price and trading volume of our Class A Common shares may be volatile and subject to fluctuation. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuation in the stock price or trading volume of Class A Common shares include:\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions and market trends, including in the television broadcast industry, the national media marketplace and the financial markets generally;\n\u2022\nthe political, economic and social situation in the United States;\n\u2022\nvariations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\ninability to meet revenue forecasts;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments or other business developments;\n\u2022\nadoption of new accounting standards affecting the media industry;\n\u2022\noperations of competitors and the performance of competitors\u2019 common stock;\n\u2022\nlitigation and governmental action involving or affecting us or our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nrecruitment of key personnel;\n\u2022\npurchases or sales of blocks of our Class A Common shares;\n\u2022\noperating and stock performance of companies that investors may consider to be comparable to us; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment, including rulemaking or other actions by the FCC.\nThere can be no assurance that the price of our Class A Common shares will not fluctuate or decline significantly. The stock market in recent years has experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies and that could adversely affect the price of our Class A Common shares, regardless of the Company\u2019s operating performance. Stock price volatility might be higher if the trading volume of our Class A Common shares is low. Furthermore, shareholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our Class A Common shares declines significantly, which may cause us to incur substantial costs and divert the time and attention of our management.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe have substantial debt and have the ability to incur significant additional debt. The principal and interest payment obligations on such debt may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our long-term obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we and the guarantors had approximately $1.95 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness (excluding intercompany debt), approximately $900 million of which constituted senior debt (including the Senior Notes), and none of which was secured. We have the ability to incur up to $210 million of indebtedness under our Credit Agreement all of which is secured indebtedness, effectively ranking senior to the Senior Notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. Our Credit Agreement matures in April 2022.\nOur outstanding debt may have important consequences to you. For instance, it could:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which would reduce funds available for other business purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that may have less debt and better access to capital resources;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing required to fund acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; and\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to the Senior Notes.\nOur ability to service our significant financial obligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow. This is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to us under our Credit Agreement or any other credit facilities, or that we will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our operations or pay our debts and other obligations, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Specifically, volatility in the capital markets may also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, or to refinance our existing debt, on terms or at times favorable to us. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to service our debt or other obligations, which could result in us being in default thereon, in which circumstances our lenders could cease making loans to us, and lenders or other holders of our debt could accelerate and declare due all outstanding obligations under the respective agreements, which would likely have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe agreements governing our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our operations and limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions.\nThe agreements governing our various debt obligations, including the indenture that governs the Senior Notes and the agreements governing our Credit Agreement, include covenants imposing significant restrictions on our operations. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place restrictions, subject to certain limitations, on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\ndeclare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;\n\u2022\nmake investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\ncreate liens or use assets as security in other transactions;\n\u2022\nissue guarantees;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\npurchase, sell or transfer certain assets.\nAny of these restrictions and limitations could make it more difficult for us to execute our business strategy.\nOur Credit Agreement requires us to comply with certain financial ratios and covenants; our failure to do so will result in a default thereunder, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are required to comply with certain financial covenants under our Credit Agreement. Our ability to comply with these requirements may be affected by events affecting our business, but beyond our control, including prevailing general economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on us by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the applicable senior credit facility. Upon a default under any of our debt agreements, the lenders or debt holders thereunder could have the right to declare all amounts outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable, which could, in turn, trigger defaults under other debt obligations and could result in the termination of commitments of the lenders to make further extensions of credit under such senior credit facility. If we were unable to repay our secured debt to our lenders, or were otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding secured debt obligations, our secured lenders could proceed against us and the subsidiary guarantors and against the collateral securing that debt. Any default resulting in an acceleration of outstanding indebtedness, a termination of commitments under our financing arrangements or lenders proceeding against the collateral securing such indebtedness would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our Credit Agreement are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If the London Interbank Offered Rate were to increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available to service our obligations, including making payments on the notes, would decrease.", "PERMNO": 84176, "SIC": 4833, "TIC": "SSP"}
