RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe operate in categories with strong competition.\nThe consumer food and beverage, sports nutrition and sports supplement categories are highly competitive. Competition in these categories is based on, among other things, product quality, price, effective promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy dynamic, emerging consumer preferences. Our competitors may have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. Increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures. Competitive and customer pressures, as well as industry supply and market demand, also may limit our ability to increase prices, including in response to cost increases. In most product categories, we compete not only with widely advertised branded products, but also with private label and store brand products. A strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a shift in consumer preferences to competitors\u2019 products, could result in us reducing prices, increasing marketing or other expenditures or losing market share. Our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume. In addition, our competitors are increasingly using social media networks to advertise products. If we are unable to compete in this environment, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe must identify changing consumer and customer preferences and develop and offer products to meet these preferences.\nConsumer and customer preferences evolve over time. The success of our products depends on our ability to identify these changing preferences and to offer products that appeal to consumers and customers. Consumer preference changes include dietary trends, attention to different nutritional aspects of foods and beverages, concerns regarding the health effects of certain foods and beverages, sourcing practices relating to ingredients and animal welfare concerns. Any significant changes in consumer preferences or our inability to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products and negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Refrigerated Food business is and will continue to be affected by changing preferences as to the housing of egg-laying hens. Many restaurant chains, foodservice companies and grocery chains have announced goals to transition to a cage-free egg supply by specified future dates. Meeting anticipated customer demand has resulted, and will continue to result, in additional operating and capital costs to procure cage-free eggs, to modify existing layer facilities and to construct new cage-free layer housing. These changing preferences also could require us to use specially sourced ingredients that may be more difficult to source or entail a higher cost or incremental capital investment which we may not be able to pass on to customers.\nOur results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain favorable perceptions of our brands.\nMaintaining and continually enhancing the value of our brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including adverse publicity about our products, packaging or ingredients (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, our products becoming unavailable to consumers or consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner. Consumer demand for our products also may be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers, us and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, products or packaging or the food industry generally on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain favorable perceptions of our brands, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nWe will be subject to a number of uncertainties while we pursue the initial public offering of our Active Nutrition business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nWhile we have announced our intention to pursue an initial public offering of our Active Nutrition business, there is no assurance that we will be able to consummate such transaction on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to consummate such transaction on favorable terms or at all, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our shareholders and employees. In addition, in the event that we are able to consummate such transaction, there is no assurance that we will realize the anticipated value from such transaction. In addition, we and our Active Nutrition business will be required to devote significant management and employee attention and resources to matters relating to the initial public offering. These matters have the potential to disrupt both us and the Active Nutrition business from conducting business operations and could adversely affect the business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows of us and our Active Nutrition business. The Active Nutrition business also could lose key employees as a result of the transaction.\nOur business strategy depends on us identifying and completing additional acquisitions and other strategic transactions. We may not be able to successfully consummate favorable strategic transactions in the future. Our corporate development activities also may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we continuously evaluate strategic transactions, we may be unable to identify suitable strategic transactions in the future or may not be able to enter into such transactions at favorable prices. Alternatively, we may in the future enter into additional strategic transactions, and any such transaction could happen at any time, could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including, for example, an acquisition, investment or merger, for cash or in exchange for our equity securities, or a divestiture.\nEvaluating potential transactions, including divestitures, requires additional expenditures (including legal, accounting and due diligence expenses, higher administrative costs to support the acquired entities and information technology, personnel and other integration expenses) and may divert the attention of our management from ordinary operating matters.\nOur corporate development activities also may present financial and operational risks and may have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. In addition, future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses, all of which could singly or collectively adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of the Bob Evans acquisition.\nThe acquisition of Bob Evans has involved the combination of two companies that have historically operated independently. In order to realize the anticipated benefits of the Bob Evans acquisition, we have been and will continue to be required to devote significant management attention and resources to aligning the business practices, cultures and operations of each business. We may encounter difficulties as we continue align these businesses in a manner that permits us to achieve the synergies and other benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition. Accordingly, the contemplated benefits of the Bob Evans acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nWe may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of the Weetabix Group acquisition.\nThe acquisition of the Weetabix Group has involved the combination of two companies that have historically operated independently. In order to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, we will be required to continue to devote significant management attention and resources to aligning the business practices, cultures and operations of each business, in particular, our Post Consumer Brands business and Weetabix NA\u2019s business operations. We may encounter difficulties as we continue align these businesses in a manner that permits us to achieve the synergies and other benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition. Accordingly, the contemplated benefits of the Weetabix Group acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, or acquisitions may not perform as expected.\nWe have acquired multiple businesses, and we may continue to acquire other businesses. The successful integration of these acquisitions depends on our ability to manage the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses. Integrating operations is complex and requires significant efforts and expenses on the part of both us and the acquired businesses. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nemployees may voluntarily or involuntarily separate employment from us or the acquired businesses because of the acquisitions;\n\u2022\nour management may have its attention diverted while trying to integrate the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nwe may encounter obstacles when incorporating the acquired businesses into our operations and management, including integrating or separating personnel, financial systems, operating procedures, regulatory compliance programs, technology, networks and other assets in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies;\n\u2022\ndifferences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\u2022\nintegration may be more costly, more time consuming and complex or less effective than anticipated;\n\u2022\ninability to maintain uniform standards, controls and procedures; and\n\u2022\nwe may discover previously undetected operational or other issues, such as fraud.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect our and the acquired businesses\u2019 ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies.\nIn addition, the success of these acquired businesses will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies through the successful integration of the businesses we acquire with our existing businesses. Even if we are successful in integrating acquired businesses, we cannot assure you that these integrations will result in the realization of the full benefit of any anticipated growth opportunities or cost synergies or that these benefits will be realized within the expected time frames. In addition, acquired businesses may have unanticipated liabilities or contingencies.\nHigher freight costs, commodity price volatility and availability and higher energy costs could negatively impact profits.\nOur freight costs may increase due to factors such as increased fuel costs, limited carrier availability, increased compliance costs associated with new or changing government regulations and inflation. The primary commodities used by our businesses include wheat, oats, rice, corn, other grain products, eggs, sows, potatoes, cheese, vegetable oils, dried fruit, nuts, dairy and soy-based proteins, cocoa, corn syrup and sugar. The supply and price of these ingredients are subject to market conditions and are influenced by many factors beyond our control, including animal feed costs, weather patterns affecting ingredient production, governmental programs and regulations, insects, plant diseases and inflation. Our primary packaging materials include linerboard cartons, corrugated boxes, plastic containers, flexible and beverage packaging, cartonboard, and aseptic foil and plastic lined cartonboard. In addition, our manufacturing operations use large quantities of natural gas, propane and electricity. The cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely, and we may experience shortages in commodity items as a result of commodity availability, increased demand, weather conditions and natural disasters, as well as other factors outside of our control. Higher prices for natural gas, propane, electricity and fuel also may increase our production and delivery costs. The prices charged for our products may not reflect changes in our freight, commodity and energy costs at the time they occur or at all. Accordingly, changes in freight, commodity or energy costs may limit our ability to maintain existing margins and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we fail to hedge and prices subsequently increase, or if we institute a hedge and prices subsequently decrease, our costs may be greater than anticipated or greater than our competitors\u2019 costs, and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur Refrigerated Food segment\u2019s operating results are significantly affected by egg, sow, potato and cheese prices and the prices of corn and soybean meal, which are the primary grains fed to laying hens. Historically, the prices of these raw materials have fluctuated widely. In addition, our Refrigerated Food segment\u2019s cheese and butter products are affected by milk price supports established by the USDA. Although steps can be taken to mitigate the effects of changes in raw material costs, fluctuations in prices are outside of our control, and changes in the price of such items may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Certain supply and demand disruptions, such as those resulting from diseases affecting livestock and those experienced with the 2015 avian influenza outbreak, could create an inability to keep selling prices in line with input costs and may result in significant fluctuations in operating profit margins.\nImpairment in the carrying value of intangible assets could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. If our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we will be required to record additional impairment charges, which may be significant.\nOur balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets, including goodwill, trademarks, trade names and other acquired intangibles. Intangibles and goodwill expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but our management reviews them for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. Impairments to intangible assets may be caused by factors outside of our control, such as increasing competitive pricing pressures, lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates, changes in industry EBITDA and revenue multiples, changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital (interest rates, etc.) or the bankruptcy of a significant customer. These factors, along with other internal and external factors, could have a significant negative impact on our fair value determination, which could then result in a material impairment charge in our results of operations. In fiscal 2018, we had an impairment of other intangible assets and no impairment of goodwill. In fiscal 2017, we had an impairment of goodwill and no impairment of other intangible assets. In fiscal 2016, we had no impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets. We could have additional impairments in the future. See further discussion of these impairments in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of this report and Notes 2 and 7 within the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d contained in this report.\nUnsuccessful implementation of business strategies to reduce costs may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMany of our costs, such as raw materials, energy and freight, are outside of our control. Therefore, we must seek to reduce costs in other areas, such as through operating efficiency. If we are not able to complete projects designed to reduce costs and increase operating efficiency on time or within budget, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted. In addition, if the cost-saving initiatives we have implemented, or any future cost-saving initiatives, do not generate the expected cost savings and synergies, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nEconomic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.\nThe willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on general or local economic conditions. In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may purchase less of our products or may forgo certain purchases altogether. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of our products. In addition, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect profit margins. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our products become adulterated, misbranded or mislabeled or become contaminated, we might need to recall or withdraw those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured.\nSelling food products, beverages and nutritional supplements involves a number of legal and other risks, including contamination, spoilage, tampering, mislabeling or other adulteration. Additionally, many of the raw materials used to make certain of our products, particularly eggs, pork, raw potatoes, grains and nuts, are vulnerable to contamination by naturally occurring molds and pathogens, such as salmonella. We may need to recall or withdraw some or all of our products if they become adulterated, mislabeled or misbranded, whether caused by us or someone in our supply chain. A recall or withdrawal could result in destruction of product inventory, negative publicity, temporary plant closings, supply chain interruption, substantial costs of compliance or remediation, fines and increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies. Should consumption of any product cause injury, we may be liable for monetary damages as a result of a judgment against us. In addition, adverse publicity, including claims, whether or not valid, that our products or ingredients are unsafe or of poor quality, may discourage consumers or customers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. Any of these events, including a significant product liability claim against us, could result in a loss of consumer or customer confidence in our food products. Although we have various insurance programs in place, any of these events and/or a loss of consumer or customer confidence could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nViolations of laws or regulations, as well as new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations, could adversely affect our business.\nThe food industry is subject to a variety of federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, including requirements related to food safety, quality, manufacturing, processing, storage, marketing, advertising, labeling and distribution, as well as those related to worker health and workplace safety. Our activities, both inside and outside of the United States, are subject to extensive regulation. In the United States, we are regulated by, or our activities are affected by, among other federal and state authorities and regulations, the FDA, the USDA, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and California\u2019s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65). In Europe, we are regulated by, among other authorities, the U.K.\u2019s Food Standards Agency, Health and Safety Executive, Environment Agency, Environmental Health Officers and Trading Standards Officers and their equivalents in other European Union member states. We also are regulated by similar authorities elsewhere in the world. Governmental regulations also affect taxes and levies, healthcare costs, energy usage and immigration and labor issues, any or all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our business or the businesses of our customers or suppliers. In addition, we could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state and foreign laws and regulations and may be subject to initiatives to limit or prohibit the marketing and advertising of our products to children.\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, changes in these laws or regulations or the introduction of new laws or regulations could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers, causing our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to be adversely affected. As specific examples, some states have passed laws that mandate specific housing requirements for layer hens and mandate specific space requirements for farm animal enclosures, including layer hens and pigs. Further, if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas, we could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, revocations of required licenses, injunctions or recalls, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe continue to examine the impact that the enacted tax reform legislation, commonly referred to as the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, may have on our business or our future results of operations, profitability, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, the United States, Canada and Mexico have renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement. Impacts of the changes brought about by the new agreement, named the United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement (the \u201cUSMCA\u201d), for which the language has not yet been finalized, are not currently known. However, given the integrated nature of our North American operations and supply chain, we continue to monitor closely the status and implementation of the USMCA.\nCertain of our Active Nutrition and Refrigerated Food products are subject to a higher level of regulatory scrutiny, resulting in increased costs of operations and the potential for delays in product sales.\nSome of our Active Nutrition products are regulated by the FDA as dietary supplements, which are subject to different FDA regulations and levels of regulatory scrutiny. Certain of our Refrigerated Food\u2019s meat and egg products are subject to continuous on-site inspections by the USDA. It also is possible that federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take regulatory or enforcement action, which could result in significant fines or penalties. If we are found to be significantly out of compliance, an\nenforcement authority could issue a warning letter and/or institute enforcement actions that could result in additional costs, substantial delays in production or even a temporary shutdown in manufacturing and product sales while the non-conformances are rectified. Also, we may have to recall product or otherwise remove product from the market, and temporarily cease its manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues. Any product liability claims resulting from the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations would be expensive to defend and could result in substantial damage awards against us or harm our reputation. Any of these events would negatively impact our revenues and costs of operations.\nLoss of, a significant reduction of purchases by or bankruptcy of a major customer may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA limited number of customer accounts represents a large percentage of our consolidated net sales. Our largest customer, Walmart, accounted for approximately 13% of our net sales in fiscal 2018. Walmart also is the largest customer of our Post Consumer Brands segment, accounting for approximately 29% of Post Consumer Brands\u2019 net sales in fiscal 2018. The largest customers of our Weetabix segment, Tesco, Asda, Morrison\u2019s and Sainsbury\u2019s, accounted for approximately 52% of Weetabix\u2019s net sales in fiscal 2018. Additionally, the largest customers of our Refrigerated Food segment, Sysco and US Foods, accounted for approximately 27% of its net sales in fiscal 2018, and the largest customers of our Active Nutrition segment, Costco and Sam\u2019s Club, accounted for approximately 59% of the Active Nutrition segment\u2019s net sales in fiscal 2018. The largest customer of our historical Private Brands segment, Whole Foods, accounted for approximately 16% of Private Brands\u2019 net sales in fiscal 2018.\nThe success of our businesses depends, in part, on our ability to maintain our level of sales and product distribution through high-volume food distributors, retailers, club stores, super centers and mass merchandisers. The competition to supply products to these high-volume stores is intense. Currently, we do not have long-term supply agreements with a substantial number of our retail customers, including our largest customers. These high-volume stores and mass merchandisers frequently reevaluate the products they carry. A decision by our major customers to decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from us, sell another national brand on an exclusive basis or change the manner of doing business with us could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our customers offer branded and private label products that compete directly with our products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. Accordingly, there is a risk that our customers may give higher priority to their own products or to the products of our competitors. In the event of a loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction of purchases by any of our large customers or the bankruptcy or serious financial difficulty of any of our large customers, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nConsolidation in the retail and foodservice distribution channels, and competitive, economic and other pressures facing our customers, may hurt our profit margins.\nOver the past several years, the retail and foodservice channels have undergone significant consolidations and mass merchandisers and non-traditional retailers are gaining market share. As this trend continues and such customers grow larger, they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other value brands and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to respond to these requirements, our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if any of our existing retailer or distributor customers are consolidated with another entity and the surviving entity of any such consolidation is not a customer or decides to discontinue purchasing our products, we may lose significant amounts of our preexisting business with the acquired retailer or distributor. Further, the economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing, such as the emergence of new sales channels like e-commerce, and our customers\u2019 responses to those changes could impact our businesses. The consolidation in the retail and foodservice channels also increases the risk that adverse changes to our customers\u2019 business operations or financial performance would have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe will be required to make a cash payment to former Bob Evans stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares and have not withdrawn their demands, and such payment could exceed the merger consideration that we would have paid to such stockholders.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Bob Evans, we have not paid any merger consideration to former holders of Bob Evans common stock who demanded appraisal of their shares under Delaware law and have not withdrawn their demands. If such appraisal proceedings reach a verdict, such stockholders that are determined to have validly perfected their appraisal rights will be entitled to a cash payment equal to the fair value of their shares, plus statutory interest, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. The amounts that we may be required to pay to such stockholders in connection with the demands for appraisal and appraisal proceedings is uncertain at this time, but could be greater than the merger consideration to which such stockholders would have been entitled had they not demanded appraisal.\nPending and future litigation may impair our reputation or lead us to incur significant costs.\nWe are, or may become, party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business, which may include lawsuits or claims relating to contracts, intellectual property, product recalls, product liability, false or deceptive advertising, employment matters, environmental matters or other aspects of our business. Negative publicity resulting from allegations made\nin lawsuits or claims asserted against us, whether or not valid, may adversely affect our reputation. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The outcome of litigation is often difficult to predict, and the outcome of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we have various insurance programs in place, the potential liabilities associated with these litigation matters, or those that could arise in the future, could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed the coverage provided by such programs. In addition, insurance carriers may seek to rescind or deny coverage with respect to pending or future claims or lawsuits. If we do not have sufficient coverage under our policies, or if coverage is denied, we may be required to make material payments to settle litigation or satisfy any judgment. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are currently dependent on third party manufacturers to manufacture many products for our business. Our business could suffer as a result of a third party manufacturer\u2019s inability to produce our products for us on time or to our specifications.\nOur business relies on independent third parties for the manufacture of many products, such as shakes, protein bars and powders, breakfast drinks, certain cereal and granola products and certain refrigerated food products. Our business could be materially affected if we fail to develop or maintain our relationships with these third parties, if these third parties fail to comply with governmental regulations applicable to the manufacturing of our products or if any of these third parties ceases doing business with us or goes out of business. Additionally, we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with these third party manufacturers, such as increases in manufacturing costs, reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with merchandise specifications, insufficient quality control and failure to meet production deadlines. The inability of a third party manufacturer to ship orders in a timely manner, in desirable quantities or to meet our safety, quality and social compliance standards or regulatory requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business. While certain of our relationships with these third parties are subject to minimum volume commitments, whereby the third party manufacturer has committed to produce and we have committed to purchase a minimum quantity of product, we may nonetheless experience situations where such manufacturers are unable to fulfill their obligations under our agreements.\nOur historical Private Brands business has been separately capitalized with an unaffiliated third party, over which we have less control.\nAs a result of the completion of the previously announced transaction involving our historical Private Brands business, we hold 6.05 million shares of 8th Avenue Class B common stock, and THL holds 3.95 million shares of 8th Avenue Class A common stock and 2.5 million shares of 8th Avenue Series A preferred stock. Although we hold a substantial majority of the voting power of 8th Avenue\u2019s common stock and have the power to appoint a majority of the members of 8th Avenue\u2019s board of directors, THL holds certain corporate governance and other rights with respect to 8th Avenue, and we cannot control the actions of THL. THL may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals. Differences in views among THL and us may result in delayed decisions or disputes. THL\u2019s interest could be sold to a third party, or 8th Avenue or its subsidiaries could be disposed of, in whole or in part, to third parties. These factors could potentially adversely impact the business and operations of 8th Avenue and, in turn, our business and operations.\nOur historical financial information may not be indicative of our future financial performance as a result of the transaction involving our historical Private Brands business. In addition, if our investment in 8th Avenue is not profitable, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nAs of October 1, 2018, in connection with the transaction involving our historical Private Brands business, 8th Avenue and its subsidiaries were deconsolidated from our financial statements. As a result, our balance sheets and statements of operations following the deconsolidation will not be comparable to the balance sheets and statements of operations reflected in our historical financial statements for periods prior to deconsolidation.\nIn addition, as of October 1, 2018, we hold 60.5% of the common equity of 8th Avenue. The 60.5% retained interest in 8th Avenue is accounted for using the equity method, and the carrying value of the investment in 8th Avenue will be included on our balance sheet and returns from our investment in 8th Avenue will be included in our results of operations. If our investment in 8th Avenue is not profitable, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe are subject to certain continuing obligations, including indemnification obligations and lease guarantor obligations, related to the sale of the Bob Evans restaurants business that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn April 2017, prior to our acquisition of Bob Evans, Bob Evans completed the sale and separation of its restaurants business (the \u201cBob Evans Restaurants Transaction\u201d) to Bob Evans Restaurants, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company formed by affiliates of Golden Gate Capital Opportunity Fund, L.P. (the \u201cBob Evans Restaurants Buyer\u201d), pursuant to a sale agreement between Bob Evans and the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer (the \u201cRestaurants Sale Agreement\u201d). As a result of our acquisition of Bob Evans,\nwe have the obligation to indemnify the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer for certain breaches of the Restaurants Sale Agreement and certain other liabilities set forth in the Restaurants Sale Agreement.\nIn addition, in connection with the Bob Evans Restaurants Transaction, the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer assumed the lease obligations of the Bob Evans restaurants business. However, as part of a sale leaseback transaction of 143 of Bob Evans\u2019s restaurant properties that Bob Evans completed in 2016, Bob Evans and one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into payment and performance guaranties relating to the leases on such restaurant properties, which remained in place after the completion of the Bob Evans Restaurants Transaction. Although the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer assumed responsibility for the payment and performance obligations under the leases on the sale leaseback properties, under the terms of the guaranties, we remain liable for payments due under these leases if the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer fails to satisfy its lease obligations. Any such unexpected expenses related to our obligations under the payment and performance guaranties or under the Restaurants Sale Agreement could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments operate in the mature RTE cereal category, and the failure or weakening of this category could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments together produce and distribute branded, licensed and private label RTE cereals and hot cereals, other cereal-based food products and muesli, selling products to grocery stores, discounters, big box retailers, foodservice distributors, wholesalers and convenience stores across the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Ireland and the rest of the world. The RTE cereal category has experienced weakness in recent years, and we expect this trend may continue. Although we expect to achieve synergies in connection with our acquisition of the Weetabix Group, continuing weakness in the RTE cereal category, or the weakening of our major products competing in this category, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur sales and profit growth is dependent upon our ability to expand existing market penetration and enter into new markets.\nSuccessful growth depends in part on our ability to add new retail customers, as well as expand the number of products sold through existing retail customers. This would include expanding the number of our items they offer for sale and product placement. The expansion of the business of our existing segments depends on our ability to obtain new, or expand our business with existing, large-account customers, such as grocery store chains and mass merchandisers. Our failure to obtain new, or expand our business with existing, large-account customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTermination of our material intellectual property licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe market certain of our products in the United States, Canada, the U.K. and several other locations pursuant to intellectual property license agreements. These licenses give us the right to use certain names, characters and logos in connection with our products and to sell the products in certain regions. If we were to breach any material term of these license agreements and not timely cure the breach, the licensor could terminate the agreement. If the licensor were to terminate our rights to use the names, characters and logos for this reason or any other reason, or if a licensor decided not to renew a license agreement upon the expiration of the license term, the loss of such rights could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur private label products may not be able to compete successfully with nationally branded products.\nSeveral of our segments produce and distribute private label products. In many cases, competitors with nationally branded products have a competitive advantage over private label products due to name recognition. In addition, when branded competitors focus on price and promotion, the environment for private label producers and distributors becomes more challenging because the price differential between private label products and branded products may become less significant. Competitive pressures or promotions of branded products could cause us or our customers to lose sales, which may require us to lower prices or increase the use of our own discounting or promotional programs, each of which would adversely affect our margins, financial condition, results of operations, profitability and cash flows.\nDisruption of our supply chain and changes in weather conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn coordination with our suppliers, business partners and contract manufacturers, our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our collective manufacturing or distribution capabilities resulting from weather, any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, disease, fire, explosion, cyber-attacks, terrorism, pandemics, strikes, repairs or enhancements at our facilities or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture, sell or timely deliver our products.\nIn addition, the manufacturing capabilities for certain of our products are concentrated at certain of our facilities and with certain third party manufacturers. If we had to close or limit production of all or part of the operations at one or more of such facilities for any reason, or if certain of these third party manufacturers were unable to produce our desired quantities, we may be unable to increase production at our other facilities or with other third party manufacturers in a timely manner, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in weather conditions and natural disasters also may affect the cost and supply of commodities and raw materials, including grains, eggs, sows, potatoes, nuts, corn syrup and sugar. Additionally, these events can result in lower recoveries of usable raw materials. Competitors can be affected differently by weather conditions and natural disasters depending on the location of their suppliers and operations. Failure to take adequate steps to reduce the likelihood or mitigate the potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a commodity or raw material is sourced from a single location, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and/or require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nOur international operations subject us to additional risks.\nWe are subject to a number of risks related to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences;\n\u2022\nunfavorable changes in tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or other export or import restrictions;\n\u2022\nunfavorable foreign exchange controls and currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nincreased exposure to general market and economic conditions outside of the United States;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic uncertainty and volatility;\n\u2022\nthe potential for substantial penalties and litigation related to violations of a wide variety of laws, treaties and regulations, including anti-corruption regulations (including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act) and privacy laws and regulations (including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation);\n\u2022\nthe difficulty and costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty and costs of maintaining effective data security; and\n\u2022\nunfavorable and/or changing foreign tax treaties and policies.\nOur financial performance on a United States dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our principal exposure is to the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar and the Euro.\nUnited States and global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers.\nUnited States and global credit markets have, from time to time, experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and in certain cases resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing. Events affecting the credit markets also have had an adverse effect on other financial markets in the United States, which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock or other equity securities or refinance our existing debt, sell our assets or borrow more money, if necessary. Our business also could be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy. Any of these risks could impair our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business or increase our interest expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanging currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have operations and assets in the United States as well as foreign jurisdictions, and a portion of our contracts and revenues are denominated in foreign currencies. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars. We therefore must translate our foreign assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into United States dollars at applicable exchange rates. Consequently, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar may negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements. To the extent we fail to manage our foreign currency exposure adequately, we may suffer losses in value of our net foreign currency investment, and our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.\nThe uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of Brexit may cause increased economic volatility, affecting our operations and business.\nThe results of the referendum relating to the membership of the U.K. in the European Union, advising for the exit of the U.K. from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d), may cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to European Union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently.\nThe measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose customers, suppliers and employees. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate.\nThese developments may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAgricultural diseases or pests could harm our business.\nMany of our business activities are subject to a variety of agricultural risks, including diseases and pests, which can adversely affect the quality and quantity of the raw materials we use, as well as the products we produce and distribute. Any actual or potential contamination of our products could result in product recalls, market withdrawals, safety alerts, cessation of manufacturing or distribution or, if we fail to comply with applicable FDA, USDA or other regulatory authority requirements, enforcement actions. We also could be subject to product liability claims or adverse publicity if any of our products are alleged to have caused illness or injury.\nAvian influenza occasionally affects the domestic poultry industry, leading to hen deaths. In 2015, an avian influenza outbreak occurred in the midwest of the United States affecting a substantial portion of our owned and third party contracted flocks. Although we utilize biosecurity measures at our layer locations to protect against disease exposures, if our facilities are exposed to diseases and pests, such exposure could affect a substantial portion of our production facilities in any year and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Diseases affecting livestock occasionally impact sow supply, which also could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to operate successfully if we lose key personnel, are unable to hire qualified additional personnel or experience turnover of our management team.\nWe are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business. If we lose key personnel or one or more members of our senior management team, or if we fail to attract new employees, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed.\nLabor strikes or work stoppages by our employees could harm our business.\nSome of our full-time production, maintenance and warehouse employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. A dispute with a union or employees represented by a union could result in production interruptions caused by work stoppages. If a strike or work stoppage were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, we could be subject to unionization efforts at our non-union facilities. Increased unionization of our workforce could lead to disruptions in our business, increases in our operating costs and constraints on our operating flexibility.\nIn the event of a work stoppage, we have contingency plans in place to hire additional labor or manufacture products in other locations to mitigate disruption to our business. However, there are limitations inherent in any plan to mitigate disruption to our business in the event of a work stoppage and, particularly in the case of a prolonged work stoppage, there can be no assurance that it would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may experience losses or be subject to increased funding and expenses to our qualified pension and other postretirement plans, which could negatively impact profits.\nWe maintain qualified defined benefit plans in the United States, Canada and the U.K. primarily for our Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix businesses, and we are obligated to ensure that these plans are funded or paid in accordance with applicable regulations. In the event the assets in which we invest do not perform according to expectations, or the valuation of the projected benefit obligation increases due to changes in interest rates or other factors, we may be required to make significant cash contributions to these plans and recognize increased expense on our financial statements.\nIncreases in costs of medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability.\nWith approximately 9,790 employees as of November 1, 2018 (which excludes the employees of our unconsolidated subsidiaries), our profitability may be substantially affected by costs of medical and other health and welfare benefits for these employees as well as certain former employees. Although we try to control these costs, they can vary because of changes in health care laws and experience, which have the potential to increase the cost of providing medical and other employee health and welfare benefits. Any substantial increase could negatively affect our profitability.\nTechnology failures, cybersecurity incidents and corruption of our data privacy protections could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store operating and financial information, to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. For example, our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and control costs. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communications between our personnel, customers and suppliers depends on information technology. Some of our information technology needs are outsourced to third parties. Our and our third party vendors\u2019 information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions due to events beyond our or their control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, power outages, computer viruses and malware, hardware or software failures, cybersecurity incidents, hackers and other security issues. Such interruptions could negatively impact our business.\nIf we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes, or if one of our third party service providers fails to provide the services we require, we could be subject to billing and collection errors, business disruptions or damage resulting from such events, particularly material security breaches and cybersecurity incidents. If any of our significant information technology systems suffers severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results. In addition, there is a risk of business interruption, litigation and reputational damage from leaks of confidential or personal information. While we have insurance programs in place related to these matters, the potential liabilities associated with such events, or those that could arise in the future, could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed the coverage provided by such programs. Although we have not detected a material security breach or cybersecurity incident to date, we have been the target of events of this nature and expect them to continue.\nWe also are subject to an evolving body of federal, state and foreign laws, regulations, guidelines and principles regarding data privacy, data protection and data security. A data breach or inability on our part to comply with such laws, regulations, guidelines and principles, or to quickly adapt our practices to reflect them as they develop, could potentially subject us to significant liabilities and reputational harm. Several foreign governments, including the European Union, have laws and regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal information obtained from their data subjects, and we could incur substantial penalties or litigation related to violations of such laws and regulations. In addition, our efforts to comply with such laws and regulations may impose significant costs and challenges on us.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.\nWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, but also our patents, trade secrets, copyrights and licenses, to be a significant and valuable asset of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as exclusive and nonexclusive licensing agreements, third party nondisclosure, confidentiality and assignment agreements and the policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure or inability to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business. In addition, as certain of our trademarks and trade names are subject to nonexclusive licenses and are shared and used by third parties, negative events outside of our control could have an adverse impact on us, our results of operations, our financial condition and our cash flows.\nWe face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend; cause us to cease making, licensing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; require us to redesign or rebrand our products or packaging, if feasible; divert management\u2019s attention and resources; or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property. Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, a successful claim of infringement against us could require us to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements or stop the sale of certain products, any or all of which could have a negative impact on our operating profits and harm our future prospects.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations that can impose significant costs and expose us to potential financial liabilities.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including those limiting the discharge and release of pollutants into the environment and those regulating the transport, storage, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, solid and hazardous wastes. In addition, our Refrigerated Food business is subject to particular federal and state requirements governing animal feeding operations and the management of animal waste. Certain environmental laws and regulations can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault on responsible\nparties, including past and present owners and operators of sites, related to cleaning up sites at which hazardous materials were disposed of or released. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in severe fines and penalties by governments or courts of law. In addition, future laws may more stringently regulate the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide and methane. We cannot predict the impact that such regulation may have, or that climate change may otherwise have, on our business.\nFuture events, such as new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations, new environmental claims, the discovery of currently unknown environmental conditions requiring response action or more vigorous interpretations or enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations, might require us to incur additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nClimate change, or legal or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.\nThere is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. If any of these climate changes has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, including wheat, oats and other grain products, dairy-based proteins, eggs and sows. In addition, increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters may result in damage and disruptions to our manufacturing operations and distribution channels. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more federal, state, local and foreign legal requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. If such laws are enacted, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nFrom time to time, we release guidance regarding our future performance, the future performance of some or all of our unconsolidated subsidiaries or the expected future performance of companies or businesses that we have agreed to acquire. This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in such release and the factors described under \u201cCautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in our current and periodic reports filed with the SEC. Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.\nGuidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, although presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from the guidance. Investors also should recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data is forecast. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the risks or uncertainties set forth in this report could result in actual operating results being different than the guidance, and such differences may be adverse and material.\nIf we are unable to continue to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned, and our stock price may suffer.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d) requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the United States securities laws to perform a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries\u2019 internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures, our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue an opinion on its audit of our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules.\nDuring the course of its testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies which may not be remedied in time to meet the annual deadline imposed by SOX. If our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies material weaknesses in our internal controls, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, and our stock price may consequently suffer. In addition, in the event we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we might fail to timely prevent or detect potential financial misstatements. As of September 30, 2018, management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nActions of shareholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to proposals and other requests from shareholders urging us to take certain corporate actions, including proposals seeking to influence our corporate policies or effecting a change in our management. In the event of such shareholder proposals, particularly with respect to matters which our management and Board of Directors, in exercising their fiduciary duties, disagree with or have determined not to pursue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to actions and requests of shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners and customers.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe have substantial debt and high leverage, which could have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position and which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have a significant amount of debt. We had $7,917.4 million in aggregate principal amount of total debt as of September 30, 2018, which includes $625.0 million borrowed under a bridge loan facility that was assumed by 8th Avenue upon the closing of the transaction involving our historical Private Brands business on October 1, 2018 (the \u201cBridge Loan\u201d) and was classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2018. Additionally, our secured revolving credit facility has borrowing capacity of $781.5 million at September 30, 2018 (all of which would be secured when drawn).\nOur overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, for capital expenditures, for acquisitions, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our financing arrangements;\n\u2022\ntrigger limitations on our ability to deduct interest paid on such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for and to adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we operate and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nsubject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition.\nOur ability to meet expenses and debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including potential changes in consumer preferences, the success of product and marketing innovation and pressure from competitors. If we do not generate enough cash to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise additional equity.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks described above.\nWe may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the financing arrangements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness, as defined in the documents governing our indebtedness.\nThe agreements governing our debt, including the indentures governing our senior notes, contain, or may in future financings contain, various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions and also require us to meet financial maintenance tests, and failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur financing arrangements contain restrictions, covenants and events of default that, among other things, require us to satisfy certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and to refinance our existing indebtedness. Financing arrangements which we enter into in the future could contain similar restrictions and could additionally require us to comply with similar, new or additional financial tests or to maintain similar, new or additional financial ratios. The terms of our financing arrangements, financing arrangements which we enter into in the future and any future indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to pay dividends, respond to market conditions, provide for capital investment needs or take advantage of business opportunities by limiting the amount of additional borrowings we may incur. These restrictions include compliance with, or maintenance of, certain financial tests and ratios and may limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nborrow money or guarantee debt;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\npay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock or other securities;\n\u2022\nmake investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nenter into or permit to exist contractual limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us;\n\u2022\nenter into new lines of business;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nsell assets or merge with other companies.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants. Failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants in our existing or future financing arrangements could result in a default under those arrangements and under other arrangements containing cross-default provisions.\nOur credit agreement contains customary financial covenants, including a covenant requiring us to maintain a senior secured leverage ratio (as defined in our credit agreement) not to exceed 4.25 to 1.00, measured as of the last day of any fiscal quarter if, as of the last day of such fiscal quarter, the aggregate outstanding amount of all revolving credit loans, swing line loans and letter of credit obligations (subject to certain exceptions specified in our credit agreement) exceeds 30% of our revolving credit commitments. Our credit agreement permits us, subject to certain exceptions, to incur additional unsecured debt only if, among other conditions, our pro forma consolidated interest coverage ratio, calculated as provided in our credit agreement, would be greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00 after giving effect to such new debt. The indentures that govern our senior notes, subject to certain exceptions, contain a similar restriction.\nA default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these arrangements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including our obligations under our indentures, credit agreement and convertible preferred stock. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.\nCertain of our subsidiaries may not be subject to the restrictive covenants in our debt.\nWe have designated 8th Avenue and the subsidiaries of 8th Avenue as unrestricted subsidiaries under our credit agreement and senior note indentures. Any subsidiary that is designated as unrestricted is not a guarantor under our credit agreement or under our senior note indentures, and the assets of our unrestricted subsidiaries may not be available to us to pay our obligations on our indebtedness until all of the liabilities of the unrestricted subsidiaries have been paid in full.\nTo service our indebtedness and other cash needs, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to pay interest on our outstanding senior notes, to satisfy our other debt obligations and to fund any planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend in part upon the future financial and operating performance of our subsidiaries and upon our ability to renew or refinance borrowings. Prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, will affect our ability to make these payments.\nIf we are unable to make payments or refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we may consider other options, including:\n\u2022\nsales of assets;\n\u2022\nsales of equity;\n\u2022\nreduction or delay of capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances; or\n\u2022\nnegotiations with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the senior notes and our other debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIncreases in interest rates may negatively affect earnings.\nAs of September 30, 2018, the aggregate principal amount of our debt instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was $2,797.5 million, based on the outstanding debt balance of our term loan and the $625.0 million Bridge Loan, which was classified as held for sale. As a result, higher interest rates will increase the cost of servicing our financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk and could materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. In May 2017, we entered into $1,000.0 million of long-term interest rate swap agreements to lock into a fixed LIBOR rate base, beginning on May 24, 2017 and ending on May 24, 2024. As of September 30, 2018, each one hundred basis points change in LIBOR rates would result in an approximate $18.0 million change in the annual cash interest expense, before any principal payment, on our financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk, including the impact of the $1,000.0 million in interest rate swap agreements.\nWith the closing of the 8th Avenue transaction on October 1, 2018, the Company assigned the $625.0 million Bridge Loan to 8th Avenue, repaid approximately $863.0 million of the Company\u2019s term loan and subsequently terminated $800.0 million of the Company\u2019s related long-term interest rate swap agreements. After giving effect to these transactions, each one hundred basis points change in LIBOR rates would result in an approximate $11.0 million change in the annual cash interest expense, before any principal payment, on our financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nYour percentage ownership in Post may be diluted in the future.\nAs with any publicly traded company, our shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership in Post may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we expect will be granted to our directors, officers and employees and the accelerated vesting of other equity awards. For a more detailed description of our equity incentive plan, see \u201cExecutive Compensation\u201d in Item 11 of this report.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risks and uncertainties discussed in this report or for reasons unrelated to our performance, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions or negative developments relating to our customers, competitors or suppliers, as well as general economic and industry conditions.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Missouri law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation, bylaws and Missouri law contain provisions intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive and incentivizing prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe Board of Directors is divided into three classes with staggered terms;\n\u2022\nthe Board of Directors fixes the number of members on the Board;\n\u2022\nelimination of the rights of our shareholders to act by written consent (except when such consent is unanimous) and to call shareholder meetings;\n\u2022\nrules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval;\n\u2022\nsupermajority vote requirements for certain amendments to our articles of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022\nanti-takeover provisions of Missouri law which may prevent us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder, or which may deter third parties from acquiring amounts of our common stock above certain thresholds; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on the right of shareholders to remove directors.", "PERMNO": 13188, "SIC": 2015, "TIC": "POST"}
