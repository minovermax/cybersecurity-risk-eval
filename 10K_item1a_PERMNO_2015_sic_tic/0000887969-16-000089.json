{"cik": "887969", "company": "MRV COMMUNICATIONS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The Company is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, the outcome of which may impact future results of operations and the Company's financial condition. The risks and uncertainties described below are not all encompassing and should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), as well as news releases and other information we publicly disseminate from time to time. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our Common Stock could decline.\nWe did not achieve profitability on a consolidated basis for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and may not achieve profitability in the future.\nWe did not achieve profitability for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 on a consolidated basis, and we expect to continue to incur significant product development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses, and costs related to improving efficiency in the near term. As a result, we will need to continue our efforts to contain expense levels and increase revenue levels in an effort to achieve profitability in the future. We may not be successful in our efforts to contain expense levels and increase revenue levels, and we may not attain profitability on a sustained basis or at all.\nOur operating results may be adversely impacted by worldwide economic and political uncertainties and specific conditions in the markets we address, including the cyclical nature of and volatility in the network equipment industry.\nOur Network Equipment business is a global business with a significant presence in Europe which is experiencing difficult economic conditions. Such conditions are characterized by decreases in product demand, excess customer inventories, and accelerated price erosion, and may be interspersed with, or followed by, significant and temporary increased demand in products. Further, these markets are cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards. These factors could cause substantial fluctuations in our revenue, gross margins and results of operations, and may cause difficulty in predicting demand and short-term production needs. In addition, during downturns some competitors become more aggressive in their pricing practices, which, if we follow their actions, could adversely impact our product gross margins. Any downturns in the network equipment markets may be severe and prolonged or intermittent, and any failure to fully recover from downturns of these industries or the markets in which we operate could seriously impact our revenue and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The network equipment industries also periodically experience increased demand and production capacity constraints, which may affect our ability to ship products in a timely manner and may cause delivery penalties. Accordingly, our operating results may vary significantly as a result of the general conditions in the network equipment industries, which could cause large fluctuations in our stock price.\nMany other factors have the potential to significantly impact our business, such as concerns about inflation and deflation, deterioration in credit availability due to economic downturns or instability on a local or global level, volatility in energy costs, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns in the communications markets, reduced availability of insurance coverage or reduced ability to pay claims by insurance carriers, international conflicts and terrorist and military activity, and the impact of natural disasters and public health emergencies. These conditions may make it extremely difficult for our customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and they could cause U.S. and foreign businesses to reduce spending on our products and services, which would delay and lengthen sales cycles. Furthermore, during challenging economic times our customers may face issues gaining timely access to sufficient credit or could even need to file for bankruptcy. Either of these circumstances could result in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us. If these circumstances were to occur, we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts. Historically, a portion of our business has not come from the end customer directly, and we have experienced growth patterns that are different than what the end customer demand might be, particularly during periods of high volatility. This can manifest itself in periods of growth in excess of our customers' growth followed by periods of under-shipment before the volatility abates as our customers adjust their inventory levels. Given recent economic conditions it is possible that any correlation will continue to be less predictable and will result in increased volatility in our operating results and stock price. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or recovery, worldwide, in the network equipment industry or in the markets in which we operate. If the economy or the markets in which we operate deviate from present levels or deteriorate, we may record additional charges related to restructuring costs and the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. The impact of market volatility is not limited to revenue but may also affect our product gross margins and other financial metrics.\nA few customers account for a substantial portion of our sales, increasing both our dependence on a few revenue sources and the risk that our operations will suffer materially if a significant customer stops ordering from us or substantially reduces its business with us.\nRevenue from two customers accounted for 31%, 23% and 20% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, amounts due from one of those customers accounted for 15% and 22% of our consolidated gross accounts receivables, respectively. While our financial performance benefited from substantial sales to these customers, because of the magnitude of sales to these customers, our results would suffer if we were to lose their business. Additionally, if those customers, or other significant customers, made substantial reductions in order volume or stopped paying their invoices when due, our results of operations would suffer unless we were able to replace the orders or collect on the payments due. Both customers are major telecom companies, one operating in Australia and one in North America.\nOur quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuations, and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future performance. Our operating results could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nOur operating results for a particular quarter are difficult to predict. Our revenue, gross margins and operating results could fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter and from year to year as a whole. This could result from any one or a combination of factors such as:\n\u2022\nthe cancellation or postponement of orders from one period to the next;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of significant orders;\n\u2022\nthe mix in any period of higher and lower margin products and services;\n\u2022\nsoftware, hardware or other errors in the products we sell requiring replacements or increased warranty reserves;\n\u2022\ncharges for excess or obsolete inventory;\n\u2022\nour annual reviews of other intangibles that may lead to impairment charges;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our suppliers to produce and deliver components and parts, including sole or limited source components, in a timely manner, in the quantity and quality desired and at the prices we have budgeted;\n\u2022\npolitical stability in the areas of the world in which we operate;\n\u2022\nprice reductions that we make, such as marketing decisions that we have made in the past to reduce the price for our products in an effort to secure new customers or to provide competitive bulk discounts;\n\u2022\ndecreases in average selling prices of our products which result from factors such as overcapacity and market conditions, the introduction of new and more technologically advanced products, and increased sales discounts;\n\u2022\nthe relative success of our efforts to continually reduce product manufacturing costs;\n\u2022\nour introduction of new products, with initial sales at relatively small volumes with resulting higher production costs, and the rate of market acceptance of the products;\n\u2022\ndelays or reductions in customer purchases of our products in anticipation of the introduction of new and enhanced products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing of capital spending of our customers;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our customers to pay for our products;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nchanges in conditions specific to our business.\nMoreover, the volume and timing of orders we receive during a quarter are difficult to forecast. Customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision. As a result, customers typically expend significant effort in evaluating, testing and qualifying our products. This customer evaluation and qualification process frequently results in a lengthy initial sales cycle of up to one year or more. We may also expend significant management effort and order long lead-time components or materials prior to receiving an order. Further, our customers encounter uncertain and changing demand for their products. Customers generally order based on their forecasts. If demand falls below these forecasts or if customers do not control inventories effectively, they may cancel or reschedule shipments previously ordered from us even after acceptance of orders. We do not recognize revenue until a product has been shipped to a customer, all significant vendor obligations have been performed, and collection is considered reasonably assured. Our expense levels during any particular period are based, in part, on expectations of future sales. If sales in a particular quarter do not meet expectations, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe expect revenue and gross margins generally and for specific products and services to continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year. Changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services, as well as the timing of support service contract initiations and renewals. It is possible that, in future periods, our results of operations will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. This failure to meet expectations could cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline. Similarly, the failure by our competitors or customers to meet or exceed the results expected by their analysts or investors could, by association, cause our stock price to decline.\nChanges in the seasonality of our business could cause our operating results to fluctuate.\nSales of our products are subject to seasonality. However, the current global economic environment may impact typical seasonal trends, making it more difficult for us to forecast our business. Changes in the product or channel mix of our business can also impact seasonal patterns, adding to complexity in forecasting demand. If our forecasts are inaccurate, we may lose market share or procure excess inventory or inappropriately increase or decrease our operating expenses, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Changes in seasonality may also lead to greater volatility in our stock price.\nWe are making significant investments in engineering and product and software development. These investments will negatively affect our short-term operating results, and may achieve delayed, or lower than expected, benefits which could harm our long-term operating results.\nWhile we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, the investments in engineering and development will impact our short-term operating results, as we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our long-term operating results may be adversely affected.\nCompetition is ever increasing, and we face additional challenges when entering into new markets which could reduce our revenue and gross margins or cause us to lose market share.\nThe network equipment industry is intensely competitive, and we must continually compete against new products from larger, better capitalized global competitors while we must also compete against aggressive pricing from low-cost producers in Asia and elsewhere.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, sales and customer support organizations and other resources and larger installed customer bases than we have. Our competitors continually introduce new competitive products, and may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. Moreover, recent consolidation in our markets may enhance these competitive advantages of some of our competitors. They may also be able to leverage their buying power with vendors to give them preferential treatment in delivery of high-demand products in times of supply constraint. Many of our larger competitors offer customers broader product lines, which provide a more comprehensive networking solution than we provide. These companies can leverage their customer bases and broader product offerings and adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share. In addition, several of our competitors have large market capitalizations, have substantially larger cash reserves, and are much better positioned than we are to acquire other companies in order to gain new technologies or products that may displace our product lines and give them a strategic advantage. Accordingly, in certain regional markets we have collaborated with other vendors in an effort to enhance our overall capability in providing products and services, and we focus on consolidating our purchasing programs globally to improve purchasing power with vendors.\nAdditional competitors may enter the market from regions of the world, including China, which offer lower labor costs as well as government incentives that may not be available to MRV. As a result of such advantages, such companies may threaten our business with products that are more competitively priced, have increased performance or functionality, or incorporate technological advances that we have not yet developed or implemented, and may be able to react more quickly to changing customer requirements and expectations. There is also the risk that other network system vendors may enter or re-enter the subsystem market and begin to manufacture in-house the networking subsystems incorporated into their network systems. We also expect to encounter potential customers that, because of existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to the products offered by these competitors. As a result of the foregoing factors, we expect that competitive pressures may result in price reductions, reduced or negative margins or loss of market share in our markets.\nOur markets are subject to rapid technological change, and to compete effectively, we must continually introduce new products that achieve market acceptance.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. We expect that new technologies will emerge as competition and the need for higher and more cost effective transmission capacity, or bandwidth, increases. Our future performance will depend on the successful development of new and enhanced products that address these changes and other customer requirements. The introduction of new and enhanced products may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for existing products. We have in the past experienced delays in product development and these delays may occur in the future. Therefore, to the extent that customers defer or cancel orders in the expectation of a new product release or there is any delay in development or introduction of our new products or enhancements of our products, our operating results could suffer.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, product development and engineering expenses accounted for 23% and 24% of revenue, respectively. In 2016, we are investing further in our engineering staff and the development of our product lines, and expect this expense to increase. Introduction of new products and product enhancements will require that we effectively transfer production processes from development to manufacturing and coordinate our efforts with those of our manufacturers and suppliers to achieve volume production rapidly. If we fail to transfer production processes effectively, develop product enhancements or introduce new products in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of our customers as scheduled, our net sales may be reduced and our business may be harmed. We also may not be able to develop the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and enhancements, or to license these technologies from third parties. Product development delays may result from numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanging product specifications and customer requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in hiring and retaining necessary technical personnel;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties with contract manufacturers;\n\u2022\nchanging market or competitive product requirements; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated engineering complexities.\nThe development of new, technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. In order to compete, we must be able to deliver to customers products that are highly reliable, operate with their existing equipment, lower their costs of acquisition, installation and maintenance, and provide an overall cost-effective solution. We may not be able to identify, develop, manufacture, market or support new or enhanced products successfully, if at all, or on a timely basis. Further, our new products may not gain market acceptance or we may not be able to respond effectively to product announcements by competitors, technological changes or emerging industry standards. Our failure to respond effectively to technological changes could significantly harm our business.\nOur products are deployed in large and complex systems and may contain defects that are not detected until after our products have been installed, which may cause us to incur significant costs, divert our attention from product development efforts, or damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers.\nOur products are complex and undergo internal quality testing and qualification as well as formal qualification by our customers. However, defects may be found from time to time. Our customers' testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios and over varying amounts of time. For various reasons, including the occurrence of performance problems that are unforeseeable in testing or that are detected only when products age or are operated under peak stress conditions, our products may fail to perform as expected long after customer acceptance. Failures could result from faulty components or design, problems in manufacturing or other unforeseen reasons. As a result, we could incur significant costs to repair and/or replace defective products under warranty, particularly when such failures occur in installed systems. We have experienced such failures in the past and will continue to face this risk going forward, as our products are widely deployed throughout the world in multiple demanding environments and applications. In addition, we may in certain circumstances honor warranty claims after the warranty period has expired or for problems not covered by warranty in order to maintain customer relationships. We believe that our warranty reserves adequately address our potential exposure to liability for warranty claims. Our warranty reserves are based on historical return rates, and our average material costs incurred to repair items, including labor costs. The warranty reserves are evaluated and adjusted based on actual experience.\nIn addition, certain of our networking products are typically embedded in, or deployed in conjunction with, our customers' products, which incorporate a variety of components and may be expected to interoperate with modules produced by third parties. As a result, not all defects are immediately detectable and when problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. These problems may cause us to incur significant damages or warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts, cause significant customer relation problems or loss of customers, and harm our reputation and brand, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur customers may adopt alternate technologies for which we do not produce products or for which our products are not adaptable.\nThe market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and new product introductions, which may minimize the demand for our existing products or render them obsolete. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and to develop and introduce new products that address such changes in technology and standards and respond to our customers' potential desire to adopt such technologies in place of those supported by our current product offerings. The development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends as well as precise technological execution. Further, the development cycle for products integrating new technologies or technologies with which we are not as familiar may be longer and more costly than our current product development process. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of these new products, and the new products may not be successfully commercialized. These costs and delays may prevent us from being able to establish a market position with respect to such new technologies and industry standards or be as responsive as we would like to be in meeting our customers' demands for such products, thus adversely affecting our results of operations and our customer relationships.\nWe do not have many long-term volume purchase contracts with our customers, so our customers may increase, decrease, cancel or delay their purchasing levels at any time with minimal advance notice to us, which may significantly harm our business.\nOur customers typically purchase our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. While our customers generally provide us with their demand forecasts, in most cases they are not contractually committed to buy any quantity of products beyond firm purchase orders. Our customers may increase, decrease, cancel or delay purchase orders already in place. If any of our major customers decrease, stop or delay purchasing our products for any reason, our business and results of operations would be harmed. Cancellation or delays of such orders may cause us to fail to achieve our short- and long-term financial and operating goals. Lead times for components and materials that we order vary significantly and depend on factors including the specific supplier requirements, the size of the order, contract terms and current market demand for components. For substantial increases in our sales levels, some of our suppliers may need significant lead time. In the past, during periods of market downturns, certain of our largest customers canceled or delayed significant orders with us and with our competitors, which resulted in losses of sales and excess and obsolete inventory. Similarly, decreases or deferrals of purchases by our customers may significantly harm our industry and specifically our business in these and in additional unforeseen ways, particularly if they are not anticipated.\nWe may suffer losses as a result of entering into fixed price contracts.\nFrom time to time we enter into contracts with certain customers in which the price we charge for particular products is fixed. Although our estimated production costs for these products are used to compute fixed sales prices, if actual production costs exceed the estimated production costs because of our inability to obtain needed components timely, or at all, or we cannot continue to cut costs in production and have incrementally decreased future fixed prices, we may incur a loss on the sale. Sales of material amounts of products on a fixed price basis, for which we have not accurately forecast the production costs, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThere are a limited number of potential source suppliers for certain components, which makes us susceptible to supply shortages.\nWe currently purchase several key components from single or limited sources. Moreover, we depend on the quality of the products supplied to us, over which we have limited control. We have encountered shortages and delays in obtaining components in the past and expect to encounter shortages and delays in the future. Sudden significant increases in demand for products that we purchase may cause delays in delivery of subcomponents, which may cause delay in delivery of our products. Larger competitors may be able to demand more rapid delivery of components parts in comparison to us. If we cannot supply products due to a lack of certain components or are unable to redesign products with other components in a timely manner, our business will be significantly harmed.\nWe typically have not entered into long-term agreements with our suppliers and, therefore, our suppliers could stop supplying materials and equipment at any time or fail to supply adequate quantities of component parts on a timely basis. It is difficult, costly, time consuming and, on short notice, sometimes impossible for us to identify and qualify new component suppliers. The reliance on a sole supplier, single qualified vendor or limited number of suppliers could result in delivery and quality problems, reduced control over product pricing, reliability and performance. We may have difficulty in identifying and qualifying another supplier in a timely manner. We have in the past had to change suppliers, which, in some instances, resulted in delays in product development and manufacturing until another supplier was found and qualified. Any such delays in the future may limit our ability to respond to changes in customer and market demands. During the last several years, the number of suppliers of components has decreased significantly and, more recently, demand for components has increased. Any supply deficiencies relating to the quality or quantities of components we use to manufacture our products could adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and our results of operations.\nWe rely substantially upon a limited number of contract manufacturing partners, and if these contract manufacturers fail to meet our short- and long-term needs and contractual obligations, our business may be negatively impacted.\nWe rely to a significant extent on a limited number of contract manufacturers to, manufacture, assemble, test and in certain cases ship our products to our customers directly. The qualification and set up of these independent manufacturers under quality assurance standards is an expensive and time-consuming process. Our reliance upon third party manufacturers could expose us to increased risks related to lead times, continuity of supply, on-time delivery, quality assurance, and compliance with environmental standards and other regulations. Reliance upon third party manufacturers also exposes us to significant risks related to their operations, financial position, business continuity, sourcing relationships and labor relationships that may affect their manufacturing of our products including their continued viability. Product manufacturing with our contract manufacturing partners principally takes place in the United States, Israel and Canada. Significant disruptions in these and other countries where our products or key components are manufactured, including natural disasters, epidemics, acts of war or terrorism, social or political unrest or work stoppages, could affect the cost, availability or allocation of supply and manufacturing capacity and negatively affect our business and results of operations. As a result, we may lose existing or potential customers or orders and our business may be negatively impacted.\nIf we fail to forecast component and material requirements accurately, we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays.\nWe use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our component and material requirements. It is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials. Lead times for components and materials that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as specific supplier requirements, the size of the order, contract terms and current market demand for the components. For substantial increases in production levels, some suppliers may need six months or more lead time. If we overestimate our component and material requirements, we may have excess or obsolete inventory, which may not get used or have to be discounted to eliminate. If we underestimate our component and material requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt our manufacturing and delay delivery of our products to our customers. Any of these occurrences could negatively impact our business.\nChanges in key management and loss of highly qualified personnel could negatively affect our business.\nOur ability to run our operations, develop, manufacture and market our products, and compete with our current and future competitors depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. The loss or unavailability of any of our key personnel, which includes our executive officers, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. We have had a succession of chief executive officers and other executive management in the recent past, and maintaining consistency and providing structure and reliability to the Company's employees and our customers and vendors will be important for the Company's ability to produce reliable financial results. We are dependent upon our management team, especially in places where personal relationships are a significant part of a business transaction. We do not have succession plans in every key position, and the loss of the services of these officers could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Further, competition for highly-qualified engineers in the network equipment and integration industries is intense, and we will be required to compete for those personnel with companies having substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. If we do not attract and retain necessary team members to operate our business and build our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business and future operating results are subject to a wide range of uncertainties arising out of the international nature of our operations and facilities that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nExternal revenues from foreign subsidiaries accounted for 24%, 26% and 28% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.\nWe have offices and facilities in, and conduct a significant portion of our operations in Israel. We are, therefore, influenced by the political and economic conditions affecting that country. Risks we face from international sales and our use of facilities and suppliers overseas for manufacturing include:\n\u2022\nensuring compliance with local regulations and laws in each country and locality in which we do business;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;\n\u2022\nthe impact of recessions in economies outside the United States;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nseasonal reductions in business activities in some parts of the world, such as during the summer months in Europe;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas;\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nthe payment of operating expenses in local currencies, which exposes us to risks of currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nhigher credit risks requiring cash in advance or letters of credit;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, increasing taxes, and heightened efforts by officials of foreign countries to increase revenue from tax collection;\n\u2022\nunavailability or delays in delivery of equipment, raw materials or key components;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions, tariff increases and increasing import-export duties;\n\u2022\nshipping delays;\n\u2022\nlimited protection of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ntightening immigration controls that may adversely affect our ability to hire new non-U.S. employees in our U.S. facilities; and\n\u2022\nincreasing foreign environmental regulation or unforeseen environmental problems.\nOur business and operations are also subject to general geopolitical conditions, such as terrorism, political and economic instability, changes in the costs of key resources such as crude oil and changes in diplomatic or trade relationships. Economic conditions in several countries and markets outside the United States in which we have offices, personnel, facilities or sales represent significant risks to us. Instability in the Middle East, China or the European Union could have a negative impact on our sales and operations in these regions, and unstable conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition to the effect of global economic instability on our operations or facilities on sales to customers outside the United States, sales to domestic customers could be negatively impacted by these conditions.\nOur ability to utilize our NOLs and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2015, MRV had net operating losses (\"NOLs\") of $182.5 million, $97.1 million and $97.4 million, for federal, state and foreign income tax purposes, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company utilized capital loss carryforwards of $11.7 million and $3.0 million for federal and state tax purposes, respectively, primarily to offset the gains realized on the sale of Tecnonet. The unutilized capital loss carryforwards of $98.8 million and $21.0 million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively, expired on December 31, 2015. Under the Internal Revenue Code, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change,\" the corporation's ability to use its pre-change NOLs, capital loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. An ownership change is generally defined as a greater than 50% change in equity ownership over a three-year period. We may experience an ownership change in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. If we were to trigger an ownership change in the future, our ability to use any NOLs and capital loss carryforwards existing at that time could be limited. As of December 31, 2015, the US federal and state NOLs had a full valuation allowance.\nOur business and future operating results may be adversely affected by events outside of our control.\nWe use our facilities in California, Massachusetts and Israel for major product design and development and customer support, and we manufacture products through third-party manufacturers in California, Israel, Taiwan and Canada. The risk of earthquakes in Southern California is significant because of the proximity of these manufacturing facilities to major earthquake fault lines. In January 1994, major earthquakes near Chatsworth, California affected our facilities, causing power and communications outages and disruptions that impaired production capacity. While our facility did not suffer material damage and our business was not materially disrupted by this earthquake, the occurrence of an earthquake or other natural disaster could result in the disruption of our manufacturing facilities. Any disruption in our manufacturing facilities arising from earthquakes, other natural disasters or other catastrophic events including fire, excessive rain, terrorist attacks and wars, could disrupt our manufacturing ability, which could harm our operations and financial results, and could cause significant delays in the production or shipment of our products until we are able to shift production to different facilities or arrange for third parties to manufacture our products. We may not be able to obtain alternate capacity on favorable terms or at all. The location of our manufacturing facilities subjects us to increased risk that a natural disaster could disrupt our operations.\nAlthough we believe our insurance coverage is adequate to address the variety of potential liabilities we face, our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and coverage limits. Upon an occurrence of a significant natural disaster, or manmade problems such as computer viruses, civil war, terrorism, blackout or disruptions to the economies of the United States and other countries, such coverage may not be adequate or continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms. In the event of a major earthquake or other disaster affecting one or more of our facilities, our operations could be significantly disrupted, delayed or prevented for the time required to transfer production, repair, rebuild or replace the affected manufacturing facilities. This time frame could be lengthy, and result in significant expenses for repair and related costs. In addition, concerns about an outbreak of epidemic diseases such as avian or swine influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome, could have a negative effect on travel and our business operations, and result in adverse consequences to our business and results of operations.\nEnvironmental regulations applicable to our manufacturing operations could limit our ability to expand or subject us to substantial costs. Compliance with current and future environmental regulations may be costly which could impact our future operating results.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our development processes, as are the third parties who manufacture our products. Further, we are subject to other safety, labeling and training regulations as required by foreign, local, state and federal law. We believe we are compliant in all material respects with applicable environmental regulations in the United States, Taiwan and Israel. However, any failure by us or our contract manufacturers to comply with present and future regulations could subject us to future liabilities or the suspension of production. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities and we may need to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations. We cannot provide assurance that legal requirements will not be imposed on us that would require additional capital expenditures or the satisfaction of other requirements. If we fail to obtain required permits or make adequate reporting submissions, or otherwise fail to operate within current or future legal requirements, including those applicable to us in the countries in which we manufacture our products, we may be required to pay substantial penalties, suspend our operations, or make costly changes to our development processes or facilities.\nIn addition, we could face significant costs and liabilities in connection with legislation which enables customers to return a product at the end of its useful life and charges us with financial and other responsibility for environmentally safe collection, recycling, treatment and disposal. We also face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and upcoming requirements relating to the materials composition of our products, and disclosure related to the origin of certain raw materials used in our products. This includes the restrictions on lead and certain other substances in electronics that apply to specified electronics products put on the market in the European Union and the PRC. Many of our customers have adopted this approach and have required our full compliance. Even though we have devoted a significant amount of resources and effort planning and executing our compliance program and believe that we are in compliance with such legislation, it is possible that some of our products might be incompatible with such regulations. In such event, we could experience loss of revenue, damaged reputation, diversion of resources, monetary penalties and legal action. Other environmental regulations may require us to re-engineer our products to utilize components that are more environmentally compatible. Such re-engineering and component substitution may result in additional costs to us. Although we currently do not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of our operations and the effect of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on us.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, the Company is required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB. It is possible that future changes the Company is required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that the Company applies to its consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nNew regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted disclosure rules regarding a company\u2019s use of conflict minerals in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements in the event that the conflict minerals come from, or could have come from the DRC or adjoining countries. These rules and verification requirements will impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict-free, we may face challenges with customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage and could harm our reputation.\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\nWe rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business. We implemented an enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system in 2013 that allows the financial and other business functions to interact and scale to support the growth of our business. The continued integration of the ERP system into our business can be costly and imposes substantial demands on management's time, and may be disruptive to our operations. Further, it may require changes in our other information systems, modification of internal control procedures and training of employees or third party resources. Our information technology systems, and those of third party providers, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control. These include catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, viruses or malware, physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized access and cyber-attacks affecting our systems or those of third party business partners. Any material disruption, malfunction or similar challenges with our business processes or information systems, or disruptions or challenges relating to the transition to new processes, systems or providers, could have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business and our results of operations.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to compete.\nWe rely on a combination of trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure and patents, copyrights and trademarks to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be sure that our pending patent and trademark applications will be approved, that any patents or trademarks that may be issued will protect our intellectual property or that third parties will not challenge any issued patents. Other parties may independently develop similar or competing technology or design around any patents that may be issued to us. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Specifically there is a risk of poor enforcement of intellectual property rights in China, where the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property is uncertain and still evolving. Policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive. Reverse engineering, unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technologies could enable competitors, especially in the China, to benefit from our technologies without paying us any royalties. Enforcing our intellectual property rights or resolving intellectual property disputes may involve litigation. Any of this kind of litigation, regardless of outcome, could be expensive and time consuming, and adverse determinations in any of this kind of litigation could seriously harm our business.\nWe are involved in intellectual property disputes from time to time as part of doing business in the network equipment industry, which could divert management's attention, cause us to incur significant costs, and prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology.\nParticipants in the network equipment markets in which we sell our products have experienced litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Numerous patents in these industries are held by others, including our competitors. From time to time, we have become aware of the possibility or have been notified that we may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others, and we have been involved in litigation matters regarding intellectual property right claims of others in the past. In addition, we may be a party to litigation to protect our intellectual property. These claims and any resulting lawsuits, if successful, could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidation of our proprietary rights, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our defense and, even if we are successful, we may incur substantial legal fees and other costs in defending such lawsuits. Any lawsuit that we may become party to, regardless of its success, may be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and divert technical and management time and attention. Accordingly, any infringement claim or litigation against us could significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In the event of an adverse result in any litigation with respect to intellectual property rights relevant to our products, we could be required to obtain licenses to the infringing technology, to pay substantial damages under applicable law, to cease the manufacture, use and sale of infringing products, or to expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology. Licenses may not be available from third parties either on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nData breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information and cause significant damage to our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our networks, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation. We believe that companies in the technology industry have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. Our network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. In some cases, it is difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused thereby. These data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information, could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. Cyber-attacks could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense, or cause significant harm to our reputation.\nWe are involved in other lawsuits and legal proceedings, which, if determined against us, could require us to pay substantial damages, fines and/or penalties.\nWe are involved in various lawsuits, disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These suits or actions may raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against us could include product liability, commercial, intellectual property, customer, employment and securities related claims, including class action lawsuits. Plaintiffs (or defendants who counterclaim) may seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Although we carry product liability and other insurance, and believe such coverage is adequate based on the historical rate and nature of customer product quality claims or complaints, we cannot provide assurance that this insurance would adequately cover our costs arising from any significant defects in our products. Adverse results to any lawsuits, disputes or claims may harm our business and have material adverse effects on our results of operations, liquidity or financial position, any or all of which could adversely affect our stock price.\nFailure to achieve and maintain internal controls in accordance with Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nWe have examined and evaluated our internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and identified no material weaknesses. We previously identified two material weaknesses during the year ended December 31, 2014, which were remediated in 2015.\nWe cannot assure you that we will not discover other material weaknesses in the future. If we fail to maintain the internal controls we implemented, or fail to implement required new or improved controls, as such control standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, or as our business changes, we may fail to meet our annual or periodic reporting obligations and there may be material misstatements in our financial statements, and substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify these or other internal control deficiencies. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in the prevention of financial fraud. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors may lose further confidence in our reported financial information, there could be investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities or litigation and there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nThe Company's disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all acts of fraud.\nThe Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management and is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. The Company\u2019s management believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by an unauthorized override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and the Company cannot ensure that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the U.K. Bribery Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. We could suffer losses from corrupt or fraudulent business practices.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), and potentially the U.K. Bribery Act, each of which generally prohibits companies from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, we are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent our transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, are not subject to these prohibitions, and therefore may have a competitive advantage over us. We have implemented and maintained preventative measures and policies, but cannot assure that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct and render us responsible under the FCPA. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in these practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Rights Plan, Delaware law and our ability to issue additional preferred stock may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nOn January 26, 2016, the Board approved the adoption of a \"Rights Plan\" in an effort to protect the Company\nfrom potential adverse consequences arising under the Internal Revenue Code, such adverse consequences\nincluding a significant reduction in the annual utilization of the Company\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards and built-in losses and the impairment or loss of the NOLs and built-in losses prior to their use. While the Rights Plan is intended to reduce the risk of an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382, and thereby preserve the current ability of the Company to utilize NOLs, the Rights Plan could have certain anti-takeover effects. The Rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group acquiring 4.99% or more of our outstanding common stock on terms not approved by the Board.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock. This Preferred Stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by our Board of Directors without further action by stockholders. The terms of any series of preferred stock may include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividend, liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. No preferred stock is currently outstanding. The issuance of any preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of the holders of our Common Stock, and therefore reduce the value of our Common Stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell our assets to, a third party and thereby preserve control by the present management. We are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibit us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless the business combination is approved in the manner prescribed under Section 203. These provisions of Delaware law also may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us, which may cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline.\nOur largest stockholder may be able to exert significant influence over key corporate actions requiring a stockholder vote.\nAt March 3, 2016, the Company\u2019s largest stockholder, Raging Capital, beneficially owned approximately 31% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock and had two representatives - Kenneth H. Traub and Brian J. Bellinger - on the Board of Directors. Raging Capital's significant ownership of the Company and its representation on the Board of Directors may allow Raging Capital to exert significant influence over corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the following actions:\n\u2022\nto elect or defeat the election of the Company\u2019s directors;\n\u2022\nto amend or prevent amendment of the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws;\n\u2022\nto effect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and\n\u2022\nto control the outcome of any other matter submitted to the Company\u2019s stockholders for vote.\nRaging Capital's ownership may also discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company, which in turn could reduce the Company\u2019s stock price or prevent the Company\u2019s stockholders from realizing a premium over the Company\u2019s stock price.\nBecause this Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements, it may not prove to be accurate.\nThis Form 10-K and other Company releases and filings with the SEC may contain forward-looking statements. Words such as \"anticipate,\" \"appear,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"plan,\" \"project,\" \"contemplate,\" \"target,\" \"foresee,\" \"goal,\" \"likely,\" \"will,\" and \"would\" or variations of such words and similar expressions, are intended to identify such forward-looking statements which are not statements of historical facts. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance nor guarantees that the events anticipated will occur or expected conditions will remain the same or improve. These statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the likelihood of which are difficult to assess and may not occur, including risks that each of its business units may not make the expected progress in its respective market, or that management's long-term strategy may not achieve the expected results. Therefore, actual outcomes, performance and results may differ from what is expressed or forecast in such forward-looking statements, and such differences may vary materially from current expectations. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements or risk factors to reflect future events or circumstances.", "PERMNO": 78179, "SIC": 3661, "TIC": "MRVC"}
