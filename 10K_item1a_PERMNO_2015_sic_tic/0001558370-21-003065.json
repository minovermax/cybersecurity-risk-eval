Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report, the following factors and other considerations should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic Has Significantly Impacted Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\"COVID-19\") pandemic has adversely affected us and our customers, employees and third-party service providers, and the adverse impacts on our business, financial position, operations and prospects could be significant.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity in the United States and globally. Governmental responses to the pandemic have included orders closing businesses not deemed essential and directing individuals to restrict their movements and observe social distancing. These actions, together with responses to the pandemic by businesses and individuals, have resulted in reduced commercial and consumer activity, temporary and potentially permanent closures of many businesses that have led to loss of revenues and increased unemployment, material decreases in oil and gas prices and in business valuations, disrupted global supply chains changes in consumer behavior related to pandemic fears, related emergency response legislation and an expectation that Federal Reserve policy will maintain a low interest rate environment for the foreseeable future. These changes have a significant adverse effect on the regions and markets in which we conduct our business and the demand for our products and services.\nBusiness and consumer customers of Flushing Bank are experiencing varying degrees of financial distress, which has adversely affected the ability of some of them to timely pay interest and principal on their loans and the value of the collateral securing their obligations. This in turn has influenced the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and has impacted our allowance for credit losses, particularly as businesses remain closed and as some customers draw on their lines of credit or seek additional loans. These developments as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic materially impact our business and the businesses of our customers and are expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial results for 2021.\nIn order to protect the health of our customers and employees, and to comply with applicable government directives, we have modified our business practices, including restricting employee travel, directing employees to work from home insofar as is possible, reducing in-person meetings and implementing business continuity plans and protocols to the extent appropriate.\nWe may take further such actions that we determine are in the best interest of our employees, customers and communities or as may be required by government order. These actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and similar actions by our vendors and business partners, have not materially impaired our ability to support our employees, conduct our business and serve our customers, but there is no assurance that these actions will be sufficient to successfully mitigate the risks presented by COVID-19 or that our ability to operate will not be materially affected going forward. For instance, our business operations may be disrupted if key personnel or significant portions of our employees are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, if any of our vendors or business partners become unable to continue to provide their products and services, which we rely upon to maintain our day-to-day operations, our ability to serve our customers could be impacted.\nAlthough vaccine programs addressing COVID-19 have commenced, it is not possible to accurately predict when or the extent to which normal economic and operating conditions will resume. For this reason, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affects our business, operations and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios and credit ratings, is uncertain and unpredictable and depends on, among other things, new information that may emerge\nconcerning the scope, duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other parties in response to the pandemic. If the pandemic is prolonged, the adverse impact on the markets in which we operate and on our business, operations and financial condition could deepen. Particular concerns referenced above include:\nCredit Risk. Our risks of timely loan repayment and the value of collateral supporting the loans are affected by the strength of our borrower\u2019s business. Concern about COVID-19 has caused and may continue to cause business shutdowns, limitations on commercial activity and financial transactions, labor shortages, supply chain interruptions, increased unemployment and commercial property vacancy rates, reduced profitability and ability for property owners to make mortgage payments, and overall economic and financial market instability, all of which may cause our customers to be unable to make scheduled loan payments. If the effects of COVID-19 result in widespread and sustained repayment shortfalls on loans in our portfolio, we could incur significant delinquencies, foreclosures and credit losses, particularly if the available collateral is insufficient to cover our exposure. The future effects of COVID-19 on economic activity could negatively affect the collateral values associated with our existing loans, the ability to liquidate the real estate collateral securing our residential and commercial real estate loans, our ability to maintain loan origination volume and to obtain additional financing, the future demand for or profitability of our lending and services, and the financial condition and credit risk of our customers. Further, in the event of delinquencies, regulatory changes and policies designed to protect borrowers may slow or prevent us from making our business decisions or may result in a delay in our taking certain remediation actions, such as foreclosure. Furthermore, in an effort to support our communities during the pandemic, we have participated in the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) under the CARES Act whereby loans to small businesses were made and those loans are subject to the regulatory requirements that could require forbearance of loan payments for a specified time or that would limit our ability to pursue all available remedies in the event of a loan default. If the borrower under a PPP loan fails to qualify for loan forgiveness, we are at the heightened risk of holding that loan at unfavorable interest rates as compared to the loans to customers that we would have otherwise extended credit.\nStrategic Risk. Our success may be affected by a variety of external factors that may affect the price or marketability of our products and services, changes in interest rates that may increase our funding costs, reduced demand for our financial products due to economic conditions and the various response of governmental and nongovernmental authorities. During its course, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased economic and demand uncertainty. Furthermore, many of the governmental actions have been directed toward curtailing household and business activity to contain COVID-19.\nOperational Risk. Current and future restrictions on our workforce\u2019s access to our facilities could limit our ability to meet customer servicing expectations and have a material adverse effect on our operations. We rely on business processes and branch activity that largely depend on people and technology, including access to information technology systems as well as information, applications, payment systems and other services provided by third parties. In response to COVID-19, we have modified our business practices with a portion of our employees working remotely from their homes to have our operations uninterrupted as much as possible. Further, technology in employees\u2019 homes may not be as robust as in our offices and could cause the networks, information systems, applications, and other tools available to employees to be more limited or less reliable than in our offices. The continuation of these work-from-home measures also introduces additional operational risk, including increased cybersecurity risk. These cyber risks include greater phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, vulnerability to disruptions of our information technology infrastructure and telecommunications systems for remote operations, increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of confidential information, limited ability to restore the systems in the event of a systems failure or interruption, greater risk of a security breach resulting in destruction or misuse of valuable information, and potential impairment of our ability to perform critical functions, including wiring funds, all of which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and the operations of any impacted customers.\nChanges in Interest Rates May Significantly Impact Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income generated by our interest-earning assets (consisting primarily of multi-family residential loans, commercial business loans and commercial real estate mortgage loans) and the interest expense generated by our interest-bearing liabilities (consisting primarily of deposits). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of our interest-earning\nassets, the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities, and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by such external factors as the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board (the \u201cFOMC\u201d), and market interest rates. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to a range from 0 to 0.25 percent, citing concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on markets and stress in the energy sector. A significant portion of our loans have fixed interest rates (or, if adjustable, are initially fixed for periods of five to 10 years) and longer terms than our deposits and borrowings. Our net interest income could be adversely affected if the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings increase more rapidly than the rates we earn on loans. Our interest rate risk is exacerbated in the short term by the fact that approximately 81% of our certificates of deposit accounts and borrowings will reprice or mature during the next year.\nAs a result of our historical focus on the origination of multifamily residential mortgage loans, commercial business loans and commercial real estate mortgage loans, the majority of our loans are adjustable rate, however, many adjust at periods of five to 10 years. In addition, a large percentage of our investment securities and mortgage-backed securities have fixed interest rates and are classified as available for sale. As is the case with many financial institutions, our emphasis on increasing the development of core deposits, those with no stated maturity date, has resulted in our interest-bearing liabilities having a shorter duration than our assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because interest rates change over time and are currently at historical low levels. As interest rates increase, our cost of funds will increase more rapidly than the yields on the bulk of our interest-earning assets. In addition, the market value of our fixed-rate assets for example, our investment and mortgage-backed securities portfolios, would decline if interest rates increase. In line with the foregoing, we have experienced and may continue to experience an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities primarily due to raising the rates we pay on some of our deposit products to stay competitive within our market and an increase in borrowing costs from increases in the federal funds rate.\nPrevailing interest rates also affect the extent to which borrowers repay and refinance loans. In a declining interest rate environment, the number of loan prepayments and loan refinancing may increase, as well as prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. Call provisions associated with our investment in U.S. government agency and corporate securities may also adversely affect yield in a declining interest rate environment. Such prepayments and calls may adversely affect the yield of our loan portfolio and mortgage-backed and other securities as we reinvest the prepaid funds in a lower interest rate environment. However, we typically receive additional loan fees when existing loans are refinanced, which partially offset the reduced yield on our loan portfolio resulting from prepayments. In periods of low interest rates, our level of core deposits also may decline if depositors seek higher-yielding instruments or other investments not offered by us, which in turn may increase our cost of funds and decrease our net interest margin to the extent alternative funding sources are utilized. An increasing interest rate environment would tend to extend the average lives of lower yielding fixed rate mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, which could adversely affect net interest income. Also, in an increasing interest rate environment, mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities may prepay at slower rates than experienced in the past, which could result in a reduction of prepayment penalty income. In addition, depositors tend to open longer term, higher costing certificate of deposit accounts which could adversely affect our net interest income if rates were to subsequently decline. Additionally, adjustable rate mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities generally contain interim and lifetime caps that limit the amount the interest rate can increase or decrease at repricing dates. Significant increases in prevailing interest rates may significantly affect demand for loans and the value of bank collateral. See \u201c- Local Economic Conditions.\u201d\nOur Lending Activities Involve Risks that May Be Exacerbated Depending on the Mix of Loan Types\nAt December 31, 2020, our gross loan portfolio was $6,701.6 million, of which 78.0% was mortgage loans secured by real estate. The majority of these real estate loans were secured by multi-family residential property ($2,534.0 million), commercial real estate ($1,754.8 million) and one-to-four family mixed-use property ($603.0 million), which combined represent 72.9% of our loan portfolio. Our loan portfolio is concentrated in the New York City metropolitan area. Multi-family residential, one-to-four family mixed-use property, commercial real estate mortgage loans, commercial business loans and construction loans, are generally viewed as exposing the lender to a greater risk of loss than fully underwritten one-to-four family residential mortgage loans and typically involve higher principal amounts per loan. Multi-family residential, one-to-four family mixed-use property and commercial real estate mortgage loans are typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related property, which is usually owned by a legal entity with the property being the entity\u2019s only asset. If the cash flow from the property is reduced, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. If the borrower defaults, our only remedy may be to foreclose on the property, for which the market value may be less than the balance due on the related mortgage loan. We attempt to mitigate this risk by generally requiring a loan-to-value ratio of no more than 75% at a time the loan is originated, except for one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, where we require a loan-to value ratio of no more than 80%. Repayment of construction loans is contingent upon the successful completion and operation of the project. The repayment of commercial business loans (the increased origination of which is part of management\u2019s strategy), is contingent on the successful operation of the related business. Changes in local economic conditions and government regulations, which are outside the control of the borrower or lender, also could affect the value of the security for the loan or the future cash flow of the affected properties. We continually review the composition of our mortgage loan portfolio to manage the risk in the portfolio.\nIn assessing our future earnings prospects, investors should consider, among other things, our level of origination of one-to-four family residential, multi-family residential, commercial real estate and one-to-four family mixed-use property mortgage loans, and commercial business and construction loans, and the greater risks associated with such loans. See \u201cBusiness - Lending Activities\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report.\nFailure to Effectively Manage Our Liquidity Could Significantly Impact Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur liquidity is critical to our ability to operate our business. Our primary sources of liquidity are deposits, both retail deposits from our branch network including our Internet Branch, brokered deposits, and borrowed funds, primarily wholesale borrowing from the FHLB-NY. Funds are also provided by the repayment and sale of securities and loans. Our ability to obtain funds are influenced by many external factors, including but not limited to, local and national economic conditions, the direction of interest rates and competition for deposits in the markets we serve. Additionally, changes in the FHLB-NY underwriting guidelines may limit or restrict our ability to borrow. A decline in available funding caused by any of the above factors could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, or fulfill our obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands.\nOur Ability to Obtain Brokered Deposits as an Additional Funding Source Could be Limited\nWe utilize brokered deposits as an additional funding source and to assist in the management of our interest rate risk. The Bank had $1.1 billion, or 17.5% of total deposits, and $388.8 million, or 7.7% of total deposits, in brokered deposit accounts at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2018, Section 29 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act was amended to no longer consider reciprocal deposits held by an FDIC-insured depository institution brokered deposits. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, reciprocal deposits totaled $735.4 million and $805.6 million, respectively. We have obtained brokered certificates of deposit when the interest rate on these deposits is below the prevailing interest rate for non-brokered certificates of deposit with similar maturities in our market, or when obtaining them allowed us to extend the maturities of our deposits at favorable rates compared to borrowing funds with similar maturities, when we are seeking to extend the maturities of our funding to assist in the management of our interest rate risk. Brokered certificates of deposit provide a large deposit for us at a lower operating cost as compared to non-brokered certificates of deposit since we only have one account to maintain versus several accounts with multiple interest and maturity checks. Unlike non-brokered certificates of deposit where the deposit amount can be withdrawn with a penalty for any reason, including increasing interest rates, a brokered certificate of deposit can only be withdrawn in the event of the death or court declared mental\nincompetence of the depositor. This allows us to better manage the maturity of our deposits and our interest rate risk. We also at times utilize brokers to obtain money market account deposits. The rate we pay on brokered money market accounts is similar to the rate we pay on non-brokered money market accounts, and the rate is agreed to in a contract between the Bank and the broker. These accounts are similar to brokered certificates of deposit accounts in that we only maintain one account for the total deposit per broker, with the broker maintaining the detailed records of each depositor. Additionally, we place a portion of our government deposits in an ICS money market or ICS demand product, which prior to 2018 was considered a brokered deposit, does not require us to provide collateral. This allows us to invest our funds in higher yielding assets. The Bank had $720.1 million in brokered demand accounts and $102.9 million brokered money market accounts at December 31, 2020. The Bank had $145.0 million in brokered demand accounts and no brokered money market accounts at December 31, 2019.\nThe FDIC has promulgated regulations implementing limitations on brokered deposits. Under the regulations, well-capitalized institutions, such as the Bank, are not subject to brokered deposit limitations, while adequately capitalized institutions are able to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits only with a waiver from the FDIC and subject to restrictions on the interest rate that can be paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions are not permitted to accept brokered deposits. Pursuant to the regulation, the Bank, as a well-capitalized institution, may accept brokered deposits. Should our capital ratios decline, this could limit our ability to replace brokered deposits when they mature.\nThe maturity of brokered certificates of deposit could result in a significant funding source maturing at one time. Should this occur, it might be difficult to replace the maturing certificates with new brokered certificates of deposit. We have used brokers to obtain these deposits which results in depositors with whom we have no other relationships since these depositors are outside of our market, and there may not be a sufficient source of new brokered certificates of deposit at the time of maturity. In addition, upon maturity, brokers could require us to offer some of the highest interest rates in the country to retain these deposits, which would negatively impact our earnings. The Bank mitigates this risk by obtaining brokered certificates of deposit with various maturities ranging up to six years, and attempts to avoid having a significant amount maturing in any one year.\nThe Markets in Which We Operate Are Highly Competitive\nWe face intense and increasing competition both in making loans and in attracting deposits. Our market area has a high density of financial institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, name recognition and market presence than us, and all of which are our competitors to varying degrees. Particularly intense competition exists for deposits and in all of the lending activities we emphasize. Our competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, finance companies and credit unions. Management anticipates that competition for mortgage loans will continue to increase in the future. Our most direct competition for deposits historically has come from savings banks, commercial banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions. In addition, we face competition for deposits from products offered by brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries, such as money market and other mutual funds and annuities. Consolidation in the banking industry and the lifting of interstate banking and branching restrictions have made it more difficult for smaller, community-oriented banks, such as us, to compete effectively with large, national, regional and super-regional banking institutions. Our Internet Branch provides us access to consumers in markets outside our geographic locations. The internet banking arena exposes us to competition with many larger financial institutions that have greater financial resources, name recognition and market presence than we do.\nOur Results of Operations May Be Adversely Affected by Changes in National and/or Local Economic Conditions\nOur operating results are affected by national and local economic and competitive conditions, including changes in market interest rates, the strength of the local economy, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. During the Great Recession, for example, unemployment increased, the housing market in the United States experienced a significant slowdown, and foreclosures rose. Adverse economic conditions can result in borrowers defaulting on their loans, or withdrawing their funds on deposit at the Bank to meet their financial obligations. A decline in the local or national economy or the New York City metropolitan area real estate market could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, including through decreased demand for loans or increased competition for good loans, increased non-performing loans and loan losses and resulting additional provisions for loan losses and for losses on real estate owned.\nMany factors could require additions to the ACL in future periods above those currently maintained. These factors include, but not limited to: (1) adverse changes in economic conditions and changes in interest rates that may affect the ability of borrowers to make payments on loans, (2) changes in the financial capacity of individual borrowers, (3) changes in the local real estate market and the value of our loan collateral, and (4) future review and evaluation of our loan portfolio, internally or by regulators. The amount of the ACL at any time represents good faith estimates that are susceptible to significant changes due to changes in appraisal values of collateral, national and local economic conditions, prevailing interest rates and other factors. See \u201cBusiness - General - Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report.\nThese same factors could cause delinquencies to increase for the mortgages which are the collateral for the mortgage-backed securities we hold in our investment portfolio. Combining increased delinquencies with liquidity problems in the market could result in a decline in the market value of our investments in privately issued mortgage-backed securities. There can be no assurance that a decline in the market value of these investments will not result in other-than-temporary impairment charges in our financial statements.\nChanges in Laws and Regulations Could Adversely Affect Our Business\nFrom time to time, legislation, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, is enacted or regulations are promulgated that have the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks and other financial institutions are frequently made in Congress, in the New York legislature and before various bank regulatory agencies. There can be no assurance as to the impact that any laws, regulations or governmental programs that may be introduced or implemented in the future will have on the financial markets and the economy, any of which could adversely affect our business. For a discussion of regulations affecting us, see \u201cBusiness -Regulation\u201d and \u201cBusiness-Federal, State and Local Taxation\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report.\nCurrent Conditions in, and Regulation of, the Banking Industry May Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Results of Operations\nFinancial institutions have been the subject of significant legislative and regulatory changes, including the adoption of The Dodd Frank Act, which imposes a wide variety of regulations affecting us, and may be the subject of further significant legislation or regulation in the future, none of which is within our control. Significant new laws or regulations or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws or regulations, including those with respect to federal and state taxation, may cause our results of operations to differ materially. In addition, the cost and burden of compliance, over time, have significantly increased and could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.\nThe Bank faces several minimum capital requirements imposed by federal regulation. Failure to adhere to these minimums could limit the dividends the Bank is allowed to pay, including the payment of dividends to the Holding Company, and could limit the annual growth of the Bank. Under the Dodd Frank Act, banks with assets greater than $10.0 billion in total assets are required to complete stress tests, which predict capital levels under certain stress levels. Although, our total assets are currently $8.0 billion, as a best practice, we completed these tests. As of December 31, 2020, under all stress scenarios, we remained well capitalized per current regulations. See \u201cRegulation.\u201d At the New York State level, the Company and the Bank are subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination by the NYDFS and the FDIC. Such regulation limits the manner in which the Company and Bank conduct business, undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing. This regulation is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and the Bank\u2019s depositors, and not to benefit the Bank or its creditors. The regulatory structure also provides the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to capital levels, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the Company and Bank to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment of significant civil money penalties against the Company and Bank.\nThe fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies determine in significant part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans\nand investments, both of which affect the Company\u2019s net interest margin. Governmental policies can also adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in Federal Reserve or governmental policies are beyond the Company\u2019s control and difficult to predict; consequently, the impact of these changes on the Company\u2019s activities and results of operations is difficult to predict.\nA Failure in or Breach of Our Operational or Security Systems or Infrastructure, or Those of Our Third Party Vendors and Other Service Providers, Including as a Result of Cyber Attacks, Could Disrupt Our Business, Result in the Disclosure or Misuse of Confidential or Proprietary Information, Damage Our Reputation, Increase Our Costs and Cause Losses\nWe depend upon our ability to process, record and monitor our client transactions on a continuous basis. As client, public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting and data processing systems, or other operating systems and facilities, may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as described below, cyber-attacks. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and clients.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions such as ours have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists and other external parties. As noted above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. Our business relies on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software and networks to conduct its operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our clients may use personal smartphones, tablet PC\u2019s, personal computers and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Although we have information security procedures and controls in place, our technologies, systems, networks and our clients\u2019 devices may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our clients\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our clients\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations. We may be subject to increasingly more risk related to security systems for our Internet Branch as we expand our suite of online direct banking products, acquire new or outsource some of our business operations, expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications, and otherwise attempt to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the financial services industry.\nThird parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.\nAlthough to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature of these threats. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a focus for us. As threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities.\nDisruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and clients, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our clients use to access our products and services could result in significant legal and financial exposure, client attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs and/or additional compliance costs, a loss of confidence\nin the security of our systems, any of which may not be covered by insurance and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, in 2017, the NYDFS established comprehensive cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies, including us. See Regulation - New York State Law and Cybersecurity.\nIn light of the newness of the cybersecurity regulation, it is impossible to determine the cost and other effects on us of full and timely compliance. In addition to resources that may be required, in the event that we do not timely and fully comply, we would be subject to enforcement and other consequences in addition to any other claims that might arise. There can be no assurance that we will achieve full and timely compliance with the regulation, in which event our business mat be materially adversely affected.\nWe May Experience Increased Delays in Foreclosure Proceedings\nForeclosure proceedings face increasing delays. While we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any delay in foreclosure sales, we may be subject to additional borrower and non-borrower litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to our past and current foreclosure activities. Delays in foreclosure sales, including any delays beyond those currently anticipated could increase the costs associated with our mortgage operations and make it more difficult for us to prevent losses in our loan portfolio.\nOur Inability to Hire or Retain Key Personnel Could Adversely Affect Our Business\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain and attract key personnel. We face intense competition from commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, finance companies and credit unions. As a result, it could prove difficult to retain and attract key personnel. The inability to hire or retain key personnel may result in the loss of customer relationships and may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe Are Not Required to Pay Dividends on Our Common Stock\nHolders of shares of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. A reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nUncertainty surrounding the elimination of LIBOR and the proposed transition to SOFR may adversely affect our business\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). Subsequent announcements have delayed the potential date for certain LIBOR tenors until June 30, 2023. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR. Similarly, there is still uncertainty around how quickly different alternative rates will develop sufficient liquidity and industry-wide usage, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments. We have loans, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR could create additional costs and risks. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, systems, contracts, valuation tools, and product design. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation and potentially introduce additional legal risks. As of December 31, 2020, we have exposure to approximately $2.5 billion of financial assets and liabilities, including off-balance sheet instruments, which are LIBOR-based. We do not yet know whether, and if so the extent to which, the elimination of LIBOR will have any material impact on these instruments.\nThe Ultimate Success of Integrating Empire into the Company\u2019s operations cannot be assured and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be fully realized\nAlthough the merger has been completed, the ultimate success of the merger will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to finalize the integration of the businesses of the Company and Empire in a manner that permits growth opportunities and cost savings to be realized. As with any merger of financial institutions, there can be no assurances that the merger and the integration processes will ultimately be successful nor that the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger will be fully realized. In the longer term, as the Company continues to integrate Empire\u2019s legacy business into the Company\u2019s business, the actual cost savings of the merger could be less than anticipated.", "PERMNO": 82573, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FFIC"}
