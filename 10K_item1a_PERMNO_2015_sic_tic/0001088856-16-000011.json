RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves significant risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and related notes, before you decide to invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us; however, they may not be the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Korlym\nWe depend heavily on the success of Korlym. If we are unable to increase revenue of Korlym to the levels that investors expect, or experience significant delays in doing so, our stock price will likely decline.\nWe anticipate that for the foreseeable future our ability to generate meaningful revenue and fund our commercial operations and development programs will be solely dependent on the successful commercialization of Korlym. Many factors could hamper our efforts to commercialize Korlym, including:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nan inability to generate sufficient revenue due to low product usage or inadequate insurance coverage and reimbursement;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ncompetition from Novartis\u2019s Signifor and from other companies with greater financial and marketing resources than ours;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nan inability to manufacture Korlym or the active ingredient in Korlym in commercial quantities and at an acceptable cost;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\npolitical concerns relating to other uses of mifepristone that could limit the market acceptance of Korlym;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\npreviously unknown, serious side effects that may be identified; and\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nrapid technological change making Korlym obsolete.\nFailure to meet revenue expectations of investors could cause our stock price to decline.\nPhysicians may accept Korlym slowly or may never accept it, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nPhysicians will prescribe Korlym only if they determine, based on experience, clinical data, side effect profiles and other factors, that it is preferable to other treatments, even if those products are not approved for Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Because Cushing\u2019s syndrome is rare, most physicians are inexperienced in the care of patients with the illness and it may be difficult to persuade them to prescribe a newer treatment, such as Korlym, even with clinical trial results that suggest it may be a compelling treatment.\nOther factors that may affect the commercial success of Korlym include:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nthe rate of adoption of Korlym by physicians and patients;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nthe possible preference of some physicians for more familiar, long-standing off-label treatments for Cushing\u2019s syndrome or for Novartis\u2019 drug, Signifor, for the treatment of Cushing\u2019s disease;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nthe cost-effectiveness of Korlym and the availability of third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ncompetition from alternative treatment methods, such as surgery and radiation therapy;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nthe product labeling required by the FDA for Korlym; and\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nnegative publicity concerning Korlym, RU-486, Mifeprex\u00ae or mifepristone.\nThe failure of Korlym to achieve commercial success would prevent us from generating sufficient revenue to fully fund our commercial and development activities.\nThe Orphan Drug designation for Korlym may not prevent competition from companies that develop mifepristone or other compounds for the treatment of Cushing\u2019s syndrome. These companies may have significantly more resources than we do. Competition from them could limit our revenue from the commercialization of Korlym for the treatment of Cushing\u2019s syndrome or other indications.\nAlthough we have received Orphan Drug designation in the United States, we cannot be assured that we will realize the potential benefits of the designation. Even after an orphan drug is approved for its orphan indication, the FDA can subsequently approve a different drug for the same condition if it concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Upon\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nexpiration of the orphan drug exclusivity period, we may be subject to competition from manufacturers offering a generic form of Korlym at a lower price, in which case our business could be harmed.\nNotwithstanding Korlym\u2019s Orphan Drug designation in the United States, in 2012 Novartis received approval in both the United States and the European Union (EU) to market its somatostatin analogue Signifor for adult patients with Cushing\u2019s disease (a subset of Cushing\u2019s syndrome that afflicts approximately 70 percent of all Cushing\u2019s syndrome patients) for whom pituitary surgery is not an option or has not been curative. Novartis also announced that it is undertaking an investigational study of an experimental compound to determine whether it can safely reduce the level of urinary free cortisol in patients with Cushing\u2019s disease and to examine the compound\u2019s safety. Novartis has substantially more resources and experience than we do and may provide significant competition.\nWe are aware that Laboratoire HRA Pharma (HRA) received Orphan Drug designation in the United States and the EU for the use of mifepristone to treat a subtype of Cushing\u2019s syndrome. HRA had begun a Phase 2 clinical trial in Europe and the United States for this indication, which has been terminated. We are aware that Strongbridge Biopharma plc (Strongbridge) has received Orphan Drug designation in the United States and the EU for the use of levoketoconazole to treat Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Strongbridge has begun a Phase 3 clinical trial in Europe and the United States for this indication. We are also aware that Exelgyn Laboratories, which operates as a subsidiary of Medi Challenge (Pty) Ltd., received Orphan Drug designation for mifepristone to treat Cushing\u2019s syndrome in the EU, but it has stated that it has not yet conducted any clinical trials.\nIf we cannot continue to obtain acceptable prices or adequate coverage and reimbursement for Korlym from third-party payors, we will be unable to generate significant revenues.\nThe commercial success of Korlym depends on whether third-party coverage and reimbursement is available. Government payors, including Medicare, Medicaid and the Veterans Administration, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new medicines, and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for Korlym. Our dependence on the commercial success of Korlym makes us particularly susceptible to cost containment efforts. Accordingly, even though Korlym has been approved for commercial sale, unless government and other third-party payors continue to provide adequate and timely coverage and reimbursement, physicians may not prescribe it and patients may not purchase it. In addition, meaningful delays in insurance coverage for individual patients may increase our costs and reduce our revenues.\nIn some foreign markets, pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to government control. In the United States, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals for similar controls. Also, the trends toward managed health care in the United States and recent laws and legislation intended to reduce the cost of government insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products and may result in lower prices for Korlym or the exclusion from reimbursement programs.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which was passed in 2010, included the following measures:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nannual, non-deductible fees on any entity that manufactures or imports certain prescription drugs and biologics;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nincreases in Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for both branded and generic drugs;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer\u2019s Medicaid rebate liability;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nexpansion of access to commercial health insurance coverage through new state-based health insurance marketplaces, or exchanges;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical research;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nnew requirements for manufacturers to discount drug prices to eligible patients by 50 percent at the pharmacy level and for mail order services in order for their outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nan increase in the number of entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program.\nThe PPACA provisions on comparative clinical effectiveness research extended the initiatives of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also known as the stimulus package, which included $1.1 billion in funding to study the comparative effectiveness of health care treatments. This stimulus funding was designated for, among other things, conducting, supporting or synthesizing research that compares and evaluates the risks and benefits, clinical outcomes, effectiveness and appropriateness of products. The PPACA also appropriated additional funding to comparative clinical effectiveness research. Although Congress has indicated that this funding is intended to improve the quality of health care, it remains unclear how the research will impact current\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMedicare coverage and reimbursement or how new information will influence other third-party payor policies. It also is unclear what the full impact of PPACA\u2019s extension of coverage to previously uninsured individuals will be on the demand for our product.\nOther legislative and regulatory changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of two percent per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. On February 1, 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, published a final rule that revised certain requirements involved in our calculation of prices we report in connection with our participation in government reimbursement programs so that Korlym will be eligible for purchase by, or qualify for partial or full reimbursement from, Medicaid and other government programs. The extent to which this rule may alter our reported prices and estimated rebates and chargebacks under government programs remains unclear.\nThese new laws and the regulations and policies implementing them, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our products.\nPublic perception of mifepristone may limit our ability to sell Korlym.\nThe active ingredient in Korlym, mifepristone, is approved by the FDA in another drug for the termination of early pregnancy. As a result, mifepristone has been and continues to be the subject of considerable ethical and political debate in the United States and elsewhere. Public perception of mifepristone may limit our ability to engage alternative manufacturers and may limit the commercial acceptance of Korlym by patients and physicians. Even though we have taken measures to minimize the likelihood of the prescribing of Korlym to a pregnant woman, physicians may choose not to prescribe Korlym to a woman simply to avoid any risk of unintentionally terminating a pregnancy.\nWe have no manufacturing capabilities and we currently depend on two third-parties, both of which are single-source suppliers, to manufacture the active ingredient and the tablets for Korlym. If these suppliers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing Korlym and we are unable to contract quickly with alternative sources, or if these third-party manufacturers fail to comply with FDA regulations or otherwise fail to meet our requirements, our business will be harmed.\nWe have no manufacturing capabilities and depend solely on single-source third-parties to manufacture Korlym. We depend on PCAS, a third-party manufacturer, to supply all of the API in Korlym. We depend on AAI, another third-party manufacturer, to produce all of our Korlym tablets. We have entered into long-term agreements with these manufacturers. However, if either of them is unable or unwilling to meet our future requirements, we may not be able to manufacture our product in a timely manner. Our current arrangements with these manufacturers are terminable by such manufacturers, subject to certain notice provisions.\nThe facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our product must be approved by the FDA. We do not control the manufacturing processes of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with the regulatory requirements known as current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs). If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our products or if it withdraws any such approval, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly hamper our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our products. In addition, sanctions could be imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could harm our business. If our suppliers fail to manufacture tablets on a timely basis in the quantities that we require, or fail to maintain manufacturing capabilities that meet FDA standards, we may exhaust our Korlym inventory and will not be able to generate revenue.\nIf we or others identify previously unknown, serious side effects of Korlym or mifepristone, we may be required to perform lengthy additional clinical trials, change the labeling of Korlym or withdraw it from the market.\nThe FDA\u2019s approval of Korlym required that we conduct a study of the interactions between Korlym and ketoconazole, an anti-fungal agent sometimes used to treat patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome. The data from this study are currently being analyzed. It also\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrequires us to study drug utilization to better characterize the reporting rates of adverse events associated with the long-term use of Korlym. If we or others identify previously unknown, serious side effects of Korlym or mifepristone:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nwe may be required to conduct additional clinical trials, make changes in labeling, implement changes to or obtain re-approvals of our manufacturing facilities;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nwe may experience a significant drop in the sales of Korlym;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nour reputation in the marketplace may suffer; and\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nwe may become the target of lawsuits, including class action lawsuits.\nAny of these events could harm or prevent sales of Korlym or could increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing Korlym.\nWe may not have adequate insurance to cover our exposure to product liability claims.\nWe may be subject to product liability or other claims based on allegations that the use of Korlym has resulted in adverse effects or that our product candidates are not effective, whether by participants in our clinical trials for Korlym or other product candidates, or by patients using Korlym. A product liability claim may damage our reputation by raising questions about Korlym or any of our product candidates\u2019 safety or efficacy and could limit our ability to sell a product by preventing or interfering with product commercialization. In some cases, less common adverse effects of a pharmaceutical product are not known until long after the FDA approves the product for marketing. The active ingredient in Korlym is used to terminate pregnancy. Therefore, clinicians using the medicine in our clinical trials and physicians prescribing the medicine to women with childbearing potential must take strict precautions to ensure that the medicine is not administered to pregnant women. The failure to observe these precautions could result in significant product liability claims.\nWe have only limited product liability insurance coverage, with limits that we believe to be customary for a company marketing a single pharmaceutical product. We intend to expand our product liability insurance coverage to any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. However, this insurance may be prohibitively expensive or may not fully cover our potential liabilities. Our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of Korlym or our product candidates, or result in meaningful underinsured or uninsured liability. Defending a lawsuit could be costly and significantly divert management\u2019s attention from conducting our business. If we were successfully sued for injury caused by our product candidates, our liability could exceed our total assets.\nWe are subject to ongoing and continued regulatory review. If we are unable to maintain regulatory approval of Korlym, or if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we will be unable to generate revenue or may be subject to penalties and our business will be harmed.\nEven after we obtain U.S. regulatory approval for a product, the FDA may impose significant restrictions on the uses for which the product may be marketed or on the conditions of approval, such as potentially costly post-approval studies and surveillance, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to monitor the product\u2019s safety and efficacy. The FDA\u2019s approval of Korlym was subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed and requirements for post-marketing follow-up studies and information reporting, as noted above. If we violate any of the restrictions or fail to meet the conditions of approval, the FDA could withdraw its approval.\nWe are subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries with respect to the research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, selling, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and marketing of products. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, annual updates on manufacturing activities and continued compliance with cGMPs, and current good clinical practices (cGCPs), for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. cGMPs and cGCPs are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities through periodic inspections of manufacturing sites, trial sponsors, clinical investigators and clinical sites. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with FDA regulations and other applicable foreign and U.S. regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, untitled letters, warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, holds on clinical trials, product seizure or detention, refusal to permit the import or export of products, restrictions on product marketing, withdrawal of the product from the market, voluntary or mandatory product recalls, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to approve pending New Drug Applications (NDAs) or supplements to approved NDAs, and suspension or revocation of product approvals.\nThe FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional governmental regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may place at risk the FDA marketing approval for Korlym and any other marketing approval that we may obtain, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may be subject to civil or criminal penalties if we market Korlym in a manner that violates FDA regulations or health care fraud and abuse laws.\nIn the United States, we are subject to FDA regulations governing the promotion of health care products. Although physicians are permitted, based on their medical judgment, to prescribe drugs for indications other than those approved by the FDA, manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products for such \u201coff-label\u201d uses. In the United States, we market Korlym for treatment of hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing\u2019s syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery and provide promotional materials and training programs to physicians regarding the use of Korlym for this indication. Although we believe our marketing materials and training programs for physicians do not constitute \u201coff-label\u201d promotion of Korlym, the FDA may disagree. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials, training or other activities by our employees or agents constitute \u201coff-label\u201d promotion of Korlym, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or other activities or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal or state enforcement authorities might take action if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. Even if it is later determined that we are not in violation of these laws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant expenses defending our position and have to divert significant management resources from other matters.\nIn addition, there are health care fraud and abuse regulations and enforcement by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nfederal false claims laws, which prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of promotional and marketing activities, such as allegedly providing free product to or entering into \u201csham\u201d consulting arrangements with customers to induce such customers to purchase, order or recommend the company\u2019s products in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute and federal false claims laws and regulations; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by certain governmental programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in the promotion of \u201coff-label\u201d uses that caused customers to submit claims to and obtain reimbursement from governmental payors for non-covered \u201coff-label\u201d uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nfederal \u201csunshine\u201d laws that require transparency regarding financial arrangements with health care providers, such as the reporting and disclosure requirements imposed by the PPACA on drug manufacturers regarding any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to prescribers and other health care providers, and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to submit reports detailing these financial arrangements by the 90th day of each calendar year;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and their respective implementing regulations, which impose obligations on covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nThe risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Moreover, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the PPACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes; a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them. In addition, the PPACA provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from governmental health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nA break-down or breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of third-parties with which we contract are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. System failures, accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations, and could result in a material disruption of our clinical and commercialization activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. The loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and our product research, development and commercialization efforts could be delayed.\nThe occurrence of a catastrophic disaster or other similar events could cause damage to our own or our manufacturers\u2019 facilities and equipment, which could require us to cease or curtail operations.\nOur business is vulnerable to damage from various types of disasters or other similarly disruptive events, including earthquake, fire, flood, power loss and communications failures. For example, our headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is earthquake-prone, and our specialty pharmacy and warehouses are located in areas that are subject to severe weather conditions. In addition, political considerations relating to mifepristone may put us and our manufacturers at increased risk for terrorist attacks, protests or other disruptive events. If any disaster or other similar event were to occur, we may not be able to operate our business and our manufacturers may not be able to produce Korlym or our product candidates. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover, and our insurance policies may exclude coverage for, our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions.\nRisks Related to the Development of our Product Candidates\nClinical drug development is lengthy and expensive and has an uncertain outcome. Results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical development is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and data obtained from clinical trials and supportive studies are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The results from early clinical trials may not be predictive of results eventually obtained in later clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profile of their medication candidate, despite promising results in earlier trials. Clinical trials may not demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain regulatory approval.\nOur ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of mifepristone in combination with chemotherapy to treat TNBC is too small to demonstrate definitively the safety or efficacy of mifepristone for that indication. Even if the trial generates positive results, those results would have to be confirmed in at least one substantially larger, more expensive, and lengthier trial if we are to have sufficient basis for seeking regulatory approval.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMoreover, the commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ndelays obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nobtaining institutional review board (IRB), approval at each site;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nslower than anticipated patient enrollment;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nscheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nlack of funding;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nnegative or inconclusive results;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\npatient noncompliance with the protocol;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nadverse medical events or side effects among patients during the clinical trials;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nnegative or problematic FDA inspections of our clinical operations or manufacturing operations; and\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nreal or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of mifepristone.\nWe could encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, the IRBs of the clinical trial sites where such trials are being conducted, the Data Safety Monitoring Board for such trial, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may impose a suspension or termination due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nOver the course of clinical development of any product candidate, we may decide, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require us, to pursue clinical or preclinical studies in addition to those we had initially anticipated. Additional trials or studies may require additional funding, the availability of which is not assured. Also, it is possible that additional trials or studies that we decide are necessary or desirable will delay or prevent the completion of our development programs. Even if we are able to conduct all of the clinical trials and supportive studies that we consider appropriate, we may never receive regulatory approval to market other product candidates, including mifepristone for the treatment of TNBC or any other indication.\nWe depend on third-parties to conduct and manage many of our clinical trials and to perform related data collection and analysis and, if these third-parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected timelines, we may face costs and delays that may prevent or delay us from obtaining regulatory approval for or commercializing our product candidates, which could substantially harm our business.\nWe rely on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients and other third-parties such as CROs to manage many of our trials and to perform related data collection and analysis. We control only certain aspects of these third-parties\u2019 activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the prescribed protocol, and the applicable legal, regulatory and scientific standards. Our reliance on third-parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and these third-parties are required to comply with cGCPs. If we or any of the third-parties working on or conducting our trials fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approval of our marketing applications, if at all. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with cGCP requirements. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, we may not be able to control the timing of identification and selection of appropriate sites for our planned trials and the amount and timing of resources that the clinical sites that conduct the clinical testing may devote to our clinical trials. If our clinical investigators and clinical sites fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials or fail to enroll them on our planned schedules, we will be unable to complete our trials or to complete them as planned, which could delay or prevent us from completing the clinical development of mifepristone for the treatment of TNBC or other development programs.\nWe have agreements with the CRO and consultants conducting and managing our Phase 1/2 trial of mifepristone for the treatment of TNBC and Phase 1 trial of CORT125134, to supervise and monitor clinical site performance and to perform investigator supervision, data collection and analysis for these trials. The conduct of future clinical trials, including our planned Phase 2 studies of CORT125134, may also be conducted through the use of CROs and third-party clinical sites. We may not be able to maintain relationships with these or other CROs or with the clinical investigators and the clinical sites through the completion of all trial activities without delays in anticipated timing of trial activities or excessive expenditures. If any of our relationships with CROs or other third-parties terminates,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nwe may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or third-parties on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If these CROs, clinical investigators, clinical sites or other third-parties do not carry out their contractual duties or obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines, or if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, mifepristone for the treatment of TNBC, or CORT125134 or any of our other next-generation selective cortisol modulators.\nWe may be unable to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for our product candidates, including mifepristone for the treatment of TNBC.\nWe are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities and, while we have received FDA marketing approval for Korlym, we may be unable to maintain such approval and we may never receive such regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. Obtaining regulatory approval of a new drug is an uncertain, lengthy and expensive process, and success is never guaranteed. Failure can occur at any stage. In order to receive approval from the FDA for a product candidate, we must demonstrate that the new drug product is safe and effective for its intended use and that our manufacturing processes for the product candidate comply with the FDA\u2019s cGMPs. These cGMPs include requirements related to production processes, quality control and assurance, and recordkeeping. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process for human medicines. The FDA may require substantial additional clinical testing or find our drug products do not satisfy the standards for approval. Our inability or the inability of our suppliers to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, delays in or denials of new product approvals, warning letters, fines, consent decrees restricting or suspending manufacturing operations, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of sales, and/or criminal prosecution. Any of these or other regulatory actions could materially harm our business and our financial condition.\nFuture governmental action or changes in FDA policy or personnel may also result in delays or rejection of an NDA in the United States. In addition, because the only other currently FDA-approved use of mifepristone is the termination of pregnancy, we expect that the label for mifepristone for any indication will include, as Korlym\u2019s does, some limitations, including a so-called \u201cblack-box\u201d warning that it should not be used by pregnant women or women seeking to become pregnant.\nIf we receive regulatory approval for our future product candidates, including mifepristone for the treatment of TNBC, we will be subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory oversight and review, such as continued safety reporting requirements; and we may also be subject to additional FDA post-marketing restrictions and obligations. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our product candidates and/or may be subject to product recalls or seizures. Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our future product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the medicine may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing follow-up studies. In addition, if the FDA approves any of our product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing and continuing regulatory requirements.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates abroad.\nWe may seek to commercialize our products and product candidates in international markets with the help of one or more partners or on our own. Outside the United States, we may commercialize a product only if we receive a marketing authorization and, in many cases, pricing approval, from the appropriate regulatory authorities, whose approval processes include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process, and, in some cases, additional risks. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Although we have received Orphan Drug designation in the EU, we are not currently seeking to obtain any foreign approvals.\nApproval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our product candidates in any foreign market.\nWe face competition from companies with substantial financial, technical and marketing resources.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our present and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical companies, as well as specialized pharmaceutical firms, universities and public and private research institutions. Moreover, we expect competition to intensify as technical advances are made. These competitors, either alone or with collaborative parties, may succeed with the development and commercialization of medicinal products that are superior to and more cost-effective than mifepristone.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMany of our competitors and related private and public research and academic institutions have greater experience, more financial and marketing resources and larger research and development staffs than we do. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have significantly greater experience than we do in developing human medicines, obtaining regulatory approvals, manufacturing and commercializing products.\nOur product candidates may not be effective competitors compared to established treatments and our present or potential competitors may succeed in developing medicinal products that are superior to our product candidates, which could render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. If we are unable to establish our product candidates as a superior and cost-effective treatment, we may be unable to commercialize them.\nOur efforts to discover, develop and commercialize product candidates beyond Korlym for the treatment of patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome - including our development of mifepristone to treat patients with TNBC - are at an early stage and may fail to successfully commercialize any of them.\nTo develop additional sources of revenue, we believe that we must identify and develop new product candidates or new therapeutic uses for mifepristone. The use of cortisol modulators may not be effective to treat any additional indications. Moreover, we could discover that the use of cortisol modulators has unacceptable side effects or is otherwise not safe. Due to the potential for lack of efficacy and side effects inherent in novel compounds and in new uses for existing medications, we are entering multiple compounds into development, which will increase our rate of spending with no assurance that we will be successful in developing new drugs that are safe and effective.\nWe may not develop or continue to develop product candidates for any of the indications or compounds covered by our patents and patent applications. Typically, there is a high rate of attrition for product candidates in pre-clinical and clinical trials, and our product development efforts may not lead to commercially viable products. For example, although we plan to advance new compounds to the clinic, we may fail to do so.\nWe may elect to enter into collaboration arrangements with respect to one or more of our product candidates. If we do enter into such an arrangement, we would be dependent on a collaborative partner for the success of the product candidates developed under the arrangement. Any future collaborative partner may fail to successfully develop or commercialize a product candidate under a collaborative arrangement.\nWe only have significant clinical experience with mifepristone and we may determine that mifepristone is not desirable for uses other than for the treatment of Cushing\u2019s syndrome. For example, we do not intend to develop mifepristone for mitigation of the weight gain associated with the use of Zyprexa, Risperdal or other atypical antipsychotics, even though we have reported positive results in double blind placebo controlled studies. We may pursue other cortisol modulators for this use. The compounds developed pursuant to our early clinical, preclinical and discovery research programs may fail to become viable product candidates regardless of the resources we dedicate to their development. Even if product candidates are identified, we may abandon further development efforts before we reach clinical trials or after expending significant expense and time conducting clinical trials due to financial constraints, concerns over the safety or efficacy of the product candidates, marketing considerations, manufacturing difficulties or other reasons. Moreover, governmental authorities may enact new legislation or regulations that could limit or restrict our development efforts. If we are unable to successfully discover and commercialize new uses for cortisol modulators, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to support our operations.\nWe will need to increase the size of our organization and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nWe expect that the further development of our research and development efforts will be constrained by our existing administrative, operational and management resources. Growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate additional employees. To date, we have relied on a small management team, including a number of part-time contributors. Our future financial performance and our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage growth effectively.\nTo that end, we must be able to:\np\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nhire additional management, clinical development, administrative and sales and marketing personnel;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nexpand the size and composition of our management team;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ndevelop our administrative, accounting and management information systems and controls;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nhire and train additional qualified personnel;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nmanage our sales and marketing efforts effectively;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nmanage our supply chain effectively;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nmanage our clinical trials effectively; and\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nmanage our research and development efforts effectively.\nWe may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could harm our business.\nIf we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional skilled personnel, we may be unable to pursue our product development and commercialization efforts.\nOur ability to operate successfully and manage our potential future growth depends significantly upon retaining key managerial, scientific, sales, marketing, and financial personnel, and attracting and retaining additional highly qualified personnel in these areas. We depend substantially on the principal members of our management and scientific staff. We do not have agreements with any of our executive officers that provide for their continued employment with us or employment insurance covering any of our key personnel. Any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time and work for one of our competitors. The loss of these key individuals could result in competitive harm because we could experience delays in our product research, development and commercialization efforts without their expertise.\nWe face intense competition for qualified personnel from numerous companies, as well as universities and nonprofit research organizations in the highly competitive San Francisco Bay Area. Although we believe that we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to date, we may not be able to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel in the future. The inability to attract and retain these personnel could result in delays in the research, development and commercialization of our potential products.\nRapid technological change could make our product and product candidates obsolete.\nPharmaceutical technologies have undergone rapid and significant change and we expect that they will continue to do so. Our future will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies. Korlym and any products and processes that we develop may become obsolete or uneconomical before we recover any or all expenses incurred in connection with their development. Rapid technological change could make Korlym and our product candidates obsolete or uneconomical, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Needs and Financial Results\nWe may need additional capital in order to complete the development and commercialization of Korlym for additional indications or for the development and commercialization of our proprietary, selective cortisol modulators. Additional capital may not be available to us at all or on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may need to raise additional funds to continue and expand the development and commercialization of Korlym and our proprietary, selective cortisol modulators in additional indications. We may also raise additional funds for other research and development activities, including clinical trials, and working capital and for other general corporate purposes, or to acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies that are complementary to our own.\nFactors affecting our liquidity include the following:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nthe pace at which physicians adopt Korlym as a treatment;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nthe willingness of insurance companies and the government payors to provide coverage for Korlym;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nthe timing and outcome of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of Korlym for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer and further clinical development related to this indication;\n\uf0b7\uf020\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nthe outcome of our planned Phase 2 clinical trials of CORT125134 and further clinical development of that compound;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nchanges in our research and development plans for our other proprietary, selective cortisol modulators;\n\uf0b7\uf020\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nthe need to perform additional clinical trials and other supportive studies;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights, including announcements of claims of infringement, interference or litigation against us or our licensors.\nWe may also choose to raise additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current and future operating plans.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Our sales of common stock and warrants and the exercises of warrants have been dilutive to stockholders and any exercise of outstanding warrants and additional equity financing could cause further dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. If we obtain funds through\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncollaborations with others, these arrangements may be on unfavorable terms or may require us to relinquish certain rights to Korlym, our technologies or product candidates, which we would otherwise seek to develop on our own. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or we may be required to discontinue operations.\nWe have incurred substantial losses and we may incur losses in the future.\nWe have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through private placements of preferred and common stock, the public sale of common stock, revenue from the sale of Korlym and our financing agreement with Biopharma. On an annual basis, we have incurred losses in each year since our inception in 1998. We may incur additional losses as we continue our discovery and clinical development programs, apply for regulatory approvals, acquire and/or develop treatments in other therapeutic areas, and expand our sales and marketing capabilities.\nWe may not be able to pursue all of our product research and development opportunities if we are unable to generate sufficient revenue or secure adequate funding for these programs.\nThe costs required to start or continue many of the programs that our intellectual property allows us to consider for further development are collectively greater than the funds currently available to us. For example, we have successfully discovered three series of compounds that are selective cortisol modulators but do not appear to block the progesterone receptor. Further development of these proprietary compounds or any further development stemming from our method of use patents may be delayed or cancelled if we determine that such development may jeopardize our ability to complete the clinical development of Korlym for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.\nGlobal economic conditions could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nIn the United States and globally, market and economic conditions have been volatile over the past few years. Renewed or increased turbulence in the global markets and economies may cause lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease, to provide credit to businesses such as ours, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nIf we do not have sufficient cash flow to continue operating our business and are unable to borrow funds or raise equity or debt capital, we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity. Such alternatives may include, without limitation, curtailing clinical or drug development activity, or limiting our commercial efforts, product manufacturing or sales and marketing support, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIf we acquire other selective cortisol modulators or other technologies or potential products, we will incur a variety of costs and may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nIf appropriate opportunities arise, we may attempt to acquire other technologies or product candidates that are complementary to our operating plan. We currently have no commitments, agreements or plans for any acquisitions. Acquiring rights to another potential product or technology may result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business. In addition, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquired potential product or technology. Future acquisitions could dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership interest in us and could cause us to incur debt, expose us to future liabilities and result in amortization or other expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets.\nFailure to meet our obligations under our Financing Agreement with Biopharma could adversely affect our financial results and liquidity.\nPursuant to our Financing Agreement with Biopharma entered into in August 2012, we are obligated to make payments to Biopharma equal to 20 percent of our net product sales of Korlym, any future mifepristone-based products and our next-generation selective cortisol modulators, subject to certain quarterly caps, as well as an un-capped 20 percent of any upfront, milestone or other contingent payments we receive with respect to Covered Products, until such payments to Biopharma total $45.0 million, at which point the obligation will extinguished.\nPursuant to this agreement, we may not: (i) incur indebtedness greater than the sum of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including such items as non-cash stock-based compensation, for the four calendar quarters preceding such incurrence, which we refer to as the Indebtedness Covenant; (ii) pay a dividend or other cash distribution, unless we have cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50.0 million after such payment; (iii) amend or restate our certificate of incorporation or bylaws unless such amendments or restatements do not affect Biopharma\u2019s interests under the transaction; and (iv) encumber any of the collateral securing our performance under the agreement.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe percentage used to calculate our payments to Biopharma would increase to 50 percent and any applicable payment caps would lapse if we (i) fail to provide Biopharma with certain information regarding our promotion and sales of Covered Products, (ii) do not devote a commercially reasonable amount of resources to the promotion and marketing of the Covered Products or (iii) violate the Indebtedness Covenant and, in each case, fail to cure within the applicable cure period.\nUpon a Corcept change of control transaction, as defined in the agreement, Biopharma will be automatically entitled to receive any amounts not previously paid, up to our maximum repayment obligation of $45.0 million. As defined in the agreement, \u201cChange of Control\u201d includes, among other things, (i) a greater than 50 percent change in the ownership of Corcept, (ii) certain changes in Board composition of Corcept and (iii) the licensing of Korlym to a third-party for sale in the United States.\nTo secure our obligations under the agreement, we granted Biopharma a security interest in our rights in patents, trademarks, trade names, domain names, copyrights, know-how and regulatory approvals related to the Covered Products, all books and records relating to the foregoing and all proceeds of the foregoing, which we refer to as the Collateral. If we (i) fail to deliver a royalty payment when due and do not remedy that failure within 30 days, (ii) fail to maintain a first-priority perfected security interest in the Collateral in the United States and do not remedy that failure within five business days of receiving notice of such failure or (iii) become subject to an event of bankruptcy, then Biopharma may attempt to recover up to $45.0 million (after deducting any payments we have already made).\nWe cannot assure that we will not breach the covenants or other terms of, or that an event of default will not occur under this agreement and, if a breach or event of default occurs, we cannot assure that we will be able to cure the event within the time permitted. Any failure to pay our obligations when due, any breach or default of our covenants or other obligations, or any other event that causes an acceleration of payment at a time when we do not have sufficient resources to meet these obligations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future viability.\nThe acceleration of the payment obligation in the event of a change of control transaction may make us less attractive to potential acquirers, and the payment of such funds out of our available cash or acquisition proceeds would reduce acquisition proceeds for our stockholders.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nIf Korlym or future product candidates conflict with the patents of others or if we become involved in other intellectual property disputes, we may have to engage in costly litigation or obtain a license and we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates.\nThe patent positions of companies in the pharmaceutical industry are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have been and continue to be the subject of much litigation. Our product candidates may give rise to claims that our patents are invalid or that we infringe on the products or proprietary rights of others. If it is determined that our product candidates infringe on others\u2019 patent rights, we may be required to obtain licenses to those rights. If we fail to obtain licenses when necessary, we may experience delays in commercializing our product candidates while attempting to design around other patents, or determine that we are unable to commercialize our product candidates at all. If we do become involved in intellectual property litigation, we are likely to incur considerable costs in defending or prosecuting the litigation. We believe that we do not currently infringe any third-party\u2019s patents or other proprietary rights, and we are not obligated to pay royalties relating to the use of intellectual property to any third-party other than Stanford University and the University of Chicago.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain adequate patent protection for the use of Korlym for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer and other potential uses of cortisol modulators. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our intellectual property and erode our competitive advantage.\nWe own 19 issued U.S. method of use patents and have exclusively licensed five issued U.S. method of use patents with one licensed application pending. We have five U.S. method of use patent applications pending for our next-generation selective cortisol modulators. We also own eight composition of matter patents. We have applied, and will continue to apply, for patents covering our product candidates as we deem appropriate. We have filed, where we deemed appropriate, foreign patent applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and applications.\nWe have exclusively licensed three issued U.S. patents from Stanford University for the use of cortisol modulators, including mifepristone, in the treatment of psychotic depression, cocaine-induced psychosis and early dementia, including early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We have also exclusively licensed from the University of Chicago two issued U.S. patents for the use of cortisol modulators in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer, and a second patent family with applications in the United States and Europe having claims directed to the use of cortisol modulators to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer.\nWe bear the costs of prosecuting, protecting and defending the rights to these patents. In order to maintain the exclusive license to these patents until their expiration, we are obligated to make milestone and royalty payments to both universities. If we become\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nnoncompliant with our obligations under our agreements, we may lose the right to commercialize mifepristone for the treatment of psychotic depression, cocaine-induced psychosis, early dementia, triple-negative breast cancer and castration-resistant prostate cancer and our business would be materially harmed. In addition, if Stanford University were to terminate our mifepristone license due to breach of the license on our part, we would not be able to commercialize mifepristone for the treatment of psychotic depression, cocaine-induced psychosis or early dementia. If the University of Chicago were to terminate our licenses, we may not be able to commercialize cortisol modulators for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer or castration-resistant prostate cancer.\nOur patent applications and patents licensed or issued to us may be challenged by third-parties and our patent applications may not result in issued patents. For example, in 2004, Akzo Nobel (now a division of Merck & Co.) filed an observation challenging the claims of our exclusively licensed European patent application with claims directed to psychotic depression. In this instance, the patent later issued and, in 2007, we received notice from the European Patent Office that there will be no opposition proceedings in Europe in regard to this patent.\nOur presently pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents, and any patent issued to us may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable or circumvented. For example, the arguments presented by Akzo Nobel could be raised in the United States either before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or in a court of law. Furthermore, the claims in patents which we own or have licensed, or which we may license or which may be issued to us in the future, may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third-parties from producing competing products. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries in which we compete may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. If we fail to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary technology, our competitors may produce competing products based on our technology, which would impair our ability to compete.\nIf a third-party successfully asserted an infringement claim against us, we could be forced to pay damages and be prevented from developing, manufacturing or marketing our potential products. We do not have liability insurance for patent infringements. A third-party could require us to obtain a license to continue to use their intellectual property, and we may not be able to do so on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. We believe that significant litigation will continue in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. If we become involved in litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of our resources. Regardless of the merit of any particular claim, defending a lawsuit takes significant time, is expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention from other business.\nOur ability to compete in the market could be diminished if we are unable to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on a combination of confidentiality, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, laws protecting trade secrets and security measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. Nevertheless, these measures may not adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information. If they do not adequately protect our rights, third-parties could use our proprietary information, which could diminish our ability to compete in the market. In addition, employees, consultants and others who participate in the development of our product candidates may breach their agreements with us regarding our trade secrets and other proprietary information, and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach. We also realize that our trade secrets may become known through means not currently foreseen. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative products that are equal or superior to our product candidates without infringing on any of our proprietary information or trade secrets.\nThe mifepristone patents that we own cover the use of mifepristone, not its composition, which may make it more difficult for us to prove patent infringement if physicians prescribe another manufacturer\u2019s mifepristone or if patients acquire mifepristone from other sources, such as the internet or underground market.\nWe own or have exclusively licensed issued U.S. patents covering the methods of using cortisol modulators to treat a variety of disorders, including triple-negative breast cancer. A method of use patent covers only a specified use of a particular compound, not a compound\u2019s composition. Because our patents do not cover the composition of mifepristone, we cannot prevent others from commercializing mifepristone in indications such as triple-negative breast cancer or those set forth in our other method of use patents. Although any such \u201coff-label\u201d use would violate our patents, effectively monitoring compliance with our patents may be difficult and costly. In addition, we cannot be assured that patients will not obtain mifepristone from other sources. As with other pharmaceutical products, patients may be able to purchase mifepristone through the internet or underground market. Mifepristone is also sold in the United States by Danco Laboratories for the termination of early pregnancy. While distribution is limited to a single dose provided in the physician\u2019s office and covered by other restrictions, we cannot be certain that Cushing\u2019s syndrome patients will not be able to obtain mifepristone from this source or others, should another company receive approval to market mifepristone for another indication.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile due to the limited number of shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates or factors influencing the stock market and opportunities for sale at any given time may be limited.\nWe cannot assure that an active trading market for our common stock will exist at any time. Holders of our common stock may not be able to sell shares quickly or at the market price if trading in our common stock is not active. During the 52-week period ended March 7, 2016, our average daily trading volume was approximately 339,969 shares and the intra-day sales prices per share of our common stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market ranged from $3.22 to $7.67. As of March 7, 2016, our officers, directors and principal stockholders controlled 26 percent of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nthe pace of market acceptance of Korlym or the timing and level of insurance coverage and reimbursement;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nactual or anticipated timing and results of our clinical trials;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or failure of our financial performance to meet the guidance we have provided to the public;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\npurchases or sales of our common stock by us, our officers, directors or our stockholders;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ndistributions in-kind of our common stock by our venture capital or private equity stockholders, which will increase the supply of our common stock and could decrease its price;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nour cash and short-term investment position;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nnew products or services introduced or announced by us or our competitors;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nactual or anticipated regulatory approvals of our product candidates or of competing products;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nchanges in the expected or actual timing of our development programs or our competitors\u2019 potential development programs;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results, including potential product returns and timing of revenue recognition;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nannouncements of technological innovations by us, our collaborators or our competitors;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ngeneral market and economic conditions;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nconditions or trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ndevelopments concerning collaborations;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nlimited number of shares of our common stock held by our non-affiliates;\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nmaintaining compliance with the listing requirements of the stock exchange on which we are listed; and\n\uf0b7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nsuccess of additional financing efforts.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, The NASDAQ Stock Market and the market for biotechnology and life sciences companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur stock price may decline if our financial performance does not meet the guidance that we provided to the public, estimates published by research analysts or other investor expectations.\nWe have provided guidance as to our expected 2016 net product revenue. Our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of the release of such guidance. Our actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material.\nThere are a number of reasons why we might fail to meet our financial guidance or other expectations about our business, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. In particular, there are inherent difficulties in predicting the amount of Korlym that will be sold. For example, the rate of physician adoption of Korlym is uncertain. Research analysts who cover our business have put forth a range of revenue estimates, based on their own analyses. We believe research analysts will consider the guidance we have provided as one factor in determining their own annual revenue estimates. Estimating our net revenue for future periods is difficult and you should rely on our guidance and the estimates of research analysts at your own discretion. If, in the future, our operating or financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance, analyst estimates or the expectations of investors, or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, our stock price may decline.\nResearch analysts may not continue to provide or initiate coverage of our common stock or may issue negative reports.\nSecurities analysts currently covering our common stock may discontinue research coverage. Additional securities analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock. A lack of research coverage may adversely affect our common stock\u2019s market price. The trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who elects to cover us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline rapidly and significantly. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. In addition, rules mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and a global settlement reached in 2003 between the SEC, other regulatory analysts and a number of investment banks have led to a number of fundamental changes in how analysts are reviewed and compensated. In particular, many investment banking firms are required to contract with independent financial analysts for their stock research. It may be difficult for companies such as ours with smaller market capitalizations to attract independent financial analysts that will cover our common stock. This could have a negative effect on our market price.\nSale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock. As additional shares of our common stock become available for resale in the public market, whether as a result of equity financings by us, distributions in-kind of our common stock by our venture capital or private equity stockholders, or due to the release of trading restrictions, the supply of our common stock will increase, which could decrease the price. Substantially all of the shares of our common stock are eligible for sale, subject to applicable volume and other resale restrictions.\nOur officers, directors and principal stockholders, acting as a group, could significantly influence corporate actions.\nAs of March 7, 2016, our officers and directors control 26 percent of our common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders and may prevent or delay a change in control. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages to owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders.\nChanges in laws and regulations may significantly increase our costs, which could harm our financial results.\nNew laws and regulations, as well as changes to existing laws and regulations, affecting our company, including the provisions of the PPACA requiring the reporting of aggregate spending related to health care professionals, the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules adopted by the SEC and by The NASDAQ Stock Market have and will likely continue to result in increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements. We are investing resources to comply with evolving laws and regulations, and this investment may result in increased selling, general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nIn addition, new rules and regulations could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, or our board committees, or as executive officers. At present, we cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs related to new rules and regulations or the timing of such costs.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may fail to comply with public company obligations, including the securities laws and regulations. Such compliance is costly and requires significant management resources.\nWe are a small company with limited resources. The federal securities laws and regulations, including the corporate governance and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, impose complex and continually changing regulatory requirements on our operations and reporting. These requirements have increased and will continue to increase our legal compliance costs.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on the internal control over financial reporting. This same legislation also requires that the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. If we are unable to complete the required assessment as to the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting in future years or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of future year ends, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting.\nChanges in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges or require us to change our accounting policies or operating practices.\nAccounting methods and policies for business and marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies are subject to continual review, interpretation and guidance from relevant accounting authorities, including the SEC. Although we believe that our accounting practices are consistent with current accounting pronouncements, changes to or interpretations of accounting methods or policies in the future may require us to reclassify, restate or otherwise change or revise our financial statements. Any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and income. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and under Delaware law and payment acceleration provisions under the Biopharma Financing Agreement may make an acquisition of us or a change in our management more expensive or difficult, even if an acquisition or a management change would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions in our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. Some of these provisions allow us to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders, require advance notification of stockholder proposals and nominations of candidates for election as directors and prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent. In addition, a supermajority vote of stockholders is required to amend our bylaws. Our bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by our Chairman, President or the Board of Directors and that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the Board of Directors. These provisions may prevent or delay a change in our Board of Directors or our management, which is appointed by our Board of Directors. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Section 203 may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us. In addition, our payment obligations to Biopharma accelerate in the event of a change of control transaction. See \u201cRisk Factors - Failure to meet our obligations under our Financing Agreement with Biopharma could adversely affect our financial results and liquidity.\u201d These provisions in our charter and bylaws and under Delaware law and the Financing Agreement could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions.", "PERMNO": 90125, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "CORT"}
