{"cik": "1059562", "company": "LMI AEROSPACE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Report when evaluating our business and financial condition. These risks may not be exhaustive and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to the Company and Industry\nThe announcement of our agreement to be acquired by Sonaca could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and our stock price.\nOn February 16, 2017, we entered into the Merger Agreement with the Sonaca entities defined therein (the \"Sonaca Entities\"). Our announcement of having entered into the Merger Agreement could cause a material disruption to our business. Additionally, we are subject to additional risks in connection with the announcement and operations prior to Closing, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nmarket reaction to the announcement of the Transaction;\n\u2022\ndisruption to our business, including the continued diversion of significant management and other resources towards the completion of the Transaction;\n\u2022\nchanges in the respective business, operations, financial position and prospects of either company during the Transaction process;\n\u2022\nmarket assessments of the likelihood that the Transaction will be consummated;\n\u2022\nthe impact of any legal proceedings that have been or may be instituted against us, our directors, executive officers and others relating to the Transaction; and\n\u2022\nour incurrence and continued incurrence of significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other costs in connection with the Transaction, many of which are payable by us regardless of whether the Transaction is consummated.\nIn addition, the Merger Agreement includes restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the Closing, generally requiring us to conduct our businesses in the ordinary course, consistent with past practice, and subjecting us to a variety of specified limitations absent prior written consent by the Sonaca Entities. We may find that these and other contractual arrangements in the Merger Agreement may delay, prevent us from or limit our ability to respond effectively to financing needs, competitive pressures, industry developments and future business opportunities that may arise during such period, even if our management and board of directors think they may be advisable.\nMoreover, our customers, financial counterparties and other persons with whom we have a business relationship may have uncertainties about the effects of the Transaction. Accordingly, it is possible that some customers, financial counterparties and other persons with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationship with us as a result of the Transaction. Similarly, current and prospective employees\nmay experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following completion of the Transaction, which may adversely affect our ability to attract, recruit, and retain employees.\nAny of the effects noted above could materially and adversely impact our revenues, earnings and cash flows and other business results and financial condition, as well as the market price of our common stock and our perceived acquisition value, regardless of whether the Transaction is completed.\nThe delay or failure of the Transaction to be completed may adversely affect our business and our stock price.\nConsummation of the Transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including:\n\u2022\nthe approval of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company;\n\u2022\nthe expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended;\n\u2022\nclearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations;\n\u2022\nthe absence of any order, injunction or law preventing or prohibiting the consummation of the Transaction;\n\u2022\nthe accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (subject to certain materiality qualifiers);\n\u2022\ncompliance with covenants and agreements in the Merger Agreement in all material respects; and\n\u2022\nthe absence of a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThere can be no assurance that these conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied, or that the Merger will be completed on the proposed terms, within the expected timeframe or at all. In addition, other factors, such as the Sonaca Entities\u2019 ability to obtain the financing it needs to consummate the Merger, although such financing is not a condition to Closing, may affect when and whether the Merger will occur.\nIf the Transaction is significantly delayed or is not completed, our stock price could fall to the extent that our current stock price reflects an assumption that the Transaction will be completed. Furthermore, if the Transaction is significantly delayed or not completed, we may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and stock price, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe could be required to pay a termination fee of up to $15 million to the Sonaca Entities under certain circumstances as described in the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022\nwe would have incurred significant costs in connection with the Transaction that we would be unable to recover;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to negative publicity or be negatively perceived by the investment or business communities;\n\u2022\nwe would not realize any or all of the potential benefits of the Transaction and our shareholders would not realize the 52% premium to the closing price of our common stock on February 16, 2017, which was a factor among many in our board\u2019s decisions to approve the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to legal proceedings related to any delay or failure to complete the Transaction;\n\u2022\nany disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Transaction, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers, suppliers, other business partners and employees, may continue or intensify in the event the Transaction is not consummated; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to take advantage of alternative business opportunities or effectively respond to competitive pressures.\nThe Merger Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternative transactions, and in certain instances requires payment of a termination fee, which could deter a third party from proposing an alternative transaction.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that, subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability to initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage, or engage in discussions or negotiations with respect to, or provide non-public information in connection with, a proposal from a third party with respect to an alternative transaction. In addition, under specified circumstances in which the Merger Agreement is terminated, we could be required to pay a termination fee of up to $15 million. It is possible that these or other provisions in the Merger Agreement might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of our company from considering or proposing an acquisition or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire our common stock than it might otherwise have proposed to pay.\nLitigation challenging the Merger Agreement may prevent the Transaction from being consummated at all or within the expected timeframe and may result in substantial costs to us.\nA class-action lawsuit has been filed against us, our Board of Directors and other parties to the Merger Agreement, challenging our acquisition by the Sonaca Entities. This lawsuit brought by a purported stockholder of LMI Aerospace, Inc. seeks, among other things, to enjoin consummation of the Merger. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that no governmental entity having jurisdiction over us, the Sonaca Entities, or any of the other parties to the Merger Agreement shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other material action enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger substantially on the terms contemplated by the Merger Agreement. As such, if the plaintiff is successful in his effort, then our acquisition by the Sonaca Entities may not be consummated at all or within the expected timeframe.\nFuture growth based largely in part on anticipated significantly higher production rates depends on our ability to expand production at our manufacturing facilities and effectively execute growing work statements.\nCertain large commercial and corporate aircraft manufacturers have announced planned production rate increases for several of their major programs. In some cases, in order to meet these increases in production rates, we are making significant capital expenditures to expand our capacity and improve performance and integrating new people, equipment and processes into our business. If difficulty is experienced with effectively managing these efforts to meet the planned increases in production rates or should we fail to execute effectively, it could cause disruptions in our manufacturing lines or the manufacturing lines of our customers and suppliers, which could have a material adverse impact on our ability to meet commitments to our customers and on our future financial results.\nWe may experience continued decline in demand for design engineering services.\nDue to the current lack of development programs as well as an increase in insourcing of design engineering services by our OEM customers, our Engineering Services business segment has experienced a significant decline in demand in recent years. In 2016, we recorded a pre-tax charge for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $28.4 million related to the Engineering Services segment, which followed a $26.4 million non-cash, non-deductible goodwill impairment charge related to Engineering Services in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. Both charges were directly related to the overall decline in demand for engineering. If we are unable to find new sources of revenue for Engineering Services and leverage the capabilities of the segment to a greater extent, we may continue to be impacted by further declines.\nWe may experience additional costs to import our products manufactured outside the United States as a result of potential changes in trade partnerships, treaties or tax law changes impacting imported goods.\nRecent changes in the United States federal government have caused significant uncertainty about the future of trade partnership and treaties, such as the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The current administration has expressed its desire to or has already taken action against these types of agreements, which have the ability to impact the industry on a macro level in terms of affecting demand for American built aircraft on which the Company has significant content as well as affect the Company more directly in its ability to leverage its lower cost facility in Mexico. Additionally, the tax law changes being considered for proposal could unfavorably impact our tax rate due to the potential for interest to no longer be deductible and certain other deductions being lost due to foreign production of goods.\nWe may be required to invest additional capital or offer substantial discounts to continue existing partnerships or develop new strategic partnerships with customers.\nMany of our customers are moving toward developing strategic, and sometimes risk-sharing, partnerships with their larger suppliers. Each strategic partner provides an array of integrated products and services, including purchasing, warehousing\nand assembly. We have been designated as a strategic partner by some customers and are striving to become a strategic partner of other customers. In order to maintain our current strategic partnerships and establish new ones, we will likely need to either spend additional capital to secure future partnerships, although we may not have the financial ability to do so or offer substantial price discounts to certain customers, which may negatively affect our profitability on certain contracts or programs.\nOEMs in the aerospace industry have significant pricing leverage over suppliers such as us, and may be able to achieve price reductions over time, which could adversely impact our profitability.\nThere is substantial and continuing pressure from OEMs in the aerospace industry on suppliers such as us to reduce prices for products and services. Such pricing pressure has continued due to excess capacity in the industry and the availability of competitive pricing from businesses in low-cost labor areas. If we are required to provide further price reductions to our customers and are unable to offset these effects through operating cost reductions and efficiencies, our gross margins, profitability and cash flows could be reduced.\nWe face intense competition and significant pricing pressures in the markets we serve.\nOur competitors in the aerospace industry consist of a large fragmented group of companies, including certain business units or affiliates of our customers. We believe that competition within the aerospace industry will continue to increase substantially as a result of industry consolidation, trends favoring greater outsourcing of components and a decrease in the number of preferred suppliers. We also believe foreign aerospace manufacturers and engineering service providers and foreign divisions of domestic aerospace businesses will become an increasing source of competition, due largely to these businesses' access to low-cost labor and the increased prevalence of industry participation commitments, pursuant to which domestic OEMs agree to award production work to manufacturers from a foreign country in order to obtain orders from that country. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, production and other resources than we have. These competitors may have:\n\u2022\nthe ability to adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements and industry conditions or trends;\n\u2022\ngreater access to capital;\n\u2022\nstronger relationships with customers and suppliers;\n\u2022\ngreater name recognition; and\n\u2022\npurchased (or in the future, may purchase) critical suppliers and make them captive causing delays and potential price increases.\nIn addition, our major customers may choose not to outsource production of certain products that we currently sell to them due to, among other things, their own labor, equipment, and other capacity utilization considerations. As a result, traditional factors affecting competition, such as price and quality of service, may not weigh significantly when OEMs decide whether to produce a part or service in-house or to outsource.\nDue to the size and duration of certain of our long-term contracts, we are required by GAAP to estimate sales and expenses for these contracts in our financial statements, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those estimated under our assumptions or conditions.\nOur financial statements are prepared in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). To be compliant with GAAP, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding our contracts that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Contract accounting requires our use of judgment relating to assessing risks, estimating contract sales and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues, among other matters. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and cost is very complicated and subject to many variables, including development program delays and the expected recovery of deferred cost. Therefore, actual results may differ materially from those estimated.\nSales to a limited number of customers represent a significant portion of our revenue, and our long-term agreements with these customers are generally terminable upon written notice.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, $212.1 million of our aggregate sales were dependent upon relationships with the following three major customers and certain programs related to each: Spirit AeroSystems, Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, and The Boeing Company. Although a majority of our sales, including sales to these customers, are made pursuant to long-term agreements, these agreements are generally terminable upon advance written notice by the customer and typically do not require\nthe customer to purchase any specific quantity of products. As a result, our sales under these agreements may not continue for the full term of the agreements or sales may not be consistent with historical levels. Additionally, the loss of any one of these customers, a significant reduction in the amount of orders received from any one of these customers, particularly on the Boeing 737 platform, or the failure to receive new program awards from any one of these customers, could cause a significant decrease in our sales and profitability. While we are always seeking out new customer opportunities, we anticipate that a small number of large customers will continue to represent a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable future.\nRecent failures by OEMs to successfully outsource non-core capabilities and services on new platforms may cause our customers to reevaluate outsourcing strategies resulting in fewer machined and fabricated components and assemblies being outsourced.\nThe Company's failure to meet quality or delivery expectations of customers could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur customers have increased their expectations with respect to the on-time delivery and quality of our products and we anticipate those expectations to continue into the future. Further, announced delivery rate increases over the next few years coupled with our plans to reduce inventory levels could put additional strain on the Company's quality and delivery performance. If we fail to meet the quality or delivery expectations of our customers, this failure could result in any of the following: significant penalties, liquidated damages, recalls, costs to repair products not meeting our customer requirements, contract termination, management distraction and adverse effects to our production schedules and contract profitability. The loss of one or more of our significant customers could be damaging considering $212.1 million of our aggregate sales for the most recently-ended fiscal year were from three major customers.\nAccess to funding through the capital markets and debt financing are essential to the execution of our business plan and, if we are unable to continue to obtain such access, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nOur ability to invest in our businesses, fund our operations and contractual commitments and make strategic acquisitions requires access to the capital markets, access to term debt and/or sufficient bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings. If we are unable to continue to access the capital markets and debt financing on terms acceptable to us as a result of, for example, disruption or declines in the capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings could cause us to experience difficulties in successfully executing our long-term growth strategy and/or a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIn addition, our customers may also experience difficulty accessing the credit markets from time to time. As a result, our customers' ability to purchase our products or services may decrease. If our customers' operating and financial performance deteriorates, or if they are unable to make scheduled debt payments or obtain credit, our customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable owed to us. Any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, and relationships with lenders and suppliers.\nOur future success will depend, to an extent, on our ability to stay current with technological changes, such as the development of alternative aerospace materials, changes in manufacturing techniques and new engineering software to meet the needs of our customers.\nWe believe that the commercial, military and other markets in which we operate are changing toward more sophisticated materials (e.g. composite technologies), manufacturing techniques and capabilities (e.g. additive manufacturing), some of which could require significant capital investment to employ. We believe our future success depends, to an extent, on our ability to acquire and/or develop expertise in non-metal materials and remain current on new manufacturing technologies and equipment to meet the needs of our customers. The significant cost of new equipment required to exploit certain developing manufacturing techniques and capabilities could be prohibitive. If we are unable to acquire new equipment and/or develop and execute such techniques and capabilities or we are unable to efficiently apply them, we could experience an adverse effect to our business, financial condition or results of operations. Although we are in the process of continuing to expand our development of non-metallic production capabilities and are engaged in development activities exploring the possibilities of alternative manufacturing techniques, we currently do not have significant capacity to produce large quantities of non-metal components or expertise in newer manufacturing methods.\nOur products and processes require advanced equipment that is not easily programmed, repaired or replaced; equipment failures that we could experience may cause us to be unable to meet quality or delivery expectations of our customers.\nMany of our manufacturing processes are dependent on advanced equipment and software. Because sophisticated equipment is often not easily programmed, repaired or replaced, unexpected failures of this equipment could result in production delays or the manufacturing of defective products. We also currently lack redundancy with certain sophisticated equipment which could impact our ability to meet the expectations of our customers with respect to on-time delivery of quality products. Our failure to meet the quality or delivery expectations of our customers could lead to the loss of one or more of our significant customers. However, the significant investment in our equipment and facilities that we have made and expect to make in the future may not exceed our related cost of capital.\nWe may experience cost over-runs related to orders for new products and changes to existing products, and should we be unsuccessful in negotiating claims, we may be unable to recoup the resulting increased costs.\nWe generally sell our products under multi-year agreements on a firm fixed-price basis, regardless of variable production costs. As a result, factors such as engineering changes, inaccurate estimating and pricing , manufacturing inefficiencies, start-up costs and increases in the cost of labor, materials or overhead may result in cost over-runs and losses on those agreements. While in the past we have been successful in negotiating these issues with our customers, we cannot guarantee in the future that we will succeed in obtaining customer agreement to re-price a particular product, and we may not be able to recoup previous losses resulting from such issues as incomplete or inaccurate engineering data or out-of-tolerance tooling.\nEngineering Services has historically provided the majority of its services under time and material arrangements. However, recent changes in the industry and the design-build programs have resulted in an increasing number of fixed-price arrangements. Fixed-price development work inherently has more uncertainty for us than work pursuant to production or time and material contracts and, therefore, more variability in the estimates of the cost to complete such work. Development programs have very complex designs, and as technical or quality issues arise, we may experience schedule delays and higher costs to complete. Management uses its reasonable judgment to estimate the cost to perform the work and the price that we should charge. While we believe the cost and price estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates. If we underestimate the cost of a project and are unable to adjust the price accordingly, our profit margin will be less than expected, or we could incur a loss on the project.\nOur long-term growth strategy depends on our ability to maintain a robust and effective supply-chain management system.\nAs we pursue our long-term growth strategy, we will be providing to our customers increasingly sophisticated components, assemblies and value-added services under increasing pricing pressure. The increased complexity of our products, the expected increased production rates from our key customers, expected and negotiated customer discounts, and outsourcing of non-core activities and the value-added services we are providing to our customers require us to maintain and manage an efficient, high performing and cost-effective supply chain to assure timely delivery of quality components needed to meet our delivery schedules. Effective management of our supply chain may become more difficult if our customers' production increases. Failure to continue to develop this capability or to procure from our suppliers\u2019 quality components on a timely basis and acceptable pricing could make us non-competitive during the bidding process, decrease customer satisfaction, result in significant costs related to product recalls or charges for rework and thus our competitiveness, and could also result in lost revenue and lower profitability due to contractual penalties or lost sales.\nOur long-term success and growth strategy depend on our ability to attract, integrate and retain additional qualified personnel.\nBecause of the highly specialized and complex nature of our business, our success and future growth also depends on management's ability to attract, hire, train, integrate and retain skilled personnel in all areas of our business. Competition for such personnel is intense, and in some Company locations, labor supply and skill base is limited. Our inability to adequately staff our operations with skilled personnel could render us less efficient and decrease our rate of production. We have written employment agreements with all members of our executive management team, however, the loss of service of one or more of our executive management personnel could result in a loss of skills and/or knowledge, which may hinder our ability to successfully pursue our long-term growth strategy.\nWe are subject to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry, and any future downturn in the aerospace industry or general economic conditions could cause our sales and operating income to decrease.\nWe derive virtually all of our revenue from the sale of services and components for the aerospace industry. Consequently, we are directly affected by certain characteristics of and trends in the aerospace industry or general economic conditions that affect our customers, such as:\n\u2022\nthe relative state of the aerospace industry\u2019s business cycle;\n\u2022\nnew programs in commercial, military, and general aviation, which have historically experienced significant delays and engineering changes that adversely impact our sales, results of operations and cash flow;\n\u2022\nfluctuating fuel and labor costs;\n\u2022\nintense price competition and regulatory scrutiny;\n\u2022\ncertain trends, including a decrease in outsourcing by aircraft manufacturers or the failure of projected market growth to materialize or continue;\n\u2022\nchanges in military budgeting, sequestration and procurement for certain military aircraft; and\n\u2022\nmilitary trend toward utilizing more Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, reducing the demand for more traditional military aircraft (e.g. Boeing, General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin).\nWhile the aerospace industry as a whole has been experiencing an upcycle for some time, in the event that these characteristics and trends adversely affect customers in the aerospace industry, the overall demand for our products and services could be significantly reduced, thereby decreasing our sales and operating income.\nWe may be required to record material impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets, which would reduce our net income and earnings per share.\nCurrent accounting standards require a periodic review of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment in value if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount will not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets, management is required to make certain critical estimates and assumptions, particularly as to manufacturing efficiency, the achievement of reductions in operating costs, and increased sales and backlog. If any of these or other estimates and assumptions are not realized in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets, which charges would reduce net income and earnings per share.\nIn the second quarter of 2016, a triggering event occurred when the Company significantly downgraded the full-year 2016 sales and operating income forecast for its Engineering Services business due to continued decline in demand. This downward adjustment to the forecast, combined with lower than expected operating results for the second quarter of 2016, was deemed to be a triggering event requiring an interim impairment evaluation for the Engineering Services reporting unit in accordance with ASC 350. An impairment analysis was performed and determined that the carrying value of related goodwill and intangible assets exceeded its fair value. As a result, a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $28.4 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2016. This charge reduced the net book value of this reporting unit's intangible assets and goodwill to $0.3 million and $0.0 million, respectively.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2013, the Company recorded pre-tax, non-cash, goodwill impairment charges of $26.4 and $73.5 million, respectively, within the Engineering Services segment and Aerostructures segment, respectively.\nGoodwill accounts for $62.5 million, or 16.3%, of the Company\u2019s total assets at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, the fair value of our reporting units exceeded or approximated their net book value.\nSee Critical Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" for additional disclosure related to these items.\nRisks associated with foreign operations could adversely impact us.\nWe operate facilities in Mexico, the United Kingdom and Sri Lanka. Doing business in foreign countries is subject to various risks, including political instability, local economic conditions, foreign government regulatory requirements, trade tariffs and the potentially limited availability of skilled labor in proximity to our facilities. In addition, we have been operating our Mexican facility through a shelter arrangement under a contractual agreement with a Mexican company. If we are unable to renew this agreement in future years on terms satisfactory to us, we may incur increased labor costs and/or experience a disruption in its operations in Mexico. We also benefit from favorable tax treatment from Mexico. Should there be changes to the laws in Mexico taxing assets not previously subject to taxation, our profitability on products manufactured at our Mexico facility could be negatively impacted.\nIf we are unable to protect our information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems to manage and support a variety of business activities, including procurement and supply chain, engineering support and manufacturing. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components of our technology. These systems may also be subject to failures due to: power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, or even catastrophic events. In addition, security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our manufacturing process could be disrupted, resulting in late deliveries and breached customer contracts. In addition, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, and financial condition.\nCompliance with and changes in environmental, health and safety laws and other laws that regulate the operation of our business and industry standards could increase the cost of production and expose us to regulatory claims.\nOur operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local laws and substantial regulation by government agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d), the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d), the Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\"), and the U.S. Department of Defense (\"DoD\"). Among other matters, these agencies impose requirements that:\n\u2022\nregulate the operation, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials generated or used by us during the normal course of our operations;\n\u2022\ngovern the health and safety of our employees; and\n\u2022\nrequire that we meet standards and licensing requirements for aerospace components.\nIn particular, we use and generate hazardous waste in our operations. Consequently, we monitor hazardous waste management and applicable environmental permitting and reporting for compliance with applicable laws at our locations in the ordinary course of our business. We may be subject to potential material liabilities relating to any investigation and cleanup of any contamination at our locations or properties where we deliver hazardous waste for handling or disposal and to claims alleging personal injury. In addition, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The adoption of new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs and become subject to new or increased liabilities that could increase our operating costs and adversely affect the manner in which we conduct our business.\nWe are also subject to U.S. Export Regulations, including the Arms Export Control Act, associated International Traffic in Arms Regulations and Export Administration Regulations. Failure to comply with such regulations could result in substantial fines, significant time and costs related to training personnel for cause and corrective action, penalties and limit our ability to export certain products.\nWhile we are required to hold FAA certifications only to a limited extent, we typically are required to maintain third-party registrations with respect to industry specification standards, such as AS9100 and NADCAP, for our quality systems and processes. In fact, many individual OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers require certifications or approvals of our work based on third-party registrations in order to engineer and serve the systems and components used in specific aircraft models. If material OEM certifications or approvals were to be revoked or suspended, OEMs might cease purchasing our products.\nMoreover, if in the future new or more stringent governmental regulations are adopted, or industry oversight heightened, such action could result in our incurrence of significant additional costs and have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nA downgrade, suspension or withdrawal, if any, of the rating assigned by a rating agency to the Company or our notes could adversely affect the price of our common stock and other costs of capital.\nOur notes have been rated by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies and may be rated by additional rating agencies in the future. We also have corporate ratings assigned by rating agencies. We cannot guarantee that any rating assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency's judgment, circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our business, so warrant. Any downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of a rating by a rating agency could adversely affect the price of our common stock and other costs of capital.\nDecreases in the availability or increases in the cost of our raw materials would increase our operating costs.\nMost of our components are manufactured from aluminum products. From time to time, we, and the aerospace components industry as a whole, have experienced shortages in the availability of aerospace quality aluminum. In addition, we utilize certain materials in the manufacture of our non-aerospace products that, in some cases, may be provided by a limited number of suppliers. Raw material shortages could limit our ability to meet our production needs and adversely affect our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis. Also, raw material shortages and capacity constraints at our raw material producers are outside of our control and can cause the price of aluminum to increase. Any significant shortage or price escalation of raw materials such as aluminum could increase our operating costs, which would likely have an adverse impact on our financial results. Composite and machined products have a higher percentage of raw material content and thus, are more susceptible to gross margin impacts. As rate increase on commercial aerospace platforms rise so do the lead times for certain raw material which makes reorder points a critical step in our manufacturing and planning process. One part missed in the process could result in a delivery being delayed and our ability to meet commitments to our customers and our future financial results being jeopardized.\nOur facilities are located in regions that are affected by natural disasters.\nSeveral of our facilities are located in regions that have a higher than average risk of earthquake and tornado activity and one of our facilities has experienced damage due to floods. Although we maintain earthquake and flood loss insurance where we deem appropriate, an earthquake, flood or other natural disaster could disrupt our business, result in significant recovery costs and cause our productivity and profits to decrease.\nDemand for our defense-related products depends in part upon government spending.\nA material portion of our sales, 13.2% in the year ended December 31, 2016, is derived from the military market. The military market is largely dependent upon government budgets, particularly the U.S. defense budget. The funding of government programs is subject to Congressional appropriation and the possibility of sequestration. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, the U.S. Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be expected to continue for several years. Consequently, programs, including those that require our components, including the Blackhawk,, and, may be only partially funded or may never enter full-scale production as expected. As a result, future U.S. defense spending may not be allocated to programs that would benefit our business or at the levels we had anticipated. A decrease in levels of defense spending or the government's termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for the programs in which we participate would adversely impact our sales, cash flow, and growth prospects.\nMost U.S. government contracts under which we are subcontracted can be terminated by the U.S. government either for its convenience or if the prime contractor defaults by failing to perform under the contract. In addition, the prime contractor typically has the right to terminate our subcontract for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the subcontract. Termination for convenience provisions generally permit us to recover only our costs incurred or committed, plus settlement expenses and a reasonable profit, which may be different from what we bid or our historical profit rates, on the work completed prior to termination. Debarment from participating in government contracts could lead to loss of sales and disruption in our workflow.\nWe may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing backlog.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $391.0 million of order backlog. As a service provider, our Engineering Services segment does not typically utilize backlog to monitor its operations. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. From time to time, our OEM customers provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in the future under new and existing programs. These projections are not included in our backlog unless we have received a firm purchase order or commitment from our customers. Our customers may have the right, under certain circumstances and with certain penalties or consequences, to cancel, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If our customers cancel, reduce or defer firm orders, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected.\nGiven the nature of our industry and customers, there is always a risk that orders may be cancelled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers' production and/or sales forecasts, purchasing budgets or inventory management practices. Moreover, our realization of sales from new and existing programs is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including the possibility that our customers will not launch programs on time, or at all, and the number of units that our customers will actually produce may change or the timing of production may be altered. Also, until firm orders are committed, our customers generally have the right to discontinue a program, dual source or replace us with another supplier at any time without penalty. Our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs would adversely impact our revenue; results of operations and cash flow, as a large portion of our operating expenses are relatively fixed.\nOperation by end-users of the product platforms into which our components are integrated could expose us to product liability claims.\nWe may be exposed to possible claims of personal injury, death, grounding costs, property damage or other liabilities that result from the failure or malfunction of a component or assembly fabricated or designed by us. We currently have policies in place for products liability and premises insurance, which we believe provide adequate coverage in amounts and on terms that are generally consistent with industry practice. Nevertheless, to the extent a claim is made against us that is not covered in whole or in part by our current insurance, we may be subject to a material loss. Moreover, any claims that are covered by our policies would likely cause our premiums to increase, and we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage levels in the future. Additionally, since we do not carry product recall insurance we could be subject to recall expenses associated with any product failures determined to be our fault.\nWe may raise capital, which could result in dilution and cause the stock price of our common stock to decline.\nOur business plan anticipates the need for new capital to support the continued development of capabilities, either through internal investment or acquisition. We may raise new capital through debt (including debt securities and/or bank borrowings), the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or the issuance of securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock. Should we choose to raise capital by issuing or selling shares of our common stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock) for any reason, such issuance will likely have a dilutive effect on the holders of our common stock and/or could have a material negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nOur substantial level of indebtedness may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $243.3 million of total debt outstanding including notes of $224.2 million, due July 15, 2019. We had no outstanding borrowings under our current revolving credit facility at December 31, 2016.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness relative to shareholders\u2019 equity could have important consequences to you, including with respect to our ability to declare and pay a dividend, and significant effects on our business, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on the notes and our other indebtedness, which reduces the funds available to use for operations and other purposes including our other financial obligations;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired;\n\u2022\nwe could be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt;\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited;\n\u2022\nour ability to fund a change of control offer may be limited; and\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.\nOur ability to meet our expenses and make debt payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, and our currently anticipated growth in sales and cash flow may not be realized, either or both of which could result in our being unable to repay indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we do not\nhave enough funds, we may be in breach our debt covenants and/or be required to refinance all or part of our then existing debt, sell assets or borrow more funds, which we may not be able to accomplish on terms favorable to us, or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives.\nThe indenture governing the notes imposes significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and taking certain actions that may be potentially profitable or in our best interests.\nThe indenture governing the notes imposes, and future debt agreements may impose, operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nissue stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ngrant or permit certain liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\npay dividends, redeem subordinated debt or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate or transfer substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\ntransfer, sell or acquire assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nchange the business we conduct.\nThese covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, engage in business activities, including future opportunities that may be in our interest, and plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders or holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and proceed foreclosing on any collateral securing that indebtedness. Acceleration of our other indebtedness could result in a default under the terms of the Indenture. There is no guarantee that we would be able to satisfy our obligations if any of our indebtedness is accelerated.\nDue to many factors beyond our control, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the notes, and meet our other ongoing liquidity needs, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt agreements, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations, including the notes, and to fund any future capital expenditures and meet our other ongoing liquidity needs depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions, fluctuations to such conditions, and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future and our currently anticipated levels of revenue and cash flow may not be realized, either or both of which could result in our being unable to repay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the notes.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including our indebtedness under our new revolving credit facility and the notes. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time and may require our lenders\u2019 consent, which we may not be able to obtain. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous borrowing covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, any failure to make payments of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nOur current revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictive covenants that limit our flexibility. We may not be able to comply with these covenants, which could result in the amounts outstanding under our current revolving credit facility becoming immediately due and payable.\nOur current revolving credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants based on outstanding amounts. Accordingly, if our financial performance significantly worsens, we could become non-compliant with such covenants. If we fail to meet any covenants in our current revolving credit facility and cannot secure a waiver of such failure, the lenders under current revolving credit facility would be entitled to exercise various rights, including causing any amounts outstanding to become immediately due and payable.\nIn addition, our current revolving credit facility contains other restrictive covenants, including covenants that limit and in some circumstances prohibit, our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, sell, lease or transfer our assets, pay dividends, make investments, loans, advances and acquisition, engage in sale-leaseback transactions, guarantee debt or obligations, create liens, enter into transactions with our affiliates and enter into certain merger, consolidation or other reorganization transactions. We would also be subject to requirements to make mandatory prepayments with the net proceeds of certain asset sales and debt issuances, and so long as any such debt issuance is permitted pursuant to the credit facility, there would be no corresponding reduction of the commitment amount. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand the current or future downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise, any of which could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have less debt and are not subject to such restrictions.", "PERMNO": 86178, "SIC": 3728, "TIC": "LMIA"}
