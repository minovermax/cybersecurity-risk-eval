{"cik": "1747009", "company": "Equitrans Midstream Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects. The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important for understanding any statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and the financial statements and accompanying notes included in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" Note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to pay dividends could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our results of operations, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Related to EQM's Business\nEQM depends on EQT for a substantial majority of its revenues and future growth. Therefore, EQM is subject to the business and liquidity risks of EQT, and any further decrease in EQT's drilling or completion activity could adversely affect EQM's business and operating results.\nHistorically, EQM has provided to EQT a substantial percentage of its natural gas gathering, transmission and storage and water services. EQT accounted for approximately 69% of EQM's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. We expect EQM to derive a substantial majority of its revenues from EQT for the foreseeable future.\nAdditionally, on February 26, 2020, EQM entered into the EQT Global GGA with EQT for the provision by EQM of gas gathering services to EQT in the Marcellus and Utica Shales of Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The execution of the EQT Global GGA was based upon assumptions that our management and management of the EQM General Partner believed appropriate at the time of execution. If any of the assumptions fail to occur, or if actual results differ from these assumptions, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits associated with the execution of the EQT Global GGA. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits associated with the EQT Global GGA will have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends. See \"EQT Global GGA\" in Note 18 for additional information.\nTherefore, any event, whether in EQM's areas of operations or otherwise, that adversely affects EQT's production, financial condition, leverage, results of operations or cash flows may adversely affect us. Accordingly, we are subject to the business risks of EQT, including the following:\n\u2022\nprevailing and projected natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and oil prices and the effect thereon of the supply of associated natural gas from oil wells in other formations such as the Permian Basin;\n\u2022\nthe proximity, capacity, cost and availability of gathering and transportation facilities, and other factors that result in differentials to benchmark prices;\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of capital on a satisfactory economic basis to fund EQT's operations and refinance existing indebtedness as it becomes due, any changes in EQT's credit ratings and the effects of EQT's credit support obligations on such availability;\n\u2022\nnatural gas price volatility or a sustained period of lower commodity prices may have an adverse effect on EQT's drilling operations, revenue, profitability, future rate of growth, creditworthiness and liquidity;\n\u2022\na further reduction in or slowing of EQT's anticipated drilling and production schedule, which would directly and adversely impact demand for EQM's services;\n\u2022\nthe costs of producing natural gas and the availability and costs of drilling rigs and crews and other equipment;\n\u2022\ninfrastructure capacity constraints and interruptions;\n\u2022\ngeologic considerations;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with the operation of EQT's wells and facilities, including potential environmental liabilities;\n\u2022\nEQT's ability to identify exploration, development and production opportunities based on market conditions;\n\u2022\nuncertainties inherent in projecting future rates of production, levels of reserves, and demand for natural gas, NGLs and oil;\n\u2022\nEQT's ability to develop additional reserves that are economically recoverable, to optimize existing well production and to sustain production, including by use of large-scale, sequential, highly choreographed drilling and hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022\nEQT\u2019s ability to achieve anticipated efficiencies associated with its strategic plan and to successfully execute on its announced de-levering plan;\n\u2022\nadverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation, including the availability of drilling permits, the regulation of hydraulic fracturing, the potential removal of certain federal income tax deductions with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development or additional state taxes on natural gas extraction, changes in tax laws and negative public perception regarding EQT's operations;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key personnel and/or the effectiveness of their replacements; and\n\u2022\nrisk associated with cyber security, environmental activists and other threats.\nOn January 13, 2020, EQT publicly announced a revised projected 2020 capital expenditure forecast of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion, an approximate $50 million reduction as compared to guidance provided by EQT in its third quarter 2019 earnings release (which indicated an approximate $525 million year-over-year reduction compared to EQT\u2019s prior full-year 2019 guidance). EQT may further reduce its capital spending in the future based on commodity prices or other factors. Unless EQM is successful in attracting significant new customers, its ability to maintain or increase the capacity subscribed and volumes transported or gathered under service arrangements on its gathering, transmission and storage and water systems will be dependent on receiving consistent or increasing commitments from EQT. While EQT has dedicated a significant amount of its acreage to, and executed long-term contracts with substantial firm reservation and MVCs on EQM's systems, it may determine in the future that drilling in areas outside of EQM's current areas of operations is strategically more attractive to it, and other than the MVCs, it is under no contractual obligation to maintain its production dedicated to EQM. Moreover, EQT's strategy continues to focus on capital efficiency and free cash flow generation as opposed to volume growth. Based on this strategy, on October 31, 2019, EQT publicly disclosed that its development program is expected to result in approximately flat sales volumes for 2020 relative to EQT\u2019s expectation as to 2019 levels. A reduction in the capacity subscribed or volumes transported or gathered on EQM's systems by EQT could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEQT may also elect to continue to reduce its drilling activity if commodity prices remain depressed or further decrease or it may elect to not grow its production unless commodity prices improve. Fluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of EQT\u2019s and other producers\u2019 respective reserves. In general terms, the prices of natural gas, oil and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond EQM's control. These factors include worldwide political and economic conditions, weather conditions and seasonal trends, the levels of domestic production and consumer demand, new exploratory finds of natural gas, the levels of imported and exported natural gas, oil and LNG, the availability of transportation systems with adequate capacity, the volatility and uncertainty of regional pricing differentials, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the effect of energy conservation measures, the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation, and the anticipated future prices of natural gas, oil, LNG and other commodities. Further declines in commodity prices could have a negative impact on EQT's and other producers\u2019 development and production activity, and if sustained, could lead to a material decrease in such activity. Due to these and other factors, even if reserves are known to exist in areas serviced by EQM's assets, producers have chosen, and may choose in the future, not to develop those reserves. Sustained reductions in development or production activity in EQM's areas of operation could lead to reduced utilization of EQM's services, including EQM\u2019s water services which are directly associated with producers\u2019 well completion activities and fresh and produced water needs (which are partially driven by horizontal lateral lengths and the number of completion stages per well).\nAny sustained reductions in development or production activity in EQM\u2019s areas of operation could adversely affect EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nDecreases in production of natural gas in EQM's areas of operation have adversely affected, and future decreases could further adversely affect, its business and operating results and reduce its cash available to make distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEQM's business is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas production and reserves in its areas of operation. A sustained low-price environment for natural gas or regulatory limitations could adversely affect development of additional reserves and production that is accessible by EQM's pipeline and storage assets and fresh water sources. Production from natural gas wells will naturally decline over time. The amount of natural gas reserves underlying these wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. Additionally, producers may determine in the future that drilling activities in areas outside of EQM's current areas of operations are strategically more attractive to them due to the price environment for natural gas or other reasons. A further reduction in the natural gas volumes supplied by producers could result in reduced throughput on EQM's systems and adversely impact its ability to sustain and grow its operations and maintain quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nAccordingly, maintaining or increasing the contracted capacity or the volume of natural gas gathered, transported and stored on EQM's systems and cash flows associated therewith, is substantially dependent on EQM's customers continually accessing additional reserves of natural gas.\nThe primary factors affecting EQM's ability to obtain non-dedicated sources of natural gas include the level of successful drilling activity near EQM's systems and EQM's ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells, and most development areas in EQM's area of operation are already dedicated to EQM or one of its competitors. While EQT has dedicated production from certain of its leased properties to EQM, EQM has no control over the level of drilling activity in its areas of operation, the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to EQM's gathering systems or the rate at which production from a well declines. In addition, EQM has no control over EQT or other producers or their drilling or production decisions, which are affected by, among other things, the availability and cost of capital, producers focus on generating free cash flow and/or delevering, prevailing and projected energy prices, demand for hydrocarbons, levels of reserves, the producers\u2019 contractual obligations to EQM and other midstream companies, geological considerations, environmental or other governmental regulations, the availability of drilling permits, the availability of drilling rigs and crews, and other production and development costs.\nFluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of new natural gas reserves. In general terms, the prices of natural gas, oil and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to certain factors such as those described under the heading \u201cEQM depends on EQT for a substantial majority of its revenues and future growth. Therefore, EQM is subject to the business risks of EQT, and any further decrease in EQT's drilling or completion activity could adversely affect EQM's business and operating results.\" For example, the daily spot prices for NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas ranged from a high of $4.25 per MMBtu to a low of $2.02 per MMBtu from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019. Low natural gas prices, particularly in the Appalachian Basin, have had a negative impact on exploration, development and production activity and on utilization of EQM\u2019s systems and, if sustained, could lead to a material decrease in such activity and further decreases in such utilization. Because of these factors, even if new natural gas reserves are known to exist in areas served by EQM's assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. Moreover, EQT and other producers may not develop the acreage they have dedicated to EQM. If reductions in drilling activity result in EQM's inability to maintain levels of contracted capacity and throughput, it could reduce EQM's revenue and impair its ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEQM does not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves connected to its systems. Accordingly, EQM does not have independent estimates of total reserves connected to its systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. If the total reserves or estimated life of the reserves connected to EQM's systems are less than EQM anticipates, or the timeline for the development of reserves is longer than EQM anticipates, and EQM is unable to secure additional sources of natural gas, there could be a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nIf new supplies of natural gas are not obtained to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing supply basins in EQM's areas of operation, or if natural gas supplies are diverted to serve other markets, the overall volume of natural gas gathered, transported and stored on EQM's systems would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nThe regulatory approval process for the construction of new midstream assets is challenging, and recent decisions by regulatory and judicial authorities in pending proceedings could impact EQM's or the MVP Joint Venture's ability to obtain all approvals and authorizations necessary to complete certain projects on the projected time frame or at all or EQM's ability to achieve the expected investment returns on the projects.\nCertain of EQM's internal growth projects require regulatory approval from federal, state and/or local authorities prior to construction, including any extensions from or additions to its transmission and storage system. The approval process for storage and transportation projects has become increasingly challenging, due in part to state and local concerns related to exploration and production, transmission and gathering activities in production areas, including the Marcellus and Utica Shales, and negative public perception regarding the oil and gas industry, including major pipeline projects like the MVP and MVP Southgate. Such authorization may not be granted or, if granted, such authorization may include burdensome or expensive conditions.\nIn addition, any significant delays in the regulatory approval process for the MVP project could increase costs and negatively impact the targeted in-service date for the MVP project of late 2020, which in turn could adversely affect the ability for the MVP Joint Venture and its owners, including EQM, to achieve the expected investment return. The MVP project is subject to\nseveral challenges that must be resolved before the MVP project can be completed, as described in more detail in \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\"\nAlthough the MVP Joint Venture is actively defending the relevant agency actions and judicial challenges to the project, and is in active dialogue with all of the affected agencies to resolve these issues and restore the affected permits, there is no guarantee as to how long the agency proceedings and judicial challenges will take to resolve, or whether the MVP Joint Venture will ultimately succeed in restoring the permits in their issued form or within the MVP Joint Venture's targeted time frame for placing the project in service. Additionally, as the MVP project nears completion, we anticipate increased opposition from activists in the form of lawsuits, intervention in regulatory proceedings and otherwise, which may be focused on the few remaining portions of the project. Such focused opposition may make it increasingly difficult to complete the project and place it in service within the targeted time frame or at all. These and other challenges could adversely affect EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nFollowing the MVP in-service date, the gathering fees payable by EQT to EQM (or its affiliates) set forth in the EQT Global GGA are subject to potential reductions for certain contract years set forth in the EQT Global GGA, conditioned upon the in-service date of the MVP, which provide for estimated aggregate fee relief of $270 million in the first year after the in-service date of the MVP, $230 million in the second year after the in-service date of the MVP and $35 million in the third year after the in-service date of the MVP. In addition, if the MVP in-service date has not occurred by January 1, 2022, EQT has an option, exercisable for a period of twelve months, to forgo $145 million of the gathering fee relief in the first year after the MVP in-service date and $90 million of the gathering fee relief in the second year after the MVP in-service date in exchange for a cash payment from EQM to EQT in the amount of $196 million. Any further delay in the MVP in-service date may prevent the Company from achieving the anticipated benefits associated with the execution of the EQT Global GGA. See \"EQT Global GGA\" in Note 18 for additional information.\nEQM's natural gas gathering, transmission and storage services are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make distributions.\nEQM's interstate natural gas transmission and storage operations are regulated by the FERC under the NGA and the NGPA and the regulations, rules and policies promulgated under those and other statutes. Certain portions of EQM's gathering operations are also rate-regulated by the FERC in connection with its interstate transmission operations. EQM's FERC-regulated systems operate pursuant to tariffs approved by the FERC that establish rates, cost recovery mechanisms and terms and conditions of service to its customers. Generally, the FERC's authority extends to:\n\u2022\nrates and charges for EQM's natural gas transmission and storage and FERC-regulated gathering services;\n\u2022\ncertification and construction of new interstate transmission and storage facilities;\n\u2022\nabandonment of interstate transmission and storage services and facilities and certificated gathering facilities;\n\u2022\nmaintenance of accounts and records;\n\u2022\nrelationships between pipelines and certain affiliates;\n\u2022\nterms and conditions of services and service contracts with customers;\n\u2022\ndepreciation and amortization policies;\n\u2022\nacquisitions and dispositions of interstate transmission and storage facilities; and\n\u2022\ninitiation and discontinuation of interstate transmission and storage services.\nInterstate pipelines may not charge rates or impose terms and conditions of service that, upon review by the FERC, are found to be unjust or unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential. The recourse rate that may be charged by EQM's interstate pipeline for its transmission and storage services is established through the FERC's ratemaking process. Alternatively, where authorized by FERC, EQM may charge market-based rates.\nPursuant to the NGA, existing interstate transmission and storage rates, terms and conditions of service, and contracts may be challenged by complaint and are subject to prospective change by the FERC. Additionally, rate increases, changes to terms and conditions of service and contracts proposed by a regulated interstate pipeline may be protested and such actions can be delayed and may ultimately be rejected by the FERC. EQM currently holds authority from the FERC to charge and collect (i) \"recourse rates,\" which are the maximum rates an interstate pipeline may charge for its services under its tariff, (ii) \"discount rates,\" which are rates below the \"recourse rates\" and above a minimum level, (iii) \"negotiated rates,\" which involve rates above or below the \"recourse rates,\" provided that the affected customers are willing to agree to such rates and that the FERC has approved the negotiated rate agreement, and (iv) market-based rates for some of EQM's storage services from which EQM derives a small portion of its revenues. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 96% of its contracted firm transmission capacity was subscribed by customers under negotiated rate agreements under its tariff, rather than recourse, discount or market rate contracts. There can be no guarantee that EQM will be allowed to continue to operate under such rate structures for the remainder of those assets' operating lives. Any successful challenge against rates charged for EQM's transmission and storage services could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nWhile the FERC does not generally regulate the rates and terms of service over facilities determined to be performing a natural gas gathering function, the FERC has traditionally regulated rates charged by interstate pipelines for gathering services performed on the pipeline's own gathering facilities when those gathering services are performed in connection with jurisdictional interstate transmission services. EQM maintains rates and terms of service in its tariff for unbundled gathering services performed on a portion of its gathering facilities that are connected to its transmission and storage system. Just as with rates and terms of service for transmission and storage services, EQM's rates and terms of services for its FERC-regulated gathering services may be challenged by complaint and are subject to prospective change by the FERC.\nThe FERC's jurisdiction extends to the certification and construction of interstate transmission and storage facilities, including, but not limited to, acquisitions, facility replacements and upgrades, expansions, and abandonment of facilities and services. While the FERC exercises jurisdiction over the rates and terms of service for EQM's FERC-regulated gathering services, these gathering facilities may not be subject to the FERC's certification and construction authority. Prior to commencing construction of new or existing interstate transmission and storage facilities, an interstate pipeline must obtain a certificate authorizing the construction, or file to amend its existing certificate, from the FERC. On April 19, 2018, the FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking information regarding whether, and if so how, it should revise its approach under its currently effective policy statement on the certification of new natural gas transportation facilities. The formal comment period in this proceeding closed on July 25, 2018. We cannot currently predict when the FERC will issue an order in the Notice of Inquiry proceeding or what action the FERC may take in any such order. If the FERC changes its existing certificate policy, it could impact EQM's ability to construct interstate pipeline facilities. Further, typically a significant expansion project requires review by a number of governmental agencies, including state and local agencies, whose cooperation is important in completing the regulatory process on schedule. Any agency's delay in the issuance of, or refusal to issue, authorizations or permits for one or more of these projects may mean that EQM will not be able to pursue these projects or that they will be constructed in a manner or with capital requirements that EQM did not anticipate. Such delays, refusals or resulting modifications to projects could materially and negatively impact the revenues and costs expected from these projects or cause EQM to abandon planned projects.\nFERC regulations also extend to the terms and conditions set forth in agreements for transmission and storage services executed between interstate pipelines and their customers. These service agreements are required to conform, in all material respects, with the forms of service agreements set forth in the pipeline's FERC-approved tariff. Non-conforming agreements must be filed with, and accepted by, the FERC. In the event that the FERC finds that an agreement is materially non-conforming, in whole or in part, it could reject or require EQM to seek modification of the agreement, or alternatively require EQM to modify its tariff so that the non-conforming provisions are generally available to all customers or class of customers.\nOn March 15, 2018, the FERC issued an order generally disallowing master limited partnership (MLP) owned pipelines from including an allowance for income taxes in their cost-of-service based recourse rates. Under its prior policy, the FERC had permitted all interstate pipelines to include an income tax allowance in the cost-of-service used as the basis for calculating their regulated recourse rates. The new policy did not establish a binding rule automatically disallowing income tax allowances in current FERC-approved rates, but rather provided notice of the FERC's general policy and intended course of action in future proceedings. On July 18, 2018, the FERC issued an order directed at natural gas pipelines that clarified its March 15, 2018 order, stating that an MLP will not be precluded in a future proceeding from making a claim that it is entitled to an income tax allowance based on a demonstration that its recovery of an income tax allowance does not result in a \u201cdouble-recovery of investors\u2019 income tax costs.\u201d The July 18, 2018 order also clarified the treatment of ADIT. Challenges to these orders are currently pending in a consolidated proceeding before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On October 17, 2018, an intervenor filed a motion to hold the proceeding in abeyance. On October 24, 2018, the\nFERC filed a motion to dismiss the proceeding. On January 31, 2019, the court denied the motion to hold the proceeding in abeyance and ordered that the motion to dismiss be referred to the panel to which the merits proceeding is assigned. Briefing on the merits was concluded on February 19, 2020, and the court scheduled oral arguments for April 3, 2020. We cannot currently predict when the court will act on the broader proceeding, or what actions the court may take. Also, on July 18, 2018, the FERC issued Order No. 849, adopting regulations requiring that natural gas pipelines make a one-time report, Form 501-G. For MLP-owned pipelines, the Form 501-G report was to calculate, among other things, an earned rate of return on equity that addresses any potential over-recovery of their cost of service arising from the general disallowance of the income tax allowance and the ADIT clarification. On December 28, 2018, Equitrans, L.P. filed its Form 501-G with the FERC. During the second quarter of 2019, EQM reached a settlement with all of its firm recourse rate transmission customers related to its FERC Form 501-G report. The FERC approved the settlement and terminated Equitrans, L.P.\u2019s Form No. 501-G proceeding during the second quarter of 2019. We cannot determine whether the FERC or any customer will initiate a rate case against us as a result of Equitrans, L.P.'s Form 501-G filing or for any other reason.\nAny changes to the FERC\u2019s policies regarding the natural gas industry may have an impact on EQM, including the FERC's approach to pro-competitive policies as it considers matters such as interstate pipeline rates and rules and policies that may affect rights of access to natural gas transmission capacity and transmission and storage facilities.\nSection 1(b) of the NGA exempts certain natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the FERC under the NGA. We believe that EQM's high-pressure natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests the FERC has used to establish a pipeline's status as an exempt gatherer not subject to regulation as a jurisdictional natural gas company, although the FERC has not made a formal determination with respect to the jurisdictional status of those facilities. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is often the subject of litigation within the industry, so the classification and regulation of EQM's high-pressure gathering systems are subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts or the U.S. Congress.\nFailure to comply with applicable provisions of the NGA, the NGPA, federal pipeline safety laws and certain other laws, as well as with the regulations, rules, orders, restrictions and conditions associated with these laws, could result in the imposition of administrative and criminal remedies and civil penalties. For example, the FERC is authorized to impose civil penalties of up to approximately $1.3 million per violation, per day for violations of the NGA, the NGPA or the rules, regulations, restrictions, conditions and orders promulgated under those statutes. This maximum penalty authority established by statute will continue to be adjusted periodically for inflation.\nIn addition, future federal, state or local legislation or regulations under which EQM will operate its natural gas gathering, transmission and storage businesses may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEQM may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis.\nOn February 26, 2020, EQM entered into the EQT Global GGA with EQT for the provision by EQM of gas gathering services to EQT in the Marcellus and Utica Shales of Pennsylvania and West Virginia. See \u201cEQT Global GGA\u201d in Note 18 for additional information.\nOne of EQM's exposures to market risk occurs at the time its existing contracts expire and are subject to renegotiation and renewal. Based on total projected contractual revenues, including projected contractual revenues from future capacity expected from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed for which EQM has executed firm contracts, EQM's firm gathering contracts and firm transmission and storage contracts had weighted average remaining terms of approximately 11 years and 14 years, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. The extension or replacement of existing contracts, depends on a number of factors beyond EQM's control, including:\n\u2022\nthe level of existing and new competition to provide services to EQM's markets;\n\u2022\nthe macroeconomic factors affecting natural gas economics for EQM's current and potential customers;\n\u2022\nthe balance of supply and demand, on a short-term, seasonal and long-term basis, in EQM's markets;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which the customers in EQM's markets are willing to contract on a long-term basis; and\n\u2022\nthe effects of federal, state or local regulations on the contracting practices of EQM's customers.\nAny failure to extend or replace a significant portion of EQM's existing contracts, or extending or replacing them at unfavorable or lower rates or with lower or no associated firm reservation fee revenues, could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nAdditionally, the execution of the EQT Global GGA was based upon assumptions that our management and management of the EQM General Partner believed appropriate at the time of execution. If any of the assumptions fail to occur, or if actual results differ from these assumptions, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits associated with the execution of the EQT Global GGA. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits associated with the EQT Global GGA will have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends.\nThe lack of diversification of EQM's assets and geographic locations could adversely affect its ability to make distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEQM relies exclusively on revenues generated from its gathering, transmission and storage and water systems, substantially all of which are located in the Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. Due to EQM's lack of diversification in assets and geographic location, an adverse development in these businesses or EQM's areas of operations, including adverse developments due to catastrophic events, weather, regulatory action, local prices, producer liquidity and decreases in demand for natural gas, specifically dry gas, from the Appalachian Basin could have a more significant impact on EQM's results of operations and distributable cash flow to its unitholders, including us, than if EQM maintained more diverse assets and locations (including, without limitation, as a result of an increase in associated natural gas produced from oil wells in other formations such as the Permian Basin).\nThe demand for the services provided by EQM's water services business could decline as a result of several factors.\nEQM's water service business includes fresh water distribution for use in EQM's customers' natural gas, NGL and oil exploration and production activities. Water is an essential component of natural gas, NGL and oil production during the drilling, and in particular, the hydraulic fracturing process. As a result, the demand for EQM's fresh water distribution and produced water handling services is tied to the level of drilling and completion activity of EQM's customers, including EQT (which is currently and anticipated to continue to be EQM's primary customer for such services). More specifically, the demand for EQM's water distribution and produced water handling services could be adversely affected by any further reduction in or slowing of EQT's or other customers' well completions, any reduction in produced water attributable to completion activity, or the extent to which EQT or other customers complete wells with shorter lateral lengths, which would lessen the volume of fresh water required for completion activity. In addition, increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in natural gas, NGL and oil production by EQM's water service customers, which could reduce the number of wells for which EQM provides water services.\nThe availability of EQM\u2019s water supply may be limited due to reasons including, but not limited to, prolonged drought, difficulty obtaining permits or regulatory delays associated with infrastructure development. Restrictions on the ability to obtain water, changes in wastewater disposal requirements, or changes in the regulation of water withdrawal and use may incentivize water recycling efforts by oil and natural gas producers, which could decrease the demand for EQM's fresh water distribution services.\nEQM may not be able to increase its customer throughput and resulting revenue due to competition and other factors, which could limit its ability to grow.\nPart of EQM's growth strategy includes diversifying its customer base by identifying opportunities to offer services to parties other than EQT. For example, the Bolt-on Acquisition provides opportunities for producer diversification. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, EQT accounted for approximately 72%, 80% and 88%, respectively, of EQM's gathering revenues and approximately 56%, 54% and 54%, respectively, of EQM's transmission and storage revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and for the period from November 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017, EQT accounted for approximately 89%, 93% and 99% of EQM's water service revenues, respectively. EQT accounted for approximately 69%, 74% and 74% of EQM's total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. EQM's ability to increase its customer-subscribed capacity and throughput and resulting revenue is subject to numerous factors beyond its control, including competition from third-party producers' existing contractual obligations to competitors and the extent to which EQM has available capacity when shippers require it. To the extent that EQM lacks available capacity on its systems for volumes, it may not be able to compete effectively with third-party systems for additional natural gas production in its areas of operation.\nEQM's efforts to attract new customers or larger commitments from existing customers may be adversely affected by EQM's desire to provide services pursuant to long-term firm contracts and contracts with MVCs. EQM's potential customers may prefer to obtain services under other forms of contractual arrangements under which EQM would be required to assume direct commodity exposure.\nEQM is exposed to the credit risk of its counterparties in the ordinary course of its business.\nEQM is exposed to the risk of loss resulting from the nonpayment and/or nonperformance of its customers, suppliers, joint venture partners and other counterparties as further described in \"Credit Risk\" under Item 7A. EQM extends credit to its customers, including EQT as its largest customer, as a normal part of EQM's business. As of February 26, 2020, EQT\u2019s public debt had sub-investment grade credit ratings of BB+ at S&P, Ba1 at Moody's, and BB at Fitch, each with a negative outlook, following downgrades at each of the rating agencies during the first quarter of 2020. While EQM has established credit policies, including assessing the creditworthiness of its customers as permitted by its FERC-approved natural gas tariffs, and may require appropriate terms or credit support from them based on the results of such assessments, including in the form of prepayments, letters of credit, or guaranties, EQM may not have adequately assessed the creditworthiness of its existing or future customers. In connection with the execution of the EQT Global GGA and the Credit Letter Agreement, amongst other things, (a) EQM agreed to relieve certain credit posting requirements for EQT, in an amount up to approximately $250 million under its commercial agreements with EQM, subject to EQT maintaining a minimum credit rating from two of three rating agencies of (i) Ba3 with Moody\u2019s, (ii) BB- with S&P and (iii) BB- with Fitch and (b) EQM agreed to use commercially reasonable good faith efforts to negotiate similar credit support arrangements for EQT in respect of its commitments to the MVP Joint Venture. We cannot predict the extent to which the businesses of EQM's counterparties, including EQT, would be impacted if commodity prices further decline, commodity prices are depressed for a sustained period of time, or other conditions in the energy industry were to further deteriorate, nor can we estimate the impact such conditions would have on the abilities of EQM's customers to perform under their gathering, transmission and storage and water service agreements with EQM. The low commodity price environment has negatively impacted natural gas producers causing some producers in the industry significant economic stress including, in certain cases, to file for bankruptcy protection or to renegotiate contracts. To the extent one or more of EQM's counterparties, including EQT, is in financial distress or commences bankruptcy proceedings, contracts with these counterparties may be subject to renegotiation or rejection under applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Any resulting nonpayment and/or nonperformance by EQM's counterparties could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nIncreased competition from other companies that provide gathering, transmission and storage, and water services, or from alternative fuel sources, could have a negative impact on the demand for EQM's services, which could adversely affect its financial results.\nEQM's ability to renew or replace existing contracts at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of its competitors. EQM's systems compete primarily with other interstate and intrastate pipelines and storage facilities in the gathering, transmission and storage of natural gas. Some of EQM's competitors have greater financial resources, and may be better positioned to compete as the midstream industry moves towards greater consolidation, and may now, or in the future, have access to greater supplies of natural gas or water than EQM does. Some of these competitors may expand or construct gathering systems, transmission and storage systems and water systems that would create additional competition for the services EQM provides to its customers. In addition, EQM's customers may develop their own gathering, transmission or storage, or water services instead of using EQM's.\nThe policies of the FERC promoting competition in natural gas markets are having the effect of increasing the natural gas transmission and storage options for EQM's traditional customer base. As a result, EQM could experience some \"turnback\" of firm capacity as existing agreements expire. If EQM is unable to remarket this capacity or can remarket it only at substantially discounted rates compared to previous contracts, EQM may have to bear the costs associated with the turned back capacity. Increased competition could reduce the volumes of natural gas transported or stored on EQM's systems or, in cases where EQM does not have long-term firm contracts, could force EQM to lower its transmission or storage rates. Increased competition could also adversely affect demand for EQM's water services.\nFurther, natural gas as a fuel competes with other forms of energy available to end-users, including coal, liquid fuels and renewable and alternative energy. Increased demand for such forms of energy, particularly renewable and alternative energy, at the expense of natural gas could lead to a reduction in demand for natural gas gathering, transmission and storage, and water services.\nAll of these competitive pressures could make it more difficult for EQM to retain its existing customers and/or attract new customers and/or additional volumes from existing customers as EQM seeks to maintain and expand its business, which could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us. In addition, competition could intensify the negative impact of factors that decrease demand for natural gas in the markets served by EQM's systems, such as adverse economic conditions, weather, higher fuel costs and taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that directly or indirectly increase the cost or limit the use of natural gas.\nIf third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to EQM's pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport or process natural gas, EQM's revenues and cash available to make distributions to its unitholders could be adversely affected.\nEQM depends on third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide receipt and delivery options to and from EQM's transmission and storage system. For example, EQM's transmission and storage system interconnects with the following interstate pipelines: Texas Eastern, Dominion Transmission, Columbia Gas Transmission, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, Rockies Express Pipeline LLC, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation and ET Rover Pipeline, LLC, as well as multiple distribution companies. Similarly, EQM's gathering systems have multiple delivery interconnects to multiple interstate pipelines. In the event that EQM's access to such systems was impaired, the amount of natural gas that EQM's gathering systems can gather and transport would be adversely affected, which could reduce revenues from EQM's gathering activities as well as transmission and storage activities. Because EQM does not own these third-party pipelines or facilities, their continuing operation is not within EQM's control. If these or any other pipeline connections or facilities were to become unavailable for current or future volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other reason, EQM's ability to operate efficiently and continue shipping natural gas to end markets could be restricted. Any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect or facility could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nCertain of the services EQM provides on its transmission and storage system are subject to long-term, fixed-price \"negotiated rate\" contracts that are subject to limited or no adjustment, even if EQM's cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts, and, as a result, EQM's costs could exceed its revenues received under such contracts, or EQM could be unable to achieve the expected investment return under such contracts.\nIt is possible that costs to perform services under \"negotiated rate\" contracts will exceed the negotiated rates EQM has agreed to provide to its customers. If this occurs, it could decrease the cash flow realized by EQM's systems and, therefore, the cash EQM has available for distribution to its unitholders, including us. Under FERC policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to a \"negotiated rate,\" and that contract must be filed with and accepted by the FERC. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 96% of the contracted firm transmission capacity on EQM's system was subscribed under such \"negotiated rate'' contracts. Unless the parties to these \"negotiated rate\" contracts agree otherwise, the contracts generally may not be adjusted to account for increased costs that could be caused by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services.\nIf the tariffs governing the services EQM provides are successfully challenged, EQM could be required to reduce its tariff rates, which could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nCustomers, the FERC or other interested stakeholders, such as state regulatory agencies, may challenge EQM's rates offered to customers or the terms and conditions of service included in EQM's tariffs. EQM does not have an agreement in place that would prohibit customers, including EQT or its affiliates, from challenging EQM's tariffs. If any challenge were successful, among other things, the recourse rates that EQM charges on its systems could be reduced. Successful challenges could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us. See \"EQM's natural gas gathering, transmission and storage services are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make distributions.\"\nIf EQM does not complete expansion projects, its future growth may be limited.\nEQM's ability to grow depends primarily upon its ability to complete expansion projects, including, without limitation, the MVP, MVP Southgate and Hammerhead projects, that result in an increase in the cash EQM generates. EQM may be unable to complete successful, accretive expansion projects for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nan inability to identify attractive expansion projects;\n\u2022\nan inability to obtain necessary rights-of-way, real-estate rights or permits or other government approvals, including approvals by regulatory agencies;\n\u2022\nan inability to successfully integrate the infrastructure EQM builds;\n\u2022\nan inability to raise financing for expansion projects on economically acceptable terms;\n\u2022\nincorrect assumptions about volumes, revenues and costs, including potential growth; or\n\u2022\nan inability to secure adequate customer commitments to use the newly expanded facilities.\nIn addition, EQM's ability to secure required permits and rights-of-way or otherwise proceed with construction of its expansion projects has been impacted by opposition from political and other activists, who may attempt to delay pipeline construction through protests, vandalism and other means, as has recently occurred with respect to the MVP.\nExpanding EQM's business by constructing new midstream assets subjects EQM to risks.\nOrganic and greenfield growth projects are a significant component of EQM's growth strategy. The development and construction of pipelines and storage facilities involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties beyond EQM's control and requires the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. The development and construction of pipeline infrastructure and storage facilities expose EQM to construction risks such as the failure to meet customer contractual requirements, delays caused by landowners, advocacy groups or activists opposed to the natural gas industry, environmental hazards, vandalism, adverse weather conditions, the performance of third-party contractors, the lack of available skilled labor, equipment and materials and the inability to obtain necessary rights-of-way or approvals and permits from regulatory agencies on a timely basis or at all (and maintain such rights-of-way, approvals and permits once obtained). These types of projects may not be completed on schedule, at the budgeted cost or at all. Moreover, EQM's revenues may not increase for some time after completion of a particular project. For instance, EQM is required to pay construction costs generally as they are incurred but construction typically occurs over an extended period of time, and EQM will not receive revenues or material increases in revenues until the project is placed into service. Moreover, EQM may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production and/or demand in a region in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve EQM's expected investment return, which could adversely affect EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEQM faces and will continue to face opposition to the development or operation of its pipelines and facilities from various groups.\nEQM faces and will continue to face opposition to the development or operation of its pipelines and facilities from environmental groups, landowners, local and national groups, activists and other advocates. Such opposition could take many forms, including organized protests, attempts to block, vandalize or sabotage EQM's development or operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving its assets directly or indirectly, lawsuits, legislation or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the development or operation of its assets and business. For example, repairing EQM's pipelines often involves securing consent from individual landowners to access their property; one or more landowners may resist EQM's efforts to make needed repairs, which could lead to an interruption in the operation of the affected pipeline or other facility for a period of time that is significantly longer than would have otherwise been the case. In addition, acts of sabotage or eco-terrorism could cause significant damage or injury to people, property or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of EQM's operations. Any such event that delays or interrupts the revenues generated, or expected to be generated, by EQM's operations, or which causes it to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could reduce its cash available for distribution to its unitholders, including us, and, accordingly, adversely affect our financial condition and the market price of our securities.\nRecently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention towards, among other things, sources of funding for fossil fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other\nsources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in energy-related activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult for exploration and production companies to secure funding for exploration and production activities, for midstream companies to secure funding for energy infrastructure related projects and/or all such companies\u2019 ability to access capital to refinance existing debt, and consequently could both indirectly affect demand for EQM's services and directly affect its ability to fund construction or other capital projects.\nEQM has entered into joint ventures, and may in the future enter into additional or modify existing joint ventures, that might restrict its operational and corporate flexibility. In addition, these joint ventures are subject to many of the same operational risks to which EQM is subject.\nEQM has entered into joint ventures to construct the MVP and MVP Southgate projects and a joint venture relating to Eureka Midstream and may in the future enter into additional joint venture arrangements with third parties. Joint venture arrangements may restrict EQM's operational and corporate flexibility. Joint venture arrangements may also divert management and operating resources in a manner that is disproportionate to EQM\u2019s ownership percentage in such ventures. Because EQM does not control all of the decisions of the MVP Joint Venture or the joint venture relating to Eureka Midstream, it may be difficult or impossible for EQM to cause these joint ventures to take actions that EQM believes would be in EQM's or the joint venture's best interests. For example, EQM cannot unilaterally cause the distribution of cash by the MVP Joint Venture or Eureka Midstream. Moreover, joint venture arrangements involve various risks and uncertainties, such as committing EQM to fund operating and/or capital expenditures, the timing and amount of which EQM may not control, and EQM's joint venture partners may not satisfy their financial obligations to the joint venture. In addition, the operations of the MVP Joint Venture, Eureka Midstream and any joint ventures we or EQM may enter into in the future are subject to many of the same operational risks to which EQM is subject to.\nAcquisitions EQM may make could reduce, rather than increase, its cash generated from operations on a per unit basis.\nIf EQM makes acquisitions that it believes will be accretive, these acquisitions may nevertheless result in a decrease in the cash generated from operations on a per unit basis. Any acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nmistaken assumptions about volumes, revenues and costs, including synergies and potential growth;\n\u2022\nan inability to secure adequate customer commitments to use the acquired systems or facilities;\n\u2022\nan inability to integrate successfully the assets or businesses EQM acquires;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities for which EQM is not indemnified or for which EQM's indemnity is inadequate;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management's and employees' attention from other business concerns; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties operating in new geographic areas or business lines.\nIf any acquisition fails to be accretive to EQM's distributable cash flow per unit, it could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nReviews of our goodwill and intangible and other long-lived assets have resulted in and could result in future significant impairment charges.\nGAAP requires us to perform an assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.\nWe may perform either a qualitative or quantitative assessment of potential impairment. Our qualitative assessment of potential impairment may result in the determination that a quantitative impairment analysis is not necessary. Under this elective process, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads us to determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing a quantitative analysis is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, then we perform a quantitative impairment analysis. If we choose not to perform a qualitative assessment, or if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment but are unable to qualitatively conclude that no impairment has occurred, then we will perform a quantitative assessment. In the case of a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit with which the goodwill is associated and compare it to the carrying value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value.\nAssessing the recoverability of goodwill requires significant judgments and estimates by management. Fair values of goodwill are primarily estimated using discounted cash flows based on forecasts of financial results that incorporate assumptions including, but not limited to, the discount rate, terminal value factor, peer groups, control premiums and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization multiples. All of our goodwill as of December 31, 2019 relates to businesses that were acquired and valued by EQT's management in the Rice Merger. The reporting unit to which goodwill is recorded as of December 31, 2019 is the Pennsylvania gathering assets acquired in the Rice Merger (RMP PA Gas Gathering). The Company's reporting units earn a significant portion of their revenues from volumetric-based fees, which are sensitive to changes in development plans of the Company's customers.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we determined that the fair value of the Ohio gathering assets acquired in the Drop-down Transaction (Rice Retained Midstream) was greater than its carrying value; however, the carrying values of RMP PA Gas Gathering and the Ohio and West Virginia gathering assets acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition (Eureka/Hornet) were each greater than their respective fair values. As a result, we recognized impairment of goodwill of $168.9 million and $99.2 million on RMP PA Gas Gathering and Eureka/Hornet, respectively. The non-cash impairment charge is included in the impairments of long-lived assets line on our statements of consolidated comprehensive income.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment assessment, we concluded the performance of a quantitative impairment assessment was required. Factors contributing to this conclusion were the continued decline of our market capitalization in the fourth quarter and the sustained declines in producer drilling activity driven by market conditions, including natural gas prices.\nConsistent with the third quarter 2019 interim goodwill impairment assessment, we used the income approach\u2019s discounted cash flow method and the market approach\u2019s comparable company and reference transaction methods. During our fourth quarter 2019 impairment assessment, we determined that the carrying values of RMP PA Gas Gathering and Rice Retained Midstream were each greater than their respective fair values. As a result, we recognized impairment of goodwill of $433.2 million and $150.5 million on RMP PA Gas Gathering and Rice Retained Midstream, respectively. The non-cash impairment charge is included in the impairments of long-lived assets line on our statements of consolidated comprehensive income.\nWe evaluate long-lived assets, including related intangibles, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Asset recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group with its expected future pre-tax undiscounted cash flows. These cash flow estimates require us to make projections and assumptions for many years into the future for pricing, demand, competition, operating cost and other factors. If the carrying amount exceeds the expected future undiscounted cash flows, we recognize an impairment equal to the excess of net book value over fair value as determined by quoted market prices in active markets or present value techniques if quotes are unavailable. The determination of the fair value using present value techniques requires us to make projections and assumptions regarding the probability of a range of outcomes and the rates of interest used in the present value calculations. Any changes we make to these projections and assumptions could result in significant revisions to its evaluation of recoverability of our property, plant and equipment and the recognition of additional impairments.\nIf the operations or projected operating results of EQM's businesses decline significantly, we could incur additional goodwill impairment charges. Future impairment charges could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the impairment is recorded. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $486.7 million of goodwill (all associated with RMP PA Gas Gathering) and $8.5 billion of long-lived assets, including intangibles which will be monitored for future impairment. Management will continue to monitor and evaluate the factors underlying the fair market value of acquired businesses and assets to determine if any assessments are necessary and will take any additional impairment charges required. Moreover, the Company will be required to evaluate the provisions of the EQT Global GGA and related commercial transactions with EQT to ascertain whether such provisions may, among other\nthings, require the Company to reevaluate its reporting units for goodwill impairment or otherwise evaluate whether any impairment indicators may be present with respect to the Company\u2019s long-lived assets. See \"EQT Global GGA\" in Note 18 for additional information.\nIf EQM is unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms to fund expansions of its asset base or acquisitions, its ability to make quarterly cash distributions may be diminished or its financial leverage could increase. There is no commitment from the EQM General Partner or the Company to provide any direct or indirect financial assistance to EQM.\nIn order to expand EQM's asset base and complete announced expansion projects, including the MVP and MVP Southgate, EQM will need to make significant expansion capital expenditures. If EQM does not make sufficient or effective capital expenditures, it will be unable to expand its business operations, which impacts EQM's ability to pay quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nIn order to fund its capital expenditures, EQM will be required to use cash from its operations, incur borrowings or sell additional partnership units. Using cash from operations will reduce distributable cash flow to EQM's common unitholders, including us. EQM's ability to obtain bank financing or to access the capital markets for future equity or debt offerings may be limited by its financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering, its credit ratings, the covenants in EQM's debt agreements, general economic conditions, conditions in our industry, changes in law (including tax laws), and other contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond EQM's control. As of February 26, 2020, EQM and EQT had sub-investment grade credit ratings at each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch. See \"A further downgrade of EQM's credit ratings, including in connection with the MVP project or changes in the credit ratings of EQT, which are determined by independent third parties, could impact EQM's liquidity, access to capital, and cost of doing business.\" Furthermore, market demand for equity issued by master limited partnerships has been significantly lower in recent years than it has been historically, which has made it challenging for EQM to finance its capital expenditures with the issuance of equity in the capital markets or through private placements. Additionally, global financial markets and economic conditions have been, and continue to be, volatile, especially for companies involved in the oil and gas industry. The repricing of credit risk and the recent relatively weak economic conditions in the oil and gas industry have made, and will likely continue to make, it difficult for some entities to obtain funding on favorable terms. Furthermore, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets generally has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased rates, enacted tighter lending standards, refused to refinance existing debt at maturity or at all or on terms similar to the borrower\u2019s current debt, and reduced, or in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers. As a result, even if EQM is successful in obtaining funds for capital expenditures through equity or debt financings, the terms thereof could limit its ability to pay distributions to its unitholders, including us. In addition, incurring additional debt may significantly increase EQM's interest expense and financial leverage, and issuing additional partner interests may result in significant common unitholder dilution and increase the aggregate amount of cash required to maintain the then-current distribution rates, which could materially decrease EQM's ability to pay distributions at the then-current distribution rates, and our ability to pay dividends. If funding is not available to EQM when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, EQM may be unable to execute its business plans, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us. There is no commitment from the EQM General Partner or the Company to provide any direct or indirect financial assistance to EQM.\nEQM is subject to numerous hazards and operational risks.\nEQM's business operations are subject to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to the gathering, transmission and storage of natural gas and performance of water services. These operating risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ndamage to pipelines, facilities, equipment, environmental controls and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, abnormal amounts of rainfall, floods, fires, droughts, landslides and other natural disasters and acts of sabotage, vandalism and terrorism;\n\u2022\ninadvertent damage from construction, vehicles, and farm and utility equipment;\n\u2022\nuncontrolled releases of natural gas and other hydrocarbons;\n\u2022\nleaks, migrations or losses of natural gas as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities and, with respect to storage assets, as a result of undefined boundaries, geologic anomalies, natural pressure migration and wellbore migration;\n\u2022\nruptures, fires and explosions;\n\u2022\npipeline freeze offs due to cold weather; and\n\u2022\nother hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution to the environment and suspension of operations.\nThese risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of EQM's operations, regulatory investigations and penalties and substantial losses to EQM. The location of certain segments of EQM's systems in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the damages resulting from these risks. In spite of any precautions taken, an event such as those described above could cause considerable harm to people, property or the environment and could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us. Accidents or other operating risks could further result in loss of service available to EQM's customers. Such circumstances, including those arising from maintenance and repair activities, could result in service interruptions on segments of EQM's systems. Potential customer impacts arising from service interruptions on segments of EQM's systems could include limitations on its ability to satisfy customer requirements, obligations to provide reservation charge credits to customers in times of constrained capacity, and solicitation of EQM's existing customers by others for potential new projects that would compete directly with EQM's existing services. Such circumstances could adversely impact EQM's ability to meet contractual obligations and retain customers, with a resulting negative impact on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nNegative public perception regarding EQM, MVP, MVP Southgate, other EQM projects, the midstream industry, and/or the natural gas industry in general could have an adverse effect on EQM's operations.\nNegative public perception regarding EQM, the MVP, MVP Southgate, other EQM projects, the midstream industry and/or the natural gas industry in general resulting from, among other things, climate change, oil spills, the explosion of natural gas transmission and gathering lines, erosion and sedimentation issues, and general concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing and pipeline projects, has led to, and may in the future lead to, increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new local, state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. See \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\" These actions have caused, and may continue to cause, operational delays or restrictions, increased construction and operating costs, penalties under construction contracts, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. As discussed under \"The regulatory approval process for the construction of new midstream assets is challenging, and recent decisions by regulatory and judicial authorities in pending proceedings could impact EQM's or the MVP Joint Venture's ability to obtain all approvals and authorizations necessary to complete certain projects on the projected time frame or at all or EQM's ability to achieve the expected investment returns on the projects,\" there are several pending challenges to certain aspects of the MVP project that must be resolved before the MVP project can be completed. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Our, EQM\u2019s and the MVP Joint Venture\u2019s respective reputations and public opinion regarding us, EQM, the MVP, MVP Southgate and other EQM projects may be negatively impacted by the actions and activities of other companies operating in the energy industry, particularly other energy infrastructure providers, over which we, EQM and the MVP Joint Venture have no control. In particular, public perception could be impacted by negative publicity related to pipeline incidents or unpopular expansion projects and due to opposition to the development of hydrocarbons and energy infrastructure, particularly projects involving resources that are considered to increase GHG emissions and contribute to climate change. Negative public perception could cause the permits EQM and the MVP Joint Venture need to complete the MVP and MVP Southgate projects and conduct their operations to be removed, withheld, delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict their ability to profitably conduct business or make it more difficult to obtain the real property interests EQM and the MVP Joint Venture need in order to operate their assets or complete planned growth projects, which could result in revenue loss or a reduction in EQM\u2019s and the MVP Joint Venture\u2019s customer bases.\nAdditionally, certain candidates running for President of the United States have advocated for policies that call for a complete halt on hydraulic fracturing on public and private lands. A ban on hydraulic fracturing would directly affect the commercial viability of EQM\u2019s customers and would have a materially adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nWe do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.\nEQM is not fully insured against all risks inherent in its business, including environmental accidents that might occur as well as many cyber events. In addition, EQM does not maintain business interruption insurance of the types and in amounts necessary to cover all possible risks of loss, like project delays caused by governmental action or inaction. The occurrence of any operating risks not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nWe currently maintain excess liability insurance that covers our and our affiliates', including EQM's, legal and contractual liabilities arising out of bodily injury, personal injury or property damage, including resulting loss of use, to third parties. This excess liability insurance includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution liability but excludes: release of pollutants subsequent to their disposal; release of substances arising from the combustion of fuels that result in acidic deposition; and testing, monitoring, clean-up, containment, treatment or removal of pollutants from property owned, occupied by, rented to, used by or in the care, custody or control of us and our affiliates, including EQM. We also maintain coverage for us and our affiliates, including EQM, for physical damage to assets and resulting business interruption, including damage caused by terrorist acts.\nMost of our insurance is subject to deductibles or self-insured retentions. If a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not fully insured, it could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance for ourselves and our affiliates, including EQM, of the types and in the amounts we desire at reasonable rates, and we may elect to self-insure a portion of our asset portfolio. The insurance coverage we have obtained or may obtain may contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain hazards or cover all potential losses. In addition, for pre-Distribution losses, we share insurance coverage with EQT, and we will remain responsible for payment of any deductible or self-insured amounts under those insurance policies. To the extent we experience a pre-Distribution loss that would be covered under EQT's insurance policies, our ability to collect under those policies may be reduced to the extent EQT erodes the limits under those policies.\nTerrorist or cyber security attacks or threats thereof aimed at EQM's pipelines or facilities or surrounding areas and new laws and regulations governing data privacy could adversely affect EQM and us.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications, to operate our assets, and the maintenance of our financial and other records has long been dependent upon such technologies. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Deliberate attacks on, or unintentional events affecting, our systems or infrastructure, the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data and potentially sensitive data, delays in delivery of natural gas and NGLs, difficulty in completing and settling transactions, challenges in maintaining our books and records, communication interruptions, environmental damage, personal injury, property damage and other operational disruptions, as well as damage to our reputation, financial condition and cash flows. Further, as cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. In addition, new U.S. laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of personal information may potentially elevate our compliance costs. Any failure by us or EQM to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a cyber incident, could result in significant penalties and liability to us or EQM. Additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result.\nEQM is subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that may expose it to significant costs and liabilities.\nEQM's operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels. Laws, regulations and other legal requirements have increased the cost to plan, design, install, operate and abandon gathering, transmission and water systems and pipelines. Environmental, health and safety legal requirements govern discharges of substances into the air, water and ground; the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; the clean-up of contaminated sites; groundwater quality and availability; plant and wildlife protection; locations available for pipeline construction; environmental impact studies and assessments prior to permitting; restoration of properties after construction or operations are completed; pipeline\nsafety (including replacement requirements); and work practices related to employee health and safety. Compliance with the laws, regulations and other legal requirements applicable to EQM's business, including delays in obtaining permits or other government approvals, may increase EQM's cost of doing business, result in delays or restrictions in the performance of operations due to the need to obtain additional or more detailed permits or other governmental approvals or even cause EQM not to pursue a project. For example, the Department of Interior\u2019s U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) continues to receive hundreds of petitions to consider listing of additional species as endangered or threatened and is being regularly sued or threatened with lawsuits to address these petitions. Some of these legal actions may result in the listing of species located in areas in which EQM operates. Such designations of previously unprotected species as being endangered or threatened, or the designation of previously unprotected areas as a critical habitat for such species, can result in increased costs, construction delays, restrictions in EQM's operations or abandonment of projects. Listing of aquatic species could potentially affect water supplies or delay related infrastructure development. As discussed under \"The regulatory approval process for the construction of new midstream assets is challenging, and recent decisions by regulatory and judicial authorities in pending proceedings could impact EQM's or the MVP Joint Venture's ability to obtain all approvals and authorizations necessary to complete certain projects on the projected time frame or at all or EQM's ability to achieve the expected investment returns on the projects,\" there are several pending challenges to certain aspects of the MVP project, including to the MVP Joint Venture\u2019s Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement issued by FWS which was approved in November 2017. See the discussion of the litigation and regulatory-related delays in \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\" In addition, compliance with laws, regulations or other legal requirements could subject EQM to claims for personal injuries, property damage and other damages. EQM's failure to comply with the laws, regulations and other legal requirements applicable to its business, even if as a result of factors beyond its control, could result in the suspension or termination of its operations and subject EQM to administrative, civil and criminal penalties and damages.\nLaws, regulations and other legal requirements are constantly changing, and implementation of compliant processes in response to such changes could be costly and time consuming. For example, in October 2015, the EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone from 75 parts per billion for the current 8-hour primary and secondary ozone standards to 70 parts per billion for both standards. The EPA may designate the areas in which EQM operates as nonattainment areas. States that contain any areas designated as nonattainment areas will be required to develop implementation plans demonstrating how the areas will attain the applicable standard within a prescribed period of time. These plans may require the installation of additional equipment to control emissions. In addition, in May 2016, the EPA finalized rules that impose volatile organic compound emissions limits (and collaterally reduce methane emissions) on certain types of compressors and pneumatic pumps, as well as requiring the development and implementation of leak monitoring plans for compressor stations. The EPA finalized amendments to some requirements in these standards in March 2018 and September 2018, including rescission of certain requirements and revisions to other requirements such as fugitive emissions monitoring frequency. Compliance with these or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of EQM's equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase EQM's capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact EQM's business. In addition to periodic changes to air, water and waste laws, as well as recent EPA initiatives to impose climate change-based air regulations on industry, the U.S. Congress and various states have been evaluating climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would further restrict emissions of GHGs, including methane (a primary component of natural gas) and carbon dioxide (a byproduct of burning natural gas). Several states are also pursuing similar measures to regulate emissions of GHGs from new and existing sources. If implemented, such GHG restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to, or taxes on the release, capture and use of, GHGs that could have an adverse effect on EQM's operations.\nThere is a risk that EQM may incur costs and liabilities in connection with its operations due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices, its handling of wastes and potential emissions and discharges related to EQM's operations. Private parties, including the owners of the properties through which EQM's gathering system or its transmission and storage system pass and facilities where its wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to require remediation of contamination or enforce compliance with environmental requirements as well as to seek damages for personal injury or property damage. In addition, changes in environmental laws occur frequently, and any such changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us. EQM may not be able to recover all or any of these costs from insurance.\nClimate change and related legislation, regulatory initiatives and litigation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the services EQM provides.\nLegislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and GHG emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation. The EPA regulates GHG emissions from new and modified facilities that are potential major sources of criteria pollutants under the Clean Air Act's Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V programs and has adopted\nregulations that require, among other things, preconstruction and operating permits for certain large stationary sources and the monitoring and reporting of GHGs from certain onshore oil and natural gas production sources on an annual basis.\nIn addition, in 2015, the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which was signed by the U.S. in April 2016, requires countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their intended nationally determined contributions (which set GHG emission reduction goals) every five years beginning in 2020. While the current U.S. administration announced its intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in June 2017, under the agreement\u2019s terms the earliest the U.S. can withdraw is 2020. There are no guarantees that the agreement will not be re-implemented in the U.S., or re-implemented in part by specific U.S. states or local governments. The U.S. Congress, along with federal and state agencies, has also considered measures to reduce the emissions of GHGs. Legislation or regulation that restricts carbon emissions could increase EQM's cost of environmental compliance by requiring it to install new equipment to reduce emissions from larger facilities and/or, depending on any future legislation, purchase emission allowances. The effect of climate change legislation or regulation on EQM\u2019s business is currently uncertain. If EQM incurs additional costs to comply with such legislation or regulations, it may not be able to pass on the higher costs to its customers or recover all the costs related to complying with such requirements and any such recovery may depend on events beyond EQM\u2019s control, including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the FERC or state regulatory agencies and the provisions of any final legislation or implementing regulations. EQM\u2019s future results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could be adversely affected if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates or otherwise passed on to its customers. Additionally, EQM\u2019s customers or suppliers may also be affected by legislation or regulation, which may adversely impact their drilling schedules and production volumes and reduce the volumes delivered to EQM and demand for its services. Climate change and GHG legislation or regulation could delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain and maintain permits and other regulatory approvals for existing and new facilities, impose additional monitoring and reporting requirements or adversely affect demand for the natural gas EQM gathers, transports and stores. The effect on EQM of any new legislative or regulatory measures will depend on the particular provisions that are ultimately adopted.\nFurthermore, certain scientific studies conclude that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may effect climate changes, which could result in the increased severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects occur, there may be adverse effects on EQM\u2019s assets and operations.\nSignificant portions of EQM's pipeline systems have been in service for several decades. There could be unknown events or conditions, or increased maintenance or repair expenses and downtime associated with its pipelines that could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make distributions.\nSignificant portions of EQM's transmission and storage system and FERC-regulated gathering system have been in service for several decades. The age and condition of these systems could result in increased maintenance or repair expenditures, and any downtime associated with increased maintenance and repair activities could materially reduce EQM's revenue. Any significant increase in maintenance and repair expenditures or loss of revenue due to the age or condition of EQM's systems could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEQM may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of increasingly stringent pipeline safety regulation, including pipeline integrity management program testing and related repairs.\nThe DOT, acting through PHMSA, has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transmission pipelines located where a leak or rupture could harm HCAs, including high population areas, unless the operator effectively demonstrates by risk assessment that the pipeline could not affect the area. The regulations require operators, including EQM, to:\n\u2022\nperform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;\n\u2022\nidentify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact an HCA;\n\u2022\nmaintain processes for data collection, integration and analysis;\n\u2022\nrepair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and\n\u2022\nimplement preventive and mitigating actions.\nChanges to pipeline safety laws and regulations that result in more stringent or costly safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on EQM and similarly situated midstream operators. For example, in April 2016, PHMSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing several integrity management topics and proposing new requirements to address safety issues for natural gas transmission and gathering lines. The proposed rule would strengthen existing integrity management requirements, expand assessment and repair requirements to pipelines in areas with medium population densities and extend regulatory requirements to onshore gas gathering lines that are currently exempt. This rule has not been finalized. Further, in June 2016, then-President Obama signed the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act that extended PHMSA's statutory mandate under prior legislation through 2019. Although a reauthorization bill extending PHMSA's statutory mandate until 2023 was introduced in 2019, Congress did not pass the bill in 2019 and PHMSA is operating under a continuing resolution until a new bill is passed. In addition, the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act empowered PHMSA to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing and also required PHMSA to develop new safety standards for natural gas storage facilities by June 2018. Pursuant to those provisions of the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act, PHMSA issued two Interim Final Rules in October 2016 and December 2016 that expanded the agency's authority to impose emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures and strengthened the rules related to underground natural gas storage facilities, including well integrity, wellbore tubing and casing integrity. The December 2016 Interim Final Rule, relating to underground gas storage facilities, went into effect in January 2017. PHMSA determined, however, that it will not issue enforcement citations to any operators for violations of provisions of the December 2016 Interim Final Rule that had previously been non-mandatory provisions of American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practices 1170 and 1171 until one year after PHMSA issues a final rule. Although PHMSA issued a press release in January 2020 stating that it has submitted a final rule for publication, as of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the final rule has not yet been published or made publicly available. On October 19, 2017, PHMSA formally reopened the comment period in response to a petition for reconsideration. This matter remains ongoing and subject to future PHMSA determinations. Additionally, in January 2017, PHMSA announced a new final rule regarding hazardous liquid pipelines, which increases the quality and frequency of tests that assess the condition of pipelines, requires operators to annually evaluate the existing protective measures in place for pipeline segments in HCAs, extends certain leak detection requirements for hazardous liquid pipelines not located in HCAs, and expands the list of conditions that require immediate repair. However, it is unclear when or if this rule will go into effect because, on January 20, 2017, the Trump Administration requested that all regulations that had been sent to the Office of the Federal Register, but were not yet published, be immediately withdrawn for further review. Accordingly, this rule has not become effective through publication in the Federal Register. PHMSA published three final rules on pipeline safety: Enhanced Emergency Order Procedures; Safety of Hazardous Liquid Pipelines; and Safety of Gas Transmission Pipelines: Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure Reconfirmation, Expansion of Assessment Requirements, and Other Related Amendments. The Enhanced Emergency Order Procedures rule, which became effective on December 2, 2019, implements an existing statutory authorization for PHMSA to issue emergency orders related to pipeline safety if an unsafe condition or practice, or a combination of unsafe conditions and practices, constitutes, or is causing an imminent hazard. The Safety of Hazardous Liquid Pipelines rule, which goes into effect on July 1, 2020, expands PHMSA\u2019s regulation of the safety of hazardous liquid pipelines by extending reporting requirements to certain hazardous liquid, gravity flow and rural gathering pipelines, establishing new requirements for integrity management programs for hazardous liquid pipelines in HCAs and certain onshore hazardous liquid pipelines located outside of HCAs, extending leak detection requirements to all non-gathering hazardous liquid pipelines, requiring new or replaced pipelines to be designed and built to accommodate in-line inspection devices, and requiring operators to inspect affected pipelines following an extreme weather event or natural disaster so they may address any resulting damage. The Safety of Gas Transmissions Pipelines rule, which goes into effect on July 1, 2020, requires operators of certain gas transmission pipelines that have been tested or that have inadequate records to determine the material strength of their lines by reconfirming the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure, and establishes a new Moderate Consequence Area for determining regulatory requirements for gas transmission pipeline segments outside of HCAs. The rule also establishes new requirements for conducting baseline assessments, incorporates into the regulations industry standards and guidelines regarding design, construction and in-line inspections, and new requirements for data integration and risk analysis in integrity management programs, including seismicity, manufacturing and construction defects, and crack and crack-like defects, and includes several requirements that allow operators to notify PHMSA of proposed alternative approaches to achieving the objectives of the minimum safety standards. EQM is in the process of assessing the impact of these rules on its future costs of operations and revenue from operations.\nStates are generally preempted by federal law in the area of pipeline safety, but state agencies may qualify to assume responsibility for enforcing federal regulations over intrastate pipelines. They may also promulgate additive pipeline safety regulations provided that the state standards are at least as stringent as the federal standards. Although many of EQM's natural gas facilities fall within a class that is not subject to integrity management requirements, EQM may incur significant costs and liabilities associated with repair, remediation, preventive or mitigation measures associated with its non-exempt transmission pipelines. The costs, if any, for repair, remediation, preventive or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as\na result of the testing program, as well as lost cash flows resulting from shutting down EQM's pipelines during the pendency of such actions, could be material.\nShould EQM fail to comply with DOT regulations adopted under authority granted to PHMSA, it could be subject to penalties and fines. PHMSA has the authority to impose civil penalties for pipeline safety violations up to a maximum of approximately $210,000 per day for each violation and approximately $2.1 million for a related series of violations. This maximum penalty authority established by statute will continue to be adjusted periodically to account for inflation. In addition, EQM may be required to comply with new safety regulations and make additional maintenance capital expenditures in the future for similar regulatory compliance initiatives that are not reflected in its forecasted maintenance capital expenditures.\nThe adoption of legislation relating to hydraulic fracturing and the enactment of new or increased severance taxes and impact fees on natural gas production could cause EQM's current and potential customers to reduce the number of wells they drill in the Marcellus and Utica Shales or curtail production of existing wells. If reductions are significant for those or other reasons, the reductions would have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEQM's assets are primarily located in the Marcellus Shale fairway in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia and the Utica Shale fairway in eastern Ohio, and a substantial majority of the production that EQM receives from customers is produced from wells completed using hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and gas wells, particularly in unconventional resource plays like the Marcellus and Utica Shales. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions and similar agencies, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over aspects of the process, including the EPA, which finalized effluent limit guidelines allowing zero discharge of waste water from shale gas extraction operations to a publicly owned treatment plant in 2016 in addition to existing limits on direct discharges. Additionally, in response to increased public concern regarding the alleged potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the performance of such activities using diesel fuels. The federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has also asserted regulatory authority over aspects of the process, and issued a final rule in March 2015 that established more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The BLM rule was struck down by a federal court in Wyoming in June 2016, but was reinstated on appeal by the Tenth Circuit in September 2017. While this appeal was pending, BLM proposed a rulemaking in July 2017 to rescind these rules in their entirety. BLM published a final rule rescinding the 2015 rules in December 2017. However, other federal or state agencies may look to the BLM rule in developing new regulations that could apply to EQM's operations.\nThe U.S. Congress has from time to time considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, while a growing number of states, including those in which EQM operates, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent disclosure and/or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. Some states, such as Pennsylvania, have imposed fees on the drilling of new unconventional oil and gas wells. States could elect to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether, as was announced in December 2014 with regard to hydraulic fracturing activities in New York. Also, certain local governments have adopted, and additional local governments may further adopt, ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. Further, several federal governmental agencies are conducting reviews and studies on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing, including the EPA. For example, in December 2016, the EPA issued its final report on a study it had conducted over several years regarding the effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water sources. The final report, contrary to several previously published draft reports issued by the EPA, found instances in which impacts to drinking water may occur. However, the report also noted significant data gaps that prevented the EPA from determining the extent or severity of these impacts. The results of such reviews or studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.\nState and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the hydraulic fracturing related activities and the increased occurrence of seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In a few instances, operators of injection disposal wells in the vicinity of seismic events have been ordered to reduce injection volumes or suspend operations. Some state regulatory agencies, including those in Colorado, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas, have modified their regulations to account for induced seismicity. While Pennsylvania is not one of the states where such regulation has been enacted, regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection disposal wells and hydraulic fracturing. Such regulations and restrictions could cause delays and impose additional costs and restrictions on EQM's customers.\nThe adoption of new laws, regulations or ordinances at the federal, state or local levels imposing more stringent restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult for EQM's customers to complete natural gas wells, increase customers' costs of compliance and doing business, and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact demand for EQM's gathering, transmission and storage, or water services.\nFurthermore, the tax laws, rules and regulations that affect EQM's customers are subject to change. For example, Pennsylvania's governor has in recent legislative sessions proposed legislation to impose a state severance tax on the extraction of natural resources, including natural gas produced from the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations, either in replacement of or in addition to the existing state impact fee. Pennsylvania\u2019s legislature has not thus far advanced any of the governor\u2019s severance tax proposals; however, severance tax legislation may continue to be proposed in future legislative sessions. Any such tax increase or change could adversely impact the earnings, cash flows and financial position of EQM's customers and cause them to reduce their drilling in the areas in which EQM operates.\nEQM's exposure to direct commodity price risk may increase in the future.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, approximately 58%, 54% and 84%, respectively, of EQM's revenues were generated from firm reservation fees. The decrease from 2017 to 2018 reflects the inclusion of RMP's gathering systems for a full year compared to the period from November 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017, as RMP's gathering systems are not supported by contracts with firm reservation fee components. Rather, all of RMP's gathering revenues are generated under long-term interruptible service contracts. As a result, following the Rice Merger, EQM has greater exposure to short- and medium-term declines in volumes of gas produced and gathered on its systems. Although EQM intends to execute long-term firm contracts with new customers in the future, its efforts to obtain such contractual terms may not be successful. Most of EQM's water service agreements are volumetric in nature and therefore are more sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices and downturns in production by EQM's customers in the future. In addition, EQM may acquire or develop additional midstream assets in the future that do not provide services primarily based on capacity reservation charges or other fixed fee arrangements and therefore have a greater exposure to fluctuations in commodity price risk than its current operations. Exposure to the volatility of natural gas prices, including regional basis differentials, as a result of EQM's contracts could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nSee \u201cEQT Global GGA\u201d and \u201cWater Services Letter Agreement\u201d in Note 18 regarding additional MVCs on gathering and water services from EQT.\nEQM does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt its operations and future development.\nEQM does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities have been constructed, and it is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms, and/or increased costs or delays, to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid rights-of-way, if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate or if its facilities are not properly located within the boundaries of such rights-of-way. Although many of these rights are perpetual in nature, EQM occasionally obtains the rights to construct and operate its pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. If EQM were to be unsuccessful in negotiating or renegotiating rights-of-way, it might have to institute condemnation proceedings on its FERC-regulated assets or relocate its facilities for non-regulated assets. A loss of rights-of-way or a relocation could have a material adverse effect on EQM's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us. Additionally, even when EQM owns an interest in the land on which its pipelines and facilities have been constructed, agreements with correlative rights owners may require EQM to relocate pipelines and facilities, shut in storage facilities to facilitate the development of the correlative rights owners' estate, or pay the correlative rights owners the lost value of their estate if they are not willing to accommodate development.\nEQM's significant indebtedness, and any future indebtedness, as well as the restrictions under EQM's and its subsidiaries\u2019 debt agreements, could adversely affect its operating flexibility, business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nEQM's and Eureka Midstream\u2019s respective debt agreements contain various covenants and restrictive provisions that limit EQM's and Eureka Midstream\u2019s, as applicable, ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022\nmake distributions on or redeem or repurchase units;\n\u2022\nincur or permit liens on assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into certain mergers or acquisitions; and\n\u2022\ndispose of all or substantially all of their respective assets.\nIn October 2018, EQM amended and restated its credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity from $1 billion to $3 billion and extend the term to October 2023 (the EQM Credit Facility). In August 2019, EQM entered into a term loan agreement that provided for unsecured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $1.4 billion (the 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement), which term loans mature in August 2022. Additionally, Eureka Midstream, LLC (Eureka), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eureka Midstream, has a $400 million senior secured revolving credit facility that matures in August 2021. The EQM Credit Facility and 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement each contain a covenant requiring EQM to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 5.00 to 1.00 (or not more than 5.50 to 1.00 for certain measurement periods following the consummation of certain acquisitions). Under Eureka\u2019s credit facility, Eureka is required to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 (or not more than 5.25 to 1.00 for certain measurement periods following the consummation of certain acquisitions). Additionally, as of the end of any fiscal quarter, Eureka may not permit the ratio of consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Eureka credit facility) for the four fiscal quarters then ending to consolidated interest charges to be less than 2.50 to 1.00. EQM's and Eureka\u2019s ability to meet these covenants can be affected by events beyond their respective control and EQM cannot assure its unitholders that it or Eureka will meet these covenants. In addition, the EQM Credit Facility, the 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement and the Eureka credit facility each contain events of default customary for such facilities, including the occurrence of a change of control. Furthermore, in June 2018, EQM issued senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion, consisting of $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of its 4.75% senior notes due 2023, $850 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.50% senior notes due 2028, and its $550 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.50% senior notes due 2048.\nThe provisions of EQM's debt agreements may affect EQM's ability to obtain future financing and pursue attractive business opportunities and its flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. In addition, a failure to comply with the provisions of EQM's debt agreements could result in an event of default, which could enable EQM's creditors to, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable agreement, declare any outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. If the payment of EQM's debt is accelerated, EQM's assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and its unitholders and our shareholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investments. The EQM Credit Facility and 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement also have cross default provisions that apply to any other indebtedness EQM may have with an aggregate principal amount in excess of $25 million.\nEQM and its subsidiaries may in the future incur additional debt. EQM's and its subsidiaries\u2019 levels of debt could have important consequences to EQM, including the following:\n\u2022\nEQM's ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired, or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;\n\u2022\nEQM's funds available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions to unitholders, including us, will be reduced by that portion of its cash flow required to make interest payments on its debt;\n\u2022\nEQM may be more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in its business or the economy generally; and\n\u2022\nEQM's flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions may be limited.\nEQM's and its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to service their respective debts will depend upon, among other things, their future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond their control. If EQM's operating results are not sufficient to service its current or future indebtedness, EQM will be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying its business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets or seeking additional equity capital. EQM may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all.\nSee the description of the \"Intercompany Loan\" in Note 18.\nEQM's substantial indebtedness and the additional debt EQM and/or its subsidiaries will incur in the future for, among other things, working capital, capital expenditures, capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture, acquisitions or operating activities may adversely affect EQM's liquidity and therefore its ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us.\nIn addition, EQM's significant indebtedness may be viewed negatively by credit rating agencies, which could result in increased costs for EQM or us to access the capital markets. Any future additional downgrade of the debt issued by EQM or its subsidiaries could significantly increase its capital costs or adversely affect EQM's or our ability to raise capital in the future.\nA further downgrade of EQM's credit ratings, including in connection with the MVP project or changes in the credit ratings of EQT, which are determined by independent third parties, could impact EQM's liquidity, access to capital, and costs of doing business.\nOn January 31, 2020, Moody's affirmed EQM's Ba1 credit rating but changed its outlook from stable to negative, citing uncertainty around the MVP project and EQT's weakening credit profile. Further, on February 4, 2020, S&P downgraded EQM to a BB+ rating, with a negative outlook, from a BBB- rating, citing a downgrade of EQT's credit rating from BBB- to BB+, with a negative outlook, on February 3, 2020, as well as pressure on EQM's leverage metrics and distribution coverage, as the principle reasons for the ratings action. On February 27, 2020, S&P further downgraded EQM to a BB rating, with a stable outlook, from BB+, with a negative outlook, citing increased leverage as a result of the announcement of the EQM Merger as the rationale for taking action on our credit rating. On February 18, 2020, Fitch downgraded EQM to a BB rating, with a negative outlook, from a BBB- rating, citing a downgrade of EQT's credit rating from BBB- to BB, with a negative outlook, on February 14, 2020, as well as uncertainty around the MVP project, as the principal reasons for the ratings action. If any credit rating agency further downgrades EQM's credit ratings, including for reasons relating to the MVP project, EQM's leverage or the credit ratings of our customers (including EQT), EQM's access to credit markets may be limited, EQM's borrowing costs could increase, and EQM may be required to provide additional credit assurances in support of commercial agreements, such as joint venture agreements and, if applicable, construction contracts, the amount of which may be substantial. As a result of the downgrades, EQM was obligated to deliver additional credit support to the MVP Joint Venture, which includes letters of credit in the amounts of approximately $220.2 million and $14.2 million with respect to the MVP project and the MVP Southgate project, respectively.\nIn order to be considered investment grade, EQM must be rated Baa3 or higher by Moody's, BBB- or higher by S&P and BBB- or higher by Fitch. EQM's non-investment grade credit ratings by Moody's, S&P and Fitch and any future downgrade has resulted in greater borrowing costs, including under the EQM Credit Facility and 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement and increased collateral requirements, including under the MVP Joint Venture\u2019s limited liability company agreement, than would be available to EQM if its credit ratings were investment grade. EQM's ability to access capital markets could also be limited by economic, market or other disruptions. A further increase in the level of EQM's indebtedness, future delays in the MVP project or increases in such project\u2019s costs or further deterioration in the credit ratings of EQM\u2019s customers in the future may result in further downgrades in the ratings that are assigned to its debt. Credit rating agencies perform an independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. This analysis includes a number of criteria such as business composition, market and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. Credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. Credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies.\nAny further downgrade could also lead to higher borrowing costs on our current and for future borrowings and could require:\n\u2022\nadditional or more restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on EQM and its subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nEQM's subsidiaries to guarantee such debt and certain other debt; and\n\u2022\nEQM and its subsidiaries to provide collateral to secure such debt.\nAny increase in EQM's financing costs or additional or more restrictive covenants resulting from a credit rating downgrade could adversely affect our ability to finance future operations. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant collateral requirement were to occur at a time when EQM is experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, EQM's results of operations could be adversely affected.\nChanges in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate, or the replacement of the London Interbank Offered Rate with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.\nAmounts drawn under our and EQM's respective credit facilities may bear interest at rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. Our and EQM's respective credit facilities provide for mechanisms to amend the facilities to reflect the establishment of an alternative rate of interest upon the occurrence of certain events related to the phase-out of LIBOR. However, we and EQM have not yet pursued any technical amendments or other contractual alternatives to address this matter and are currently evaluating the impact of the potential replacement of the LIBOR interest rate. In addition, the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential phase-out and alternative reference rates or disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Us\nWe own our only cash-generating assets through our ownership interests in EQM. Because of this structure, our cash flow is completely dependent upon quarterly cash distributions from EQM to its partners, including us.\nOur cash flow and liquidity depends primarily on EQM's cash flow and ability to make quarterly distributions to us as partners of EQM. EQM may make cash distributions during periods when EQM records a loss for financial reporting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when EQM records net earnings for financial reporting purposes.\nThe amount of cash that EQM can distribute each quarter to its partners, including us, principally depends upon the amount of cash EQM generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe rates EQM charges for EQM's gathering, transmission, storage and water services;\n\u2022\nthe level of EQM\u2019s MVCs, firm gathering, transmission and storage capacity sold and the volumes of natural gas EQM gathers, transports and stores for its customers and EQM\u2019s ability to provide produced water handling services, the volume of water delivered to, or stored for, EQM\u2019s customers and the cost of water;\n\u2022\nEQM\u2019s ability to successfully implement or execute on its business plan;\n\u2022\nregional, domestic and foreign supply (including, without limitation, associated natural gas produced from oil wells in other formations such as the Permian Basin) and perceptions of supply of natural gas; the level of demand and perceptions of demand in EQM's end-use markets (which may be met or otherwise affected by production of associated gas and the availability of such gas in EQM\u2019s end-use markets); and actual and anticipated future prices of natural gas and other commodities (and the volatility thereof), which may affect, among other things, production volumes, customer financial health, and EQM's ability to renew and replace firm gathering, transmission and storage, and water services agreements;\n\u2022\nthe effect of seasonal variations in temperature on the amount of natural gas that EQM gathers, transports and stores and the amount of water EQM delivers;\n\u2022\nthe level of competition from other midstream energy companies in EQM's geographic markets;\n\u2022\nthe creditworthiness and defaults, if any, of EQM's customers, including EQT;\n\u2022\nrestrictions contained in EQM's joint venture agreements;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of distributions, if any, received by EQM under its joint venture agreements;\n\u2022\nthe level of EQM's operating and maintenance and general and administrative costs;\n\u2022\nthe availability and price of alternative and competing fuel sources, and the rates of growth of alternative energy sources and consumer adoption of alternative energy sources relative to natural gas;\n\u2022\nregulatory action affecting the supply of, or demand for, natural gas, the rates EQM can charge on its assets, how EQM contracts for services, EQM's existing contracts, EQM's operating costs and EQM's operating flexibility;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, weather-related delays, casualty losses, third-party opposition to EQM\u2019s operations in the form of protests, sabotage, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings, or lawsuits, and other matters beyond our or EQM\u2019s control;\n\u2022\nthe ultimate terms of renegotiation of EQM\u2019s commercial contracts with EQT and timing of the completion, if any, of such negotiations; and\n\u2022\nprevailing market conditions.\nIn addition, the actual amount of cash EQM will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, including:\n\u2022\nEQM\u2019s cash flows, including cash flow from operations and working capital borrowings;\n\u2022\nthe level and timing of capital expenditures and capital contributions EQM makes;\n\u2022\nthe level of EQM\u2019s operating and maintenance and general and administrative expenses;\n\u2022\nEQM's ability to successfully identify and consummate joint ventures and other transactions, including strategic acquisitions, if any, and to successfully integrate those acquisitions into EQM's business;\n\u2022\nthe cost of EQM\u2019s acquisitions, if any;\n\u2022\nEQM's and its subsidiaries\u2019 respective debt service requirements and other liabilities;\n\u2022\ndistributions to the holders of EQM Series A Preferred Units;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in EQM's working capital needs;\n\u2022\nliquidity and financing requirements, including EQM's ability to borrow funds and access capital markets on satisfactory terms or at all;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on distributions contained in EQM's and its subsidiaries\u2019 respective debt and joint venture agreements;\n\u2022\nthe amount of EQM's cash reserves; and\n\u2022\nother business risks affecting EQM's cash levels.\nBecause of these factors, EQM may not have sufficient available cash (as defined in EQM's partnership agreement) each quarter to pay quarterly distributions and may not be able to make cash distributions during periods when it records net income for financial accounting purposes. On February 27, 2020, EQM announced its intention to reduce its quarterly distribution from $1.16 per unit to $0.3875 per unit, a decrease of approximately 67% per unit, in connection with the announcement of the EQM Merger, commencing with the first quarter 2020 distribution. On February 27, 2020, the Company also announced its intention to reduce its quarterly dividend from $0.45 per share to $0.15 per share, a decrease of approximately 67% per share, in connection with the announcement of the EQM Merger, commencing with the first quarter 2020 dividend.\nPlease read \"Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to EQM's Business\" for a discussion on risks affecting EQM's ability to generate cash flow.\nEQM\u2019s Series A Preferred Units have rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to the rights of, holders of EQM common units, including us.\nEQM\u2019s Series A Preferred Units rank senior to the EQM common units with respect to distribution rights and rights upon liquidation. These preferences could adversely affect the market price for EQM common units or could make it more difficult for us or EQM to sell EQM common units in the future.\nIn addition, until the conversion of the EQM Series A Preferred Units into EQM common units or their redemption in connection with a change of control, holders of the EQM Series A Preferred Units will receive cumulative quarterly distributions initially at a fixed rate of $1.0364 per EQM Series A Preferred Unit per quarter for the first twenty distribution periods following the Private Placement (the \u201cinitial distribution period\u201d) and thereafter the quarterly distributions on the Series A Preferred Units will be an amount per Series A Preferred Unit for such quarter equal to (i) the Series A Preferred Unit purchase price of $48.77 per such unit, multiplied by (ii) a percentage equal to the sum of (A) the greater of (x) the 3-month LIBOR as of the second London banking day prior to the beginning of the applicable quarter and (y) 2.59%, and (B) 6.90%, multiplied by (iii) 25%. EQM is not permitted to pay any distributions on any junior securities, including on any of the EQM common units, prior to paying the quarterly distribution payable on the EQM Series A Preferred Units, including any previously accrued and unpaid distributions. In addition, because the distribution rate on the EQM Series A Preferred Units will become a floating rate following the initial distribution period, EQM is unable to predict the amount of such distributions. EQM\u2019s obligation to pay distributions on the EQM Series A Preferred Units could impact EQM\u2019s liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions, distributions on junior securities, including on the EQM common units, and other general partnership purposes. EQM\u2019s obligations to the holders of the EQM Series A Preferred Units could also limit EQM\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing or increase its borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on EQM\u2019s financial condition.\nSee EQM Merger in Note 18 for the treatment of the Series A Preferred Units in connection with the EQM Merger.\nEQM may issue additional EQM common units and, subject to certain limitations, other equity interests ranking equal or junior to the EQM Series A Preferred Units without unitholder approval, which would dilute the existing ownership interests of EQM\u2019s common unitholders, including us, and increase the risk that EQM will not have sufficient available cash to maintain its current cash distribution level.\nEQM\u2019s partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests that, with respect to distributions on such partnership interests and distributions upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of EQM, rank junior to the EQM Series A Preferred Units, including the EQM common units and Class B units, that EQM may issue at any time without the approval of its unitholders. Subject to certain limited exceptions, the issuance of additional EQM Series A Preferred Units and partnership interests that rank equal to or senior to the EQM Series A Preferred Units requires the consent of the holders of two-thirds (66 2/3%) of the outstanding EQM Series A Preferred Units. The issuance by EQM of additional EQM common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank would have the following effects:\n\u2022\nEQM\u2019s existing unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in EQM would decrease;\n\u2022\nthe amount of distributable cash flow on each unit may decrease;\n\u2022\nEQM\u2019s ability to maintain its current cash distribution level may be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nthe ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase;\n\u2022\nthe relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit will be diminished; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of EQM common units may decline.\nThe value of our stock price has a correlation with the value of the EQM limited partner interests that we hold. Additional EQM limited partner interest issuances will have a dilutive effect on EQM's earnings per unit, which could adversely affect the market price of EQM's common units. If EQM were to issue additional limited partner interests, it would have a dilutive effect on our economic interests in EQM. Additionally, any conversion of EQM Series A Preferred Units to EQM common units, whether at the holders\u2019 election or at EQM\u2019s election, would increase the number of EQM common units outstanding, which in turn may impact the amount of any distributions paid in respect of the EQM common unitholders, including us.\nThe terms of the EQM Series A Preferred Units contain covenants that may limit EQM\u2019s business flexibility.\nFollowing completion of the EQM Merger, EQM's common units will no longer be publicly traded.\nThe terms of the EQM Series A Preferred Units contain covenants that prevent EQM from taking certain actions without the approval of the holders of two-thirds (66 2/3%) of the outstanding EQM Series A Preferred Units, voting as a separate class. The need to obtain the approval of holders of the EQM Series A Preferred Units before taking these actions could impede\nEQM\u2019s ability to take certain actions that management or the Board of Directors of the EQM General Partner may consider to be in the best interests of EQM\u2019s unitholders, including us.\nThe affirmative vote of two-thirds (66 2/3%) of the outstanding EQM Series A Preferred Units, voting as a separate class, is necessary to, among other things, (i) amend EQM\u2019s partnership agreement or certificate of limited partnership in any manner that is adverse (other than in a de minimis manner) to any of the rights, preferences and privileges of the EQM Series A Preferred Units, (ii) issue any additional EQM Series A Preferred Units or any class or series of partnership interests that, with respect to distributions on such partnership interests or distributions in respect of such partnership interests upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of EQM, rank equal to or senior to the EQM Series A Preferred Units, subject to certain exceptions, (iii) reduce the distribution amount applicable to the EQM Series A Preferred Units, change the form of payment of distributions on the EQM Series A Preferred Units, defer the date from which distributions on the EQM Series A Preferred Units will accrue, cancel any accrued and unpaid distributions on the EQM Series A Preferred Units or any interest accrued thereon (including any unpaid distributions or partial distributions on the EQM Series A Preferred Units), or change the seniority rights of the EQM Series A Preferred Units as to the payment of distributions in relation to the holders of any other class or series of partnership interests in EQM, (iv) reduce the amount payable or change the form of payment to the record holders of the EQM Series A Preferred Units upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets, of EQM, or change the seniority of the liquidation preferences of the record holders of the EQM Series A Preferred Units in relation to the rights of the holders of any other class or series of partnership interests in EQM upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of EQM or (v) make the EQM Series A Preferred Units redeemable or convertible at the option of EQM other than as set forth in EQM\u2019s partnership agreement.\nSee \"EQM Merger\" in Note 18 for the treatment of the Series A Preferred Units in connection with the EQM Merger.\nThe tax treatment of EQM depends on its status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as well as it not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation by individual states. If the IRS were to treat EQM as a corporation or if EQM becomes subject to additional amounts of entity-level taxation for state or foreign tax purposes, it would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to us.\nWe own, directly or indirectly, a 59.9% limited partner interest in EQM, which consists of 117,245,455 EQM common units and 7,000,000 Class B units (excluding the Series A Preferred Units). Accordingly, the value of our investment in EQM, as well as the anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our shares, depends largely on EQM being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, which requires that 90% or more of EQM's gross income for every taxable year consist of qualifying income, as defined in Section 7704 of the Code.\nDespite the fact that EQM is a limited partnership under Delaware law and has not elected to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, it is possible, under certain circumstances, for EQM to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. A change in EQM's business could cause EQM to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject EQM to federal income taxation as an entity. For example, EQM would be treated as a corporation if less than 90% of EQM's gross income for any taxable year consists of \"qualifying income\" within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code.\nIf EQM was treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, EQM would pay federal income tax on its taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently 21.0%, and would likely pay state income taxes at varying rates. Distributions to EQM's partners (including us) would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to EQM's partners. Because a tax would be imposed upon EQM as a corporation, its cash available for distribution would be substantially reduced. Therefore, treatment of EQM as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to us, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our shares.\nCurrent law may change, causing EQM to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subjecting EQM to entity-level taxation. In addition, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. Imposition of any entity-level taxes on EQM will reduce its cash available for distribution to its partners.\nThe tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships such as EQM could be subject to potential legislative, judicial, or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.\nThe present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including EQM, may be modified by legislative, judicial, or administrative changes, or interpretations of applicable law at any time. Any modifications to the U.S.\nfederal income tax laws that may be applied retroactively or prospectively could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the expectation of future cash distributions or reduce the cash available for dividends to our shareholders. For example, from time to time, members of the U.S. Congress propose and consider such substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. If enacted, the proposals could eliminate the qualifying income exception to the treatment of all publicly traded partnerships as corporations upon which EQM relies for its treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted, but it is possible that a change in law could affect EQM and may, if enacted, be applied retroactively. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of our investments in EQM, and therefore our shares.\nFollowing completion of the EQM Merger, EQM's common units will no longer be publicly traded.\nIf the IRS makes audit adjustments to EQM's income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, the IRS (and some states) may assess and collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from EQM, in which case EQM may require its unitholders (including us) and potentially former unitholders to reimburse EQM for such payment or, if EQM is required to bear such payment, EQM's cash available for distribution to its unitholders (including us) might be substantially reduced.\nPursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to EQM's income tax return for tax years beginning after 2017, the IRS (and some states) may assess and collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable interest and penalties) directly from EQM. EQM will have a limited ability to shift any such tax liability to its general partner and unitholders, including us, in accordance with their interests in EQM during the year under audit, but there can be no assurance that EQM will be able to (or will choose to) do so under all circumstances, or that EQM will be able to (or will choose to) effect corresponding shifts in state income or similar tax liability resulting from the IRS adjustment in states in which EQM does business in the year under audit or in the adjustment year. If EQM makes payments of taxes, penalties and interest resulting from audit adjustments, EQM may require its unitholders, including us, and potentially former unitholders to reimburse it for such payment or, if EQM is required to bear such payment, EQM's cash available for distribution to its unitholders, including us, might be substantially reduced. Additionally, EQM may be required to allocate an adjustment disproportionately among its unitholders, causing its publicly traded units to have different capital accounts, which could negatively impact the value of our investment in EQM, unless the IRS issues further guidance.\nIn the event the IRS makes an audit adjustment to EQM's income tax returns and EQM does not or cannot shift the liability to its unitholders in accordance with their interests in EQM during the year under audit, EQM will generally have the ability to request that the IRS reduce the determined underpayment by reducing the suspended passive loss carryovers of EQM's unitholders (without any compensation from EQM to such unitholders), to the extent such underpayment is attributable to a net decrease in passive activity losses allocable to certain partners. Such reduction, if approved by the IRS, will be binding on any affected unitholders.\nIf in the future we cease to manage and control EQM, we may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nIf we cease to manage and control EQM, and as a result we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act), we will either have to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, obtain exemptive relief from the SEC or modify our organizational structure or our contractual rights to fall outside the definition of an investment company. Registering as an investment company could, among other things, materially limit our ability to engage in transactions with affiliates, including the purchase and sale of certain securities or other property to or from our affiliates, restrict our ability to borrow funds or engage in other transactions involving leverage, require us to add additional directors who are independent of us and our affiliates, and adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe credit and risk profile of EQM affect our credit ratings and risk profile, and any adverse changes in EQM's credit and risk profile could increase our borrowing costs or hinder our ability to raise capital.\nThe credit and business risk profiles of EQM are considered in credit evaluations of us. For example, on February 4, 2020, S&P downgraded EQM's credit rating from BBB- to BB+. As a result, S&P also downgraded our credit rating on February 4, 2020 from BB to BB- citing EQM's downgrade as the rationale for taking action on our rating. On February 27, 2020, S&P further downgraded EQM to a BB rating, with a stable outlook, from BB+, with a negative outlook, citing increased leverage as a result of the announcement of the EQM Merger as the rationale for taking action on our credit rating. However, S&P upgraded the Company's credit rating to BB, with a stable outlook, from BB-, with a negative outlook, citing the single economic entity that will result from the EQM Merger as the rationale for taking action on our credit rating. Further, on February 18, 2020,\nFitch downgraded EQM to a BB rating, with a negative outlook, from a BBB- rating, citing a downgrade of EQT's credit rating from BBB- to BB, with a negative outlook, as well as uncertainty around the MVP project, as principal reasons for the rating action. Fitch also downgraded the Company's credit rating from BB to B+ with a negative outlook to credit rating and the credit rating specifically related to its term loan B from BB to B with a negative outlook. This is because our only cash-generating assets are our ownership interests in EQM, and our cash flow is therefore completely dependent upon the ability of EQM to make quarterly cash distributions to its partners, including us. Due to our relationship with EQM, our ability to access the capital markets, or the pricing or other terms of any capital markets transactions, may be adversely affected by any impairments to EQM's financial condition, including the degree of its financial leverage, further adverse changes in its credit ratings and the level of its distributions to its unitholders. Any material limitations on our ability to access capital as a result of adverse changes at EQM could limit our ability to obtain future financing under favorable terms, or at all, or could result in increased financing costs in the future. Similarly, material adverse changes at EQM could negatively impact our share price, limiting our ability to raise capital through equity issuances or debt financing, could negatively affect our ability to engage in, expand or pursue our business activities, and could also prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us. On February 27, 2020, EQM announced its intention to reduce its quarterly distribution from $1.16 per unit to $0.3875 per unit, a decrease of approximately 67% per unit, in connection with the announcement of the EQM Merger, commencing with the first quarter 2020 distribution. See Note 18 for additional information regarding the EQM Merger.\nIf EQM's unitholders remove the EQM General Partner, we would lose our ability to manage EQM and could face substantial repayment obligations under our credit facilities.\nWe currently manage EQM through the EQM General Partner, our wholly-owned subsidiary and the general partner of EQM. EQM's partnership agreement, however, gives unitholders of EQM the right to remove the EQM General Partner upon the affirmative vote of holders of 66 2\u20443% of EQM's outstanding units, including the EQM Series A Preferred Units and Class B units voting together with the EQM common units as a single class. If the EQM General Partner were to be removed as general partner of EQM, we would lose our ability to manage EQM. If we lose our ability to manage EQM, the successor general partner of EQM could change EQM's operations in a manner that could have a material impact on EQM's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and may also reduce distributions to EQM's unitholders, all of which could have a material impact on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. A reduction in EQM's distributions will adversely affect the amount of cash distributions we receive and our ability to declare dividends to our shareholders.\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline or fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our or EQM's operating results;\n\u2022\ndeclines, or flat or slow growth, in the production of natural gas by EQT and other customers in EQM's areas of operation;\n\u2022\ndeclining operating revenues derived from EQM's core business;\n\u2022\nany further delays to the MVP in-service date or further MVP cost increases;\n\u2022\ndelays in MVP Southgate in-service date or MVP Southgate cost increases;\n\u2022\nthe gain or loss of significant customers;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory and legal environment under which we operate;\n\u2022\nincreasing growth in the production of associated natural gas in other formations such as the Permian Basin and the supply of such gas to EQM\u2019s end-use markets;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the oil-and-gas industry and domestic and worldwide economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nthe effect of commodity prices on our or EQM\u2019s business;\n\u2022\nchanges in recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nnews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the energy, gas and water industries;\n\u2022\nnew technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding us, our competitors, our customers and our industry;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure to identify or integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions, business combinations, strategic partnerships or joint ventures;\n\u2022\nchanges in our, EQM's or our customers\u2019 (including EQT's) respective credit ratings and access to capital;\n\u2022\ndefaults, if any, of EQM's customers, including EQT;\n\u2022\nadditional investments from third parties;\n\u2022\ndividend and distribution amounts and timing and rates; and\n\u2022\nissuance of additional shares of our common stock.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\nOur stock price may be adversely affected by dispositions or anticipated dispositions of our common stock by significant shareholders, including EQT.\nFollowing the Distribution, EQT retained 19.9% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. In October 2019, EQT publicly disclosed that it plans to dispose of all of our common stock that it retained after the Distribution by mid-2020, which may include dispositions through one or more subsequent exchanges for debt or a sale of such shares for cash as soon as practical following the Distribution consistent with the business reasons for the retention of those shares, but in no event later than five years after the Distribution. Any disposition by EQT, or any other significant shareholder, of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such dispositions could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nSee Share Purchase Agreements in Note 18.\nOur ability to meet our financial needs may be adversely affected by our lack of operational assets.\nOur only cash-generating assets are partnership interests in EQM, and we currently have no independent operations separate from those of EQM. A reduction in EQM's distributions will affect the amount of cash distributions we receive and the amount of cash we will be able to distribute to our shareholders. Given that our only cash-generating assets are partnership interests in EQM, we may not have enough cash to meet our needs if any of the following events occur:\n\u2022\nan increase in our operating expenses;\n\u2022\nan increase in our general and administrative expenses;\n\u2022\nan increase in our working capital requirements; or\n\u2022\nan increase in the cash needs of EQM or its subsidiaries that reduces EQM's distributions, including as a result of an increase in EQM's and its subsidiaries\u2019 debt service requirements, distributions to the holders of EQM Series A Preferred Units and/or other liabilities.\nOn February 27, 2020, EQM announced its intention to reduce its quarterly distribution from $1.16 per unit to $0.3875 per unit, a decrease of approximately 67% per unit, in connection with the announcement of the EQM Merger, commencing with the first quarter 2020 distribution. On February 27, 2020, the Company also announced its intention to reduce its quarterly dividend from $0.45 per share to $0.15 per share, a decrease of approximately 67% per share, in connection with the announcement of the EQM Merger, commencing with the first quarter 2020 dividend.\nOur indebtedness, and restrictions under the agreements governing our indebtedness, could adversely affect our operating flexibility, business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nOur level of debt could have important consequences to us, including the following:\n\u2022\nOur ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired, or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;\n\u2022\nOur funds available for operations, future business opportunities and dividends to shareholders will be reduced by that portion of our cash flow required to service our debt;\n\u2022\nWe may be more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and\n\u2022\nOur flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions may be limited.\nOur ability to service our debt will depend principally on receiving distributions from EQM which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our or EQM's control. See \"- Risks Related to EQM's Business.\"\nSee Note 18 for a description of the \"Intercompany Loan\".\nWe cannot guarantee the timing, amount or payment of dividends on our common stock.\nAlthough we expect to pay regular cash dividends, the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to shareholders will fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors (the Board). The Board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, the in-service dates of significant EQM growth projects, any debt service obligations and covenants associated with such debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the Board deems relevant.\nBecause our only source of operating cash flow consists of cash distributions from EQM, the amount of dividends we are able to pay to our shareholders may fluctuate based on the level of distributions EQM makes to its partners, including us. We cannot assure you that EQM will continue to make quarterly cash distributions at its most recently announced fourth quarter 2019 distribution amount of $1.16 per unit or any other amount. In addition, while we may expect to increase or decrease dividends to our shareholders if EQM were to increase or decrease distributions to unitholders, the timing and amount of such changes in dividends, if any, would not necessarily be comparable to the timing and amount of any changes in distributions made by EQM to us. Various factors, such as reserves established by the Board of Directors of the EQM General Partner, may affect the distributions EQM makes to its unitholders, including us. In addition, prior to making any distributions to its unitholders, EQM will reimburse the EQM General Partner and its affiliates for all direct and indirect expenses incurred by us and certain of our affiliates on its behalf. The EQM General Partner will determine the amount of these reimbursed expenses. The reimbursement of these expenses could adversely affect the amount of distributions EQM makes to its unitholders, including us.\nOn February 27, 2020, EQM announced its intention to reduce its quarterly distribution from $1.16 per unit to $0.3875 per unit, a decrease of approximately 67% per unit, in connection with the announcement of the EQM Merger, commencing with the first quarter 2020 distribution. On February 27, 2020, the Company also announced its intention to reduce its quarterly dividend from $0.45 per share to $0.15 per share, a decrease of approximately 67% per share, in connection with the announcement of the EQM Merger, commencing with the first quarter 2020 dividend.\nYour percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in us may be diluted because of equity awards that we grant to our directors, officers and employees or otherwise as a result of equity issuances for acquisitions or capital market transactions. Our Management\nDevelopment and Compensation Committee and the Company's Board of Directors have authority to grant share-based awards to our employees under our employee benefit plans. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. From time to time, we will issue share-based awards to our employees under our employee benefits plans.\nIn addition, our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock that have such designations, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nFor a discussion of dilution as a result of the EQM Merger, see \"Risks Related to the Merger of the Company and EQM.\"\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws, as well as provisions of Pennsylvania law, could impair an attempt to acquire us.\nOur Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of us deemed undesirable by our Board. These include provisions:\n\u2022\nrequiring the vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock for the approval of certain transactions;\n\u2022\nrequiring the vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock to amend our articles of incorporation and bylaws, under certain circumstances;\n\u2022\nauthorizing blank check preferred stock, which we could issue with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to those of our common stock;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\nspecifying that our shareholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of shareholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and prohibiting our shareholders from calling special meetings;\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice of proposals by our shareholders for business to be conducted at shareholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board; and\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for conduct of our Board and shareholder meetings and election, appointment and removal of our directors.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests and changes in control or management of us. As a Pennsylvania corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Pennsylvania law, including certain provisions of Chapter 25 of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (PBCL), which prevents some shareholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.\nAny provision of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or Second Amended and Restated Bylaws or Pennsylvania law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of us could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Bylaws designate the state and federal courts sitting in the judicial district of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, County of Allegheny, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that, unless our Board otherwise determines, the state and federal courts sitting in the judicial district of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, County of Allegheny, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or other employee of ours to us or our shareholders, any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of us arising pursuant to any provision of the PBCL or our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or Second Amended and Restated Bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of ours governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision set forth in our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws does not apply to actions arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.\nWhen applicable, this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Pennsylvania were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic, operational and financial plans.\nOur operations are dependent upon key management and technical personnel, and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us. In addition, the success of our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to identify, attract, develop and retain experienced personnel. There is competition within our industry for experienced technical personnel and certain other professionals, which could increase the costs associated with identifying, attracting and retaining such personnel. If we cannot identify, attract, develop and retain technical and professional personnel and our ability to compete could be harmed.\nWe may experience difficulties with implementation and operation of our new enterprise resource planning software solution.\nWe are in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. We are committing significant resources to implementation activities and the system software. Our ERP system is critical to our financial reporting and ability to establish effective controls and execute critical business processes. The transition to our new ERP system may be disruptive to our business if the ERP system, which is to be done in phases, does not work as planned or if we experience issues relating to the implementation. Such disruptions could impact our ability to provide important information to our management, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations, accurately maintain books and records, provide accurate, timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results or otherwise operate our business. In addition, we may experience periodic or prolonged disruption of our financial functions arising out of the implementation and conversion, general use of the system, other periodic upgrades or updates, or other external factors that are outside of our control. Additionally, if the system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or ability to assess it adequately could be delayed. This ERP system and our other information technology systems may be vulnerable to data breaches, cyber-attacks or fraud.\nThe EQM General Partner owes duties to EQM's unitholders that may conflict with our interests, including in connection with the terms of contractual agreements, the determination of cash distributions to be made by EQM, and the determination of whether EQM should make acquisitions and on what terms, and the duties of our officers and directors may conflict with their duties as officers and/or directors of the EQM General Partner.\nConflicts of interest exist and may arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, including the EQM General Partner, on the one hand, and EQM, on the other hand. For example, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with the following:\n\u2022\nthe terms and conditions of any contractual agreements between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and EQM, on the other hand;\n\u2022\nthe determination of the amount of cash to be distributed to EQM's partners, including us, and the amount of cash to be reserved for the future conduct of EQM's business;\n\u2022\nthe determination of whether EQM should make acquisitions and on what terms;\n\u2022\nthe determination of whether EQM should use cash on hand, borrow or issue equity to raise cash to finance acquisitions, other strategic transactions or expansion capital projects, repay indebtedness, meet working capital needs, pay distributions or otherwise;\n\u2022\nany decision we make in the future to engage in business activities independent of EQM; and\n\u2022\nthe allocation of shared overhead expenses between EQM and us.\nSee Note 18 for a description of the EQM Merger and the Share Purchases.\nThe directors and officers of the EQM General Partner have duties to manage EQM in a manner that is beneficial to us as the EQM General Partner's indirect owner. At the same time, the EQM General Partner, as the general partner of EQM, has a duty to manage EQM in a manner beneficial to EQM and its limited partners.\nAdditionally, our officers and directors have duties to manage our business in a manner beneficial to us and our shareholders. However, two of our directors are also directors of the EQM General Partner, and four of our executive officers are also executive officers and/or directors of the EQM General Partner, each of whom has duties to manage the businesses of EQM in a manner beneficial to EQM, and its unitholders. Consequently, these directors and officers may encounter situations in which their obligations to EQM and/or the EQM General Partner, as applicable, on the one hand, and us, on the other hand, are in conflict.\nThe Board of Directors of the EQM General Partner or its conflicts committee may resolve conflicts and has broad latitude to consider the interests of all parties to the conflict. The resolution of conflicts may not always be in our best interest or that of our shareholders.\nOur ability to sell our partnership interests in EQM may be limited by securities law restrictions and liquidity constraints.\nWe beneficially own 117,245,455 EQM common units and 7,000,000 EQM Class B units, all of which are unregistered and restricted securities, within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Unless we exercise our registration rights with respect to our EQM common units, we will be limited in our ability to sell our EQM common units, and we are limited in our ability to sell our EQM Class B units, in the public market.\nFollowing completion of the EQM Merger, EQM's common units will no longer be publicly traded.\nRisks Related to the Separation\nWe have only operated as an independent company since November 12, 2018, and our historical and pro forma financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved or will achieve as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nThe historical and pro forma financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for periods prior to November 12, 2018, refers to our business as operated by and integrated with EQT and was derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of EQT. Accordingly, the historical and pro forma financial information for dates prior to November 12, 2018 do not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented, or those that we will achieve in the future, primarily as a result of the factors described below:\n\u2022\nPrior to the Separation, our business was operated by EQT as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. EQT and certain of its affiliates performed certain corporate functions for us. Our historical and pro forma financial results prior to the Separation reflect allocations of corporate expenses from EQT for such functions that are less than similar expenses we incur as a separate publicly traded company.\n\u2022\nLeading up to and continuing since the Separation, certain key employees in the corporate services functions have faced sustained periods of unusually high utilization in an effort to pursue and implement our operating priorities and strategies as an independent public company. If we are unable to attract, develop and retain qualified employees to support the various functions of our business, including by providing effective development\nopportunities and other forms of rewards and recognition, such periods of high utilization may have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition and may lead to increased potential for error or an inability to timely complete tasks, which may in turn negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act) and are required to prepare our financial statements according to the rules and regulations required by the SEC. Complying with these requirements has resulted in significant costs to us and required and will require us to divert substantial resources, including management time, from other activities.\nOther significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of operating as a company separate from EQT. For additional information about the past financial performance of our business, see \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data\" and \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" as well as the financial statements and accompanying notes included in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nIf the Separation and Distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not continue to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, EQT, and our respective shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify EQT for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.\nIt was a condition to the Distribution that (i) a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding the qualification of the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code and certain other U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the Separation and Distribution shall not have been revoked or modified in any material respect and (ii) EQT received an opinion of counsel with respect to certain tax matters relating to the qualification of the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction described in Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. The IRS private letter ruling is based upon and relies on, and the opinion of counsel is based upon and relies on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of EQT and us, including those relating to the past and future conduct of EQT and us. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings is, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, or if any representations or covenants contained in any of the Separation-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to any IRS private letter ruling or opinion of counsel are breached, such IRS private letter ruling and/or opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.\nNotwithstanding receipt of the IRS private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the Distribution and/or certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which such IRS private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated. In addition, the IRS private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, continues to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the opinion of counsel represented the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the IRS or any court and the IRS or a court may disagree with the conclusions in any opinion of counsel. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt of an IRS private letter ruling or opinion of counsel, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert that the Distribution and/or certain related transactions do not qualify for the intended tax treatment or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the event the IRS were to prevail with such challenge we, EQT, and our respective shareholders could be subject to material U.S. federal income tax liability.\nEven if the Distribution otherwise qualifies as generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 355 and Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, it would result in a material U.S. federal income tax liability to EQT (but not to its shareholders) under Section 355(e) of the Code if one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50-percent or greater interest (measured by either vote or value) in EQT's stock or in the stock of us as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Distribution, and we may be required to indemnify EQT for any such liability under the tax matters agreement entered into by EQT and us in connection with the Distribution. Any acquisition of EQT's stock or our stock (or any predecessor or successor corporation) within two years before or after the Distribution generally would be presumed to be part of a plan that includes the Distribution, although such presumptions may be rebutted under certain circumstances. The process for determining whether an acquisition is part of a plan under these rules is complex, inherently factual in nature and subject to a comprehensive analysis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Notwithstanding the IRS private letter ruling and opinion of counsel described above, a sufficient change in ownership of EQT or our common stock may occur which could result in a material tax liability to EQT.\nUnder the tax matters agreement that EQT entered into with us, we may be required to indemnify EQT against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of our equity securities or assets, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (ii) other actions or failures to act by us or (iii) any of our representations, covenants or undertakings contained in any of the Separation-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated. Any such indemnity obligations could be material. For a more detailed discussion, see \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director Independence\" found in our Proxy Statement.\nIf the IRS were to successfully assert that the EQM Merger or Share Purchases resulted in the Distribution and/or certain related transactions being treated as taxable transactions to EQT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may be required to indemnify EQT for such taxes and related amounts.\nWe may determine to forgo or be required to forgo certain transactions in order to avoid the risk of incurring material tax-related liabilities or indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.\nAs a result of requirements of Section 355 of the Code and/or other applicable tax laws, we may determine to forgo certain transactions that would otherwise be advantageous. In particular, we may determine to continue to operate certain business operations for the foreseeable future even if a sale or discontinuance of such business would otherwise be advantageous. Moreover, in light of the requirements of Section 355(e) of the Code, we may determine to forgo certain transactions, including share repurchases, stock issuances, certain asset dispositions and other strategic transactions, for some period of time following the Distribution. To preserve the tax-free treatment of the Separation and the Distribution, and in addition to our indemnity obligations described above, the tax matters agreement restricts us, for the two-year period following the Distribution, except in specific circumstances, from: (i) entering into any transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of our stock would be acquired, whether by merger or otherwise, (ii) issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds, (iii) repurchasing shares of our stock other than in certain open-market transactions, (iv) ceasing to actively conduct certain of our businesses, including, for example, ceasing to hold at least a 35% interest in each of the profit, loss and capital in EQM, or (v) taking or failing to take any other action that prevents the Distribution and certain related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code unless, in each case, before taking any such action, (a) EQT has obtained a private letter ruling (or, if applicable, a supplemental private letter ruling) in form and substance satisfactory to EQT in the exercise of its reasonable discretion from the IRS and/or any other applicable tax authority to the effect that such transaction will not affect the tax-free status of the Distribution and certain related transactions, (b) we have provided EQT with an unqualified tax opinion in form and substance satisfactory to EQT in the exercise of its reasonable discretion to the effect that the transaction will not affect the tax-free status of the Distribution and certain related transactions, or (c) EQT has waived (which waiver may be withheld by EQT in its sole and absolute discretion) the requirement to obtain such a ruling or unqualified tax opinion. These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain equity issuances, strategic transactions or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business. For more information, see \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director Independence\" found in our Proxy Statement.\nThe completion of each of the EQM Merger and Share Purchases are conditioned upon, among other things, our delivery to EQT of an unqualified tax opinion (that is in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to EQT) to the effect that the EQM Merger or Share Purchases, as applicable, will not affect the tax-free status of the Distribution and certain related transactions. If we were unable to deliver such a tax opinion we might not be able to consummate the EQM Merger or Share Purchases.\nCertain contingent liabilities allocated to us following the Separation may mature, resulting in material adverse impacts to our business.\nThere are several significant areas where the liabilities of EQT may become our obligations. For example, under the Code and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the EQT consolidated U.S. federal income tax return group during a taxable period or portion of a taxable period ending on or before the effective date of the Distribution is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the EQT consolidated U.S. federal income tax return group for that taxable period. Consequently, if EQT is unable to pay the consolidated U.S. federal income tax liability for a pre-Separation period, we could be required to pay the amount of such tax, which could be substantial and in excess of the amount allocated to us under the tax matters agreement. For a discussion of the tax matters agreement, see \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director Independence\" found in our Proxy Statement. Other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans, as well as other contingent liabilities.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Separation, and failure to realize such benefits may materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The Separation and Distribution were expected to provide the following benefits, among others:\n\u2022\nallow us to more effectively pursue and implement our own distinct operating priorities and strategies and improve board of director and management fit and focus, enabling us to pursue unique opportunities for long-term growth and profitability;\n\u2022\nallow our equity to be used as a focused acquisition currency, and as such, provide us with greater opportunities to pursue strategic investments and merger and acquisition opportunities;\n\u2022\nafford us direct access to capital markets, facilitating our ability to pursue our specific growth objectives;\n\u2022\nallow us the flexibility to develop a growth strategy that capitalizes on our distinct strengths and consequently enable us to be well-positioned to capitalize on the available opportunity set in our specific market;\n\u2022\npermit us to concentrate our financial resources solely on our own operations, providing us with greater flexibility to invest capital in our business at a time and in a manner appropriate for our distinct strategy and business needs;\n\u2022\nfacilitate a more efficient allocation of capital based on our profitability, cash flow and growth opportunities and allow us to pursue an optimal mix of return of capital to shareholders, reinvestment in technology and value-enhancing investments and merger and acquisition and joint venture opportunities;\n\u2022\nfacilitate our access to equity capital markets by making us eligible for inclusion in certain stock indices and to debt capital markets by allowing ratings agencies to evaluate our creditworthiness on a standalone basis;\n\u2022\nfacilitate deeper understanding by investors of our business, allowing investors to more transparently value our merits, strategy, performance and future prospects, further facilitating our access to capital markets;\n\u2022\nfacilitate EQM's ability to contract with customers and suppliers, especially those that prefer to enter into certain commercial arrangements with pure-play midstream business rather than integrated midstream and upstream companies, thereby allowing EQM to expand and diversify its customer and supplier bases; and\n\u2022\nfacilitate incentive compensation arrangements for employees that are more directly tied to the performance of our businesses. An improved equity currency will enhance employee hiring and retention by, among other things, improving the alignment of management and employee incentives with performance and growth objectives.\nWe may not achieve these or other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including, among others: (i) as an independent company, following the Separation, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if we were still a part of EQT, and (ii) following the Separation, our business is now less diversified than EQT's business prior to the Separation. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the Separation, or if such benefits are delayed, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe or EQT may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the Separation.\nIn connection with the Separation, we and EQT entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement as well as various other agreements, including a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement and a shareholder and registration rights agreement with respect to EQT's continuing ownership of our common stock. The Separation and Distribution Agreement, the tax matters agreement and the employee matters agreement determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the Separation for those respective areas and include indemnification related to liabilities and obligations. If EQT is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. For a description of these agreements with EQT, see \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director Independence\" found in our Proxy Statement.\nCertain members of our management and directors hold stock in both EQT and us, and as a result may face actual or potential conflicts of interest.\nAlthough none of our management or directors serve at both EQT and the Company, certain of our management and directors may own both shares of common stock in EQT (EQT common stock) and our common stock. This ownership overlap could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our management and directors and EQT management and directors face decisions that could have different implications for us and EQT. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between us and EQT regarding the terms of the agreements governing the Distribution and our relationship with EQT following the Distribution. These agreements include the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the tax matters agreement, the employee matters agreement, and any other agreements between the parties or their respective affiliates. Potential conflicts of interest may also arise out of any commercial arrangements between us or EQM, on the one hand, and EQT, on the other hand. For more information, see \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director Independence\" found in our Proxy Statement.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could materially and adversely affect us.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act and are required to prepare our financial statements according to the rules and regulations required by the SEC. In addition, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports. Our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner or to otherwise comply with applicable law could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws, expose us to lawsuits and restrict our ability to access financing.\nIn addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that, among other things, we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and disclosure purposes. To comply with this statute, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures, our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent auditors are required to issue an opinion on their audit of our internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is complex and may be revised over time to adapt to changes in our business or changes in applicable accounting rules. We cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in the future or that a material weakness will not be discovered with respect to a prior period. If we are not able to maintain or document effective internal control over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, as noted under \"Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting,\" management's assessment of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the entities acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition on April 10, 2019.\nMatters affecting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis, or may cause us to restate previously issued financial information, and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions or investigations by the SEC, or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements is also likely to suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm reports a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. This could have a material and adverse effect on us by, for example, leading to a decline in our share price or impairing our ability to raise additional capital.\nEQT may retain a significant ownership stake in us.\nWe expect that EQT will ultimately dispose of its ownership interest in us, representing approximately 19.9% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2019, as soon as practicable consistent with the business reasons for the retention of such common stock, but in no event later than five years after the Distribution. On October 31, 2019, EQT management stated on its 2019 third quarter earnings call that it plans to dispose of all of our common stock that it retained after the Distribution by mid-2020. There can be no assurance regarding the method by which EQT will dispose of its interest in us, as we expect EQT to seek to maximize overall value to its shareholders, or the actual timing of any such disposal. Alternatives include one or more subsequent exchanges of such common stock for debt and a sale of such common stock for cash. See Note 18 for a description of the Share Purchases.\nEQT may decide for any reason not to consummate the disposition and instead retain a significant ownership interest in us for a period of time (not exceeding five years). Any delay by EQT in completing the disposition could have a material adverse effect on the market price for our common stock, which could affect investor confidence in us.\nPotential indemnification liabilities to EQT pursuant to agreements relating to the Separation and Distribution could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe Separation and Distribution Agreement with EQT provides for, among other things, provisions governing the relationship between us and EQT with respect to and resulting from the Separation. For a description of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, see \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director Independence\" found in our Proxy Statement. Among other things, the Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the Separation, as well as those obligations of EQT assumed by us pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement. If we are required to indemnify EQT under the circumstances set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities.\nIn addition, under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with EQT, we may be required to indemnify EQT against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of our equity securities or assets, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (ii) other actions or failures to act by us or (iii) any of our representations, covenants or undertakings contained in any of the Separation-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated. Any such indemnity obligations could be material. For more information, see \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director Independence\" found in our Proxy Statement.\nIf the IRS were to successfully assert that the EQM Merger and Share Purchases resulted in the Distribution and/or certain related transactions being treated as taxable transactions to EQT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may be required to indemnify EQT for such taxes and related amounts.\nRisks Related to the Merger of the Company and EQM\nThe number of shares of Equitrans Midstream common stock that the holders of EQM common units may receive in the pending merger between the Company and EQM (the EQM Merger) is based on a fixed exchange ratio and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in the price of either shares of the Equitrans Midstream common stock or EQM common units.\nThe market value of the merger consideration that EQM unitholders will receive in the EQM Merger will depend on the trading price of Equitrans Midstream common stock. The exchange ratio set forth in the EQM Merger Agreement that specifies the number of shares of Equitrans Midstream common stock that EQM unitholders will receive as consideration in the EQM Merger is fixed at 2.44 (the Merger Consideration). This means that there is no mechanism contained in the EQM Merger Agreement that would adjust the number of shares of Equitrans Midstream common stock that EQM unitholders will receive as the Merger Consideration based on any decreases or increases in the trading price of Equitrans Midstream common stock. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors (many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s or EQM\u2019s control), including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the Company's, EQM's and EQT's business, operations and prospects or market assessments thereof;\n\u2022\ninterest rates, general market, industry and economic conditions and other factors generally affecting the price of Equitrans Midstream common stock; and\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local legislation, governmental regulation and legal developments in the businesses and industry in which the Company and EQM operate.\nBecause the EQM Merger will be completed after the special meeting of holders of Equitrans Midstream common stock, at the time of the meeting, EQM unitholders will not know the exact market value of Equitrans Midstream common stock that they will receive upon completion of the EQM Merger. If the price of Equitrans Midstream common stock at the closing of the EQM Merger is less than the price of Equitrans Midstream common stock on the date on which the EQM Merger Agreement was signed, then the market value of the Merger Consideration received by EQM unitholders will be less than contemplated at the time the EQM Merger Agreement was signed.\nThe EQM Merger is subject to conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied or completed on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to complete the EQM Merger could have a material and adverse effect on us and, even if completed, the EQM Merger may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits.\nOn February 27, 2020, we and EQM announced that we entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 26, 2020, by and among the Company, EQM LP Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (EQM LP), LS Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of EQM LP, EQM and EQGP Services, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the general partner of EQM (the EQM Merger Agreement). Completion of the EQM Merger is subject to a number of conditions set forth in the EQM Merger Agreement, including: (i) approval of the EQM Merger Agreement by a majority of the holders of EQM common units, Class B unitholders and Series A Preferred Units, with such Series A Preferred units treated as common units on an as-converted basis, voting together as a single class; (ii) approval of the issuance of shares of Equitrans Midstream common stock (the Equitrans Midstream Stock Issuance) by a majority of votes cast at a special meeting of holders of Equitrans Midstream common stock; (iii) there being no law or injunction prohibiting consummation of the transactions contemplated under the EQM Merger Agreement; (iv) the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the Equitrans Midstream Stock Issuance pursuant to the EQM Merger Agreement; (v) approval for listing on the New York Stock Exchange of Equitrans Midstream common stock issuable pursuant to the EQM Merger Agreement; (vi) subject to specified materiality standards, the accuracy of certain representations and warranties of each party; (vii) the delivery of a tax opinion to the Company; (viii) compliance by the respective parties in all material respects with their respective covenants; and (ix) closing the Restructuring (defined in Note 18). These and other conditions to the closing of the EQM Merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the EQM Merger may be delayed or may not be completed.\nIf the EQM Merger is not completed, the Company\u2019s ongoing businesses or the price of Equitrans Midstream common stock may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the EQM Merger, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe will be required to pay our costs relating to the EQM Merger, such as legal, accounting and financial advisory expenses, whether or not the EQM Merger is completed;\n\u2022\ntime and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the EQM Merger could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of Equitrans Midstream common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the EQM Merger will be completed.\nIn addition, even if completed there can be no assurance that the EQM Merger will deliver the benefits anticipated by us.\nFinancial projections relating to the combined company after the EQM Merger may not be achieved.\nIn connection with the EQM Merger, the Company prepared and considered, among other things, internal financial forecasts and analyses for the Company and EQM, which were prepared by employees of the Company. These financial projections include assumptions regarding future operating cash flows, expenditures, and income of the Company and EQM. These financial projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure, are subject to significant economic, competitive, industry, regulatory and other uncertainties and may not be achieved in full, at all, or within projected timeframes. The failure of the Company\u2019s or EQM\u2019s businesses to achieve projected results, including projected cash flows, could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of Equitrans Midstream common stock, the Company's financial position, and the Company\u2019s ability to maintain or increase its dividends following the EQM Merger, if at all.\nThe Company and EQM may be targets of securities class action and derivative lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the completion of the EQM Merger.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into merger agreements, in an effort to enjoin the relevant merger or seek monetary relief. If the Company or EQM are subject to such lawsuits related to the EQM Merger Agreement or the EQM Merger, even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. The Company and EQM cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits, or others, nor can either company predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve such litigation. An unfavorable resolution of any such litigation surrounding the EQM Merger could delay or prevent its consummation. In addition, the costs of defending the litigation, even if resolved in the Company\u2019s or EQM\u2019s favor, could be substantial and such litigation could distract the Company and EQM from pursuing the consummation of the EQM Merger and other potentially beneficial business opportunities.\nThe Company and EQM will incur substantial transaction-related costs in connection with the EQM Merger, including fees paid to legal, financial and accounting advisors, filing fees and printing costs. If the EQM Merger does not occur, the\ncompanies will not benefit from these expenses. In addition, the Company and EQM may not achieve the net benefits from the EQM Merger in the near term.\nThe Company and EQM expect to incur a number of non-recurring transaction-related costs associated with completing the EQM Merger. These fees and costs will be substantial. Non-recurring transaction costs include, but are not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial and accounting advisors, filing fees and printing costs. If the EQM Merger does not occur, neither the Company nor EQM will benefit from these expenses.\nThe EQM Merger may not be accretive to operating earnings and may cause dilution to the Company\u2019s earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of Equitrans Midstream common stock.\nThe Company currently anticipates that the EQM Merger will be initially dilutive to its forecasted earnings per share on a standalone basis. This expectation is based on preliminary estimates, which may materially change. The Company may also have additional transaction- and integration-related costs, may fail to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the EQM Merger or be subject to other factors that affect preliminary estimates or its ability to realize operational efficiencies. Any of these factors could cause a decrease in the Company\u2019s earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected effect of the EQM Merger and contribute to a decrease in the price of Equitrans Midstream common stock.\nApproximately 47.0% of the total voting power of Equitrans Midstream common stock will be issued in connection with the EQM Merger (excluding the $600 million of ETRN Preferred Shares). As a result, the Company\u2019s current shareholders may experience significant dilution as a result of the EQM Merger.\nIf the EQM Merger is successfully completed, the Company expects that it will issue approximately 203 million shares of Equitrans Midstream common stock at the Effective Time in connection with the EQM Merger. In connection with the EQM Merger, the Company will also issue newly-created ETRN Preferred Shares that will be convertible into Equitrans Midstream common stock. In addition, in the future the Company may issue common stock to raise cash for its projects, operations, acquisitions or other purposes and may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and Equitrans Midstream common stock or just Equitrans Midstream common stock.\nAny of these events may dilute the ownership interests of the current holders of Equitrans Midstream common stock, reduce the Company\u2019s earnings per share and have an adverse effect on the price of Equitrans Midstream common stock. The issuance of these new shares and the sale of additional shares from time to time could have the effect of depressing the market value for Equitrans Midstream common stock. The increase in the number of shares of Equitrans Midstream common stock outstanding, and any resulting dilution, may cause holders to sell shares of Equitrans Midstream common stock or may create the perception that such sales may occur, either of which may adversely affect the market for, and the market value of, the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company may further reduce the amount of the cash dividend that it pays on Equitrans Midstream common stock or may not pay any cash dividends at all to its shareholders. The Company\u2019s ability to declare and pay cash dividends to its shareholders, if any, in the future will depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nThe Company is not required to declare dividends of its available cash to its common shareholders. The Board may further reduce its current dividend policy or may decide not to declare any dividends in the future. Any payment of future dividends will be at the sole discretion of the Board and will depend upon many factors, including the financial condition, earnings, liquidity and capital requirements of the Company\u2019s operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.\nAs part of the EQM Merger, the Company has agreed to create and issue ETRN Preferred Shares in exchange for EQM\u2019s outstanding Series A Preferred Units.\nIn April 2019, EQM sold an aggregate of 24,605,291 Series A Preferred Units to certain investors (collectively, the Investors) in the Private Placement for a cash purchase price of $48.77 per Series A Preferred Unit (the Series A Preferred Unit Purchase Price).\nUnder EQM\u2019s Partnership Agreement, the Investors are entitled to make certain elections in respect of a change of control of EQM. In lieu of making an election, and in satisfaction of the Investors\u2019 rights under EQM\u2019s Partnership Agreement upon a change of control of EQM, the holders of the Series A Preferred Units and the Company have agreed that at the Effective Time, the Company will create and issue new ETRN Preferred Shares to the current holders of the EQM Series A Preferred Units and\nEQM will redeem each Investor\u2019s pro rata portion of the $600 million aggregate amount of outstanding Series A Preferred Units.\nAt the time of issuance, the ETRN Preferred Shares will have the following rights and preferences:\n\u2022\nThe ETRN Preferred Shares are a new class of security that will rank pari passu with any other outstanding class or series of preferred stock of the Company and senior to all shares of Equitrans Midstream common stock with respect to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation.\n\u2022\nThe ETRN Preferred Shares will vote on an as-converted basis with Equitrans Midstream common stock and will have certain other class voting rights with respect to any amendment to the Certificate of Designations or the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation that would be adverse (other than in a de minimis manner) to any of the rights, preferences or privileges of the ETRN Preferred Shares.\n\u2022\nThe holders of the ETRN Preferred Shares will receive cumulative quarterly dividends at a rate per annum of 9.75% for each quarter ending on or before March 31, 2024, and thereafter the quarterly dividends at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) three-month LIBOR as of a LIBOR Determination Date (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) in respect of the applicable quarter and (ii) 8.15%; provided that the rate per annum shall not be less than 10.50%.\n\u2022\nThe Company will not be entitled to pay any dividends on any junior securities, including any of Equitrans Midstream common stock, prior to paying the quarterly dividends payable to the ETRN Preferred Shares, including any previously accrued and unpaid dividends.\n\u2022\nEach holder of the ETRN Preferred Shares may elect to convert all or any portion of the ETRN Preferred Shares owned by it into Equitrans Midstream common stock initially on a one-for-one basis, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments and an adjustment for any dividends that have accrued but not been paid when due and partial period dividends (referred to as the \u201cconversion rate\u201d), at any time (but not more often than once per fiscal quarter) after April 10, 2021 (or earlier liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company), provided that any conversion is for at least $20 million (calculated based on the closing price of the ETRN Preferred Shares on the trading day preceding notice of the conversion) or such lesser amount if such conversion relates to all of a holder\u2019s remaining ETRN Preferred Shares.\n\u2022\nThe Company may elect to convert all or any portion of the ETRN Preferred Shares for Equitrans Midstream common stock at any time (but not more often than once per quarter) after April 10, 2021 if (i) the Equitrans Midstream common stock is listed for, or admitted to, trading on a national securities exchange, (ii) the closing price per share of Equitrans Midstream common stock on the national securities exchange on which such shares are listed for, or admitted to, trading exceeds 140% of the price at which the ETRN Preferred Shares were issued (the ETRN Preferred Shares Issue Price) for the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding notice of the conversion, (iii) the average daily trading volume of the Equitrans Midstream common stock on the national securities exchange on which the Equitrans Midstream common stock is listed for, or admitted to, trading exceeds 1,000,000 shares of Equitrans Midstream common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding notice of the conversion, (iv) the Company has an effective registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering resales of the Equitrans Midstream common stock to be received by such holders upon any such conversion and (v) the Company has paid all accrued quarterly dividends in cash to the holders.\n\u2022\nUpon certain events involving a Change of Control (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) in which more than 90% of the consideration payable to the holders of the Company's common stock is payable in cash, the ETRN Preferred Shares will automatically convert into Equitrans Midstream common stock at a conversion ratio equal to the ETRN Preferred Shares Issue Price multiplied by 110% plus any unpaid dividends on such date and any partial period dividend with respect to the ETRN Preferred Shares for the quarter in which the conversion occurs, divided by (ii) the ETRN Preferred Shares Issue Price.\n\u2022\nIn connection with other Change of Control events that do not satisfy the 90% cash consideration threshold described above, in addition to certain other conditions, each holder of ETRN Preferred Shares may elect to (a) convert all, but not less than all, of its ETRN Preferred Shares into Equitrans Midstream common stock at the then applicable conversion rate, (b) if the Company is not the surviving entity (or if the Company is the surviving entity, but Equitrans Midstream common stock will cease to be listed), require the Company to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the surviving entity in any such transaction to issue a substantially equivalent security (or if the Company is unable to cause such substantially equivalent securities to be issued, to convert into shares of Equitrans Midstream\ncommon stock at a premium of 110% of the ETRN Preferred Shares Issue Price), (c) if the Company is the surviving entity, continue to hold the ETRN Preferred Shares or (d) require the Company to redeem the ETRN Preferred Shares at a price per share equal to 101% of the ETRN Preferred Shares Issue Price, plus accrued and unpaid dividends on the applicable ETRN Preferred Shares and any partial period dividends for the quarter in which the redemption occurs, which redemption price may be payable in cash, Equitrans Midstream common stock or a combination thereof at the election of the Board of Directors (and, if payable in Equitrans Midstream common stock, such Equitrans Midstream common stock will be issued at 95% of the VWAP of Equitrans Midstream common stock for the 20-day period ending on the fifth trading day immediately preceding the consummation of the Change of Control). Any holder of ETRN Preferred Shares that requires the Company to redeem its ETRN Preferred Shares pursuant to clause (d) above will have the right to withdraw such election with respect to all, but not less than all, of its ETRN Preferred Shares at any time prior to the fifth trading day immediately preceding the consummation of the Change of Control and instead elect to be treated in accordance with any of clauses (a), (b) or (c) above.\n\u2022\nAt any time on or after January 1, 2024, the Company will have the right to redeem ETRN Preferred Shares, in whole or in part, by paying cash for each ETRN Preferred Share to be redeemed in an amount equal to the greater of (a) the sum of (i)(1) the ETRN Preferred Shares Issue Price multiplied by (2) 110%, plus (ii) any unpaid dividends on such date and any partial period dividend with respect to the ETRN Preferred Shares for the quarter in which the conversion occurs and (b) the amount the holder of such ETRN Preferred Share would receive if such holder had converted such ETRN Preferred Share into shares of Equitrans Midstream common stock at the applicable conversion ratio and the Company liquidated immediately thereafter.\n\u2022\nPursuant to the terms of the Restructuring Agreement, in connection with the Restructuring Closing, the Company has agreed to enter into the Registration Rights Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, the Company will give the Investors certain rights to require the Company to file and maintain one or more registration statements with respect to the resale of the ETRN Preferred Shares and the shares of Equitrans Midstream common stock that are issuable upon conversion of the ETRN Preferred Shares, and to require the Company to initiate underwritten offerings for the ETRN Preferred Shares and the shares of Equitrans Midstream common stock that are issuable upon conversion of the ETRN Preferred Shares.\nThe creation and issuance of the ETRN Preferred Shares present a number of risks to current and future holders of Equitrans Midstream common stock, including a preference in favor of holders of ETRN Preferred Shares in the payment of dividends on Equitrans Midstream common stock, the risk of dilution occurring as a result of the conversion of the ETRN Preferred Shares into Equitrans Midstream common stock and the ability of the holders of the ETRN Preferred Shares to vote with the holders of Equitrans Midstream common stock on most matters, as well as the risk that the holders of the ETRN Preferred Shares will have certain other class voting rights with respect to any amendment to the Company\u2019s organizational documents that would be adverse (other than in a de minimis manner) to any of the rights, preferences or privileges of the ETRN Preferred Shares.", "PERMNO": 18150, "SIC": 4922, "TIC": "ETRN"}
