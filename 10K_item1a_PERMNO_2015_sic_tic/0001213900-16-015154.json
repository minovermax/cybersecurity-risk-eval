You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks or uncertainties occur, our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing the risks described below, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and schedules, before deciding to purchase any shares of our common stock.\nReferences herein to the pre-Effective Date common stock of SGB shall be deemed references to Former Common Stock and references herein to the post-Effective Date common stock of SGB shall be deemed references to New Common Stock.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Emergence from Bankruptcy\nDespite having emerged from bankruptcy on June 30, 2016, the Company continues to be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with residual Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.\nAs discussed below (see Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Bankruptcy Proceedings), the Company emerged from bankruptcy on June 30, 2016. Because of the residual risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, the ultimate impact that events that occurred during, or that may occur subsequent to, these proceedings will have on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be accurately predicted or quantified. We cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy protection will not adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations going forward.\nOur actual financial results may vary significantly from the projections filed with the Bankruptcy Court.\nIn connection with the Plan, the Company was required to prepare projected financial information to demonstrate to the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of the Plan and the Company\u2019s ability to continue operations upon emergence from bankruptcy under Chapter 11. The projected financial information filed with the Bankruptcy Court reflected numerous assumptions concerning anticipated future performance and prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions, many of which were and continue to be beyond our control and which may not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks. The Company\u2019s actual results will likely vary from those contemplated by the projected financial information and the variations may be material.\nRisks Relating to the Company\nIf we are not successful in our efforts to increase sales or raise capital, we will experience a shortfall in cash over the next twelve months and our ability to raise capital may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, SG Building, our wholly-owned subsidiary, had cash and cash equivalents of $466,997 and $884,188, respectively. However, during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we reported a net loss of $2,743,116 and $1,537,315, respectively. We incurred additional losses during the quarter ended March 31, 2016. If we are not successful with our marketing efforts to increase sales, we will experience a shortfall in cash over the next twelve months. If necessary, we will implement a plan to fund such a deficit which could include, among other things, reducing operating expenses in an amount sufficient to operate the business for a reasonable period of time. During 2013 we received an aggregate of $1,850,000 from the issuance of convertible debentures (the \u201cExisting Debentures\u201d). On April 10, 2014, we entered into an Exchange Agreement (the \u201cExchange Agreement\u201d), with certain of Holders of the Existing Debentures pursuant to which Existing Debentures with a stated maturity value of $1,680,000 were surrendered in exchange for (a) new Senior Convertible Debentures with a stated interest rate of eight percent (8%) per year, a stated maturity value of $1,915,200, a conversion price of $.25 per share, subject to adjustment, with a final maturity date of April 1, 2016 (the \u201c2014 Exchange Debentures\u201d), and (b) five (5) year warrants to purchase up to 7,660,830 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at an exercise price of $.275 per share (110% of the conversion price), subject to adjustment (the \u201c2014 Exchange Warrants\u201d).\nAlso on April 10, 2014, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the \u201c2014 SPA\u201d) pursuant to which we issued and sold (a) $2,080,500 (maturity value) in Senior Convertible Debentures for a subscription amount of $1,825,000, that have the same terms as the 2014 Exchange Debentures, including a stated interest rate of eight percent (8%) per year and a conversion price of $.25 per share, subject to adjustment, with a final maturity date of April 1, 2016 (the \u201c2014 New Debentures\u201d together with the 2014 Exchange Debentures, the \u201c2014 Debentures\u201d) and (b) five (5) year warrants to purchase up to 8,322,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at an exercise price of $.275 per share (110% of the conversion price), subject to adjustment (the \u201c2014 New Warrants\u201d together with the 2014 Exchange Warrants, the \u201c2014 Warrants\u201d).\nOn August 5, 2015, the Company issued and sold to Hillair a $162,000 Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debenture due November 3, 2015 (the \u201cBridge Debenture\u201d), for $150,000 (the \u201cAugust 2015 Financing\u201d). The sale and issuance of the Bridge Debenture was consummated pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated August 5, 2015, between the Company and Hillair. At any time after August 5, 2015, until the Bridge Debenture is no longer outstanding, the Bridge Debenture is convertible, in whole or in part, into shares of Common Stock at the option of Hillair, subject to certain conversion limitations set forth in the Bridge Debenture. The initial conversion price for the Bridge Debenture is $0.10 per share, subject to adjustments upon certain events, as set forth in the Bridge Debenture. As the Bridge Debenture was issued at an original issue discount, interest does not accrue on the Bridge Debenture.\nIn connection with the Bankruptcy Proceedings, SGB, as borrower, and its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into the DIP Facility with HCM. The DIP Loan had a maximum principal amount of $600,000, bore interest at a rate of 12%. On the Effective Date and in accordance with the Plan, the DIP Facility was repaid in full and the related DIP Credit Agreement was terminated. On the Effective Date, and pursuant to the terms of the Plan, SGB entered into Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which SGB sold for a subscription price of $2.0 million a 12% Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debenture to HCI in the principal amount of $2.5 million, with a maturity date of June 30, 2018 (the Exit Facility). The Exit Facility is convertible at HCI\u2019s option at any time in whole or in part into shares of Common Stock at a ratio of 1 share for every $1.25 of debt. See Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Bankruptcy Proceedings.\nAs described in the July 8-K, the Existing Debentures, the 2014 Debentures, the Bridge Debenture and each other Prepetition Loan Document (as defined in the July 8-K), were cancelled and the holders of debt thereunder received one share of the New Preferred Stock for each dollar owed by SGB thereunder. See Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Bankruptcy Proceedings for additional detail regarding the conversion of debentures.\nWe may also seek to obtain debt or additional equity financing to address any shortfalls in our cash. The type, timing and terms of the financing we may select will depend on, among other things, our cash needs, the availability of other financing sources and prevailing conditions in the financial markets. However, there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure additional funds if needed and that if such funds are available, whether the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us. In such case, the further reduction in operating expenses might need to be substantial in order for us to ensure enough liquidity to sustain our operations. It will also be difficult for us to make any acquisitions unless we can raise additional capital. Any financing would be dilutive to our stockholders.\nThe Company has identified cost reduction measures which when implemented would result in a reduction in employee headcount, reduction in base salaries to senior executives and employees, and other cost savings measures. These actions have been implemented and have begun to result in annual cost savings.\nWe have incurred net losses in certain prior periods and there can be no assurance that we will generate income in the future.\nOur ability to achieve profitability will depend upon our ability to generate and sustain substantially increased revenues. We may incur operating losses in the future as we execute our growth strategy. We intend to make significant expenditures related to marketing, expansion of our website, hiring of additional personnel, and development of our technology and infrastructure. Although SG Building generated revenue from operations during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, it has incurred net losses of $2,743,116 and $1,537,315, respectively, during such periods. The likelihood that we will generate net income in the future must be considered in light of the difficulties facing the construction and construction management industries as a whole, economic conditions, the competitive environment in which we operate and the other risks and uncertainties discussed in this Annual Report. Our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties, and it may not achieve sufficient revenues to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon securing additional capital.\nThe Company expects that through the next 10 to 16 months, the capital requirements to fund the Company\u2019s growth and to cover the operating costs of a public company will consume substantially all of the cash flows that it expects to generate from its operations, as well as from the proceeds of intended issuances of debt and equity securities. The Company further believes that during this period, while the Company is focusing on the growth and expansion of its business, the gross profit that it expects to generate from operations will not generate sufficient funds to cover these anticipated operating costs. Accordingly, the Company requires external funding to sustain operations and to follow through on the execution of its business plan. However, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s plans will materialize and/or that the Company will be successful in funding estimated cash shortfalls through additional debt or equity capital and through the cash generated by the Company\u2019s operations. Given these conditions, the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon it being able to secure an adequate amount of debt or equity capital to enable it to meet its cash requirements. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern must be considered in light of the problems, expenses and complications frequently encountered by entrants into established markets, the competitive environment in which the Company operates and the current capital raising environment.\nThe exercise of outstanding options will dilute the percentage ownership of then-existing stockholders.\nAs of July 20, 2016, there are outstanding options to purchase 655,153 shares of common stock. We also have outstanding convertible debt which is initially convertible into approximately 2,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. However, the terms of the convertible debentures provide that under certain circumstances the number of shares issuable upon the conversion of the debentures can be increased based on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock at the time of conversion. Accordingly, if the price of the common stock is significantly below $1.25 per share the number of shares the convertible debt is convertible into could be significantly higher than 2,000,000 shares. The exercise of such options or the conversion into common stock of our convertible debt would dilute the then-existing stockholders' percentage ownership of the Company's stock, and any sales in the public market of common stock underlying such securities could adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common stock. Moreover, the terms upon which the Company would be able to obtain additional equity capital could be adversely affected since the holders of such securities can be expected to exercise or convert them at a time when the Company would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable to the Company than those provided by such securities. See sections entitled \u201cExecutive Compensation - Stock Options\".\nThe conversion of the convertible debt and preferred stock issued when the Company emerged from bankruptcy will dilute the percentage ownership of then-existing stockholders.\nOn the Effective Date, all previously issued and outstanding shares of Former Common Stock were deemed discharged, cancelled and extinguished, and, pursuant to the Plan, SGB issued, in the aggregate, 491,365 shares of New Common Stock to the holders of Former Common Stock, representing 7.5% of SGB\u2019s issued and outstanding New Common Stock, after taking into account full exercise of the Management Options and conversion of the New Preferred Stock but prior to any conversion of the Exit Facility, as of the Effective Date. Under the Plan, upon the Effective Date certain members of SGB\u2019s management were entitled to receive options (the Management Options) to acquire an aggregate of 10%, or approximately 655,153 shares, of New Common Stock, on a fully diluted basis, assuming conversion of all of the New Preferred Stock but not the Exit Facility. The New Preferred Stock is convertible into New Common Stock on a 1:1 basis and, if converted on the Effective Date, would convert into 82.5% of the New Common Stock issued and outstanding on the Effective Date, after taking into account shares of New Common Stock issued to holders of the Former Common Stock and the exercise of the Management Options but prior to any conversion of the Exit Facility. The Exit Facility, in principal amount of $2.5 million, is convertible at HCI\u2019s option at any time in whole or in part into shares of New Common Stock at a ratio of 1 share for every $1.25 of debt. Conversion of the full principal amount of the Exit Facility ($2.5 million) would result in the issuance of an additional 2,000,000 shares of New Common Stock, which will dilute the percentage ownership of then-existing stockholders. The exchange of debt for equity under the Plan and the conversion of the Exit Facility, if effected on the Effective Date, would give HCI a controlling interest of SGB. See Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Bankruptcy Proceedings.\nWe have a history of losses.\nWe have reported an operating loss in each of our fiscal quarters since inception, except the quarter ending September 30, 2014. There is a risk that we will continue to incur operating losses.\nWe are dependent on the services of key personnel, and the unexpected loss of their services may adversely affect its operations.\nOur success depends highly upon the personal efforts and abilities of our senior management team, specifically the efforts of Paul Galvin, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Director, Stevan Armstrong, the Company\u2019s President and Chief Operating Officer and Director, and David Cross, the Company\u2019s Vice President of Business Development. The employment agreements with Messrs. Galvin and Armstrong have expired and the Company is currently negotiating a new agreement with Mr. Galvin and Mr. Armstrong. Although there is a general agreement on the terms of the new agreement, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to enter into a new agreement with Mr. Galvin and Mr. Armstrong on favorable terms. The loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our ability to achieve profitability and generate increased revenue will depend upon our ability to retain, and attract if necessary, experienced management personnel.\nAn investor in our common stock must consider the uncertainties facing early stage companies in highly regulated industries.\nAn investor in our common stock must consider the uncertainties facing early stage companies in highly regulated industries. These uncertainties include:\n\u25cf an evolving business model that makes future success uncertain and an investment in our common stock highly speculative;\n\u25cf the lack of a well-developed brand that may limit our ability to attract customers;\n\u25cf the potential development of a comparable product and lack of barriers to entry by better funded competitors; and\n\u25cf our new corporate organization, regulatory requirements and its anticipated growth could lead to management distractions and higher than expected operating expenses.\nOur business is susceptible to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters.\nOur construction projects are susceptible to, and are significantly affected by, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, droughts, floods and fires. These adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can cause delays and increased costs in the construction of new buildings. If insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses resulting from adverse weather or natural disasters, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. In addition, damage to new buildings caused by adverse weather or a natural disaster can cause our insurance costs to increase.\nOur failure to successfully complete the integration of SG Building or any other businesses acquired in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAny financing required for acquisitions could dilute the interests of our existing holders of our common stock, result in an increase in our indebtedness or both. Acquisitions may entail numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products, including the loss of key employees from acquired businesses;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u25cf adverse effects on existing business relationships with supplies and customers; and\n\u25cf risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience.\nOur failure to successfully complete the integration of SG Building or any other acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate acquisitions on favorable terms.\nWe rely on ConGlobal Industries, Inc. to supply us with containers used in our business and the unexpected termination of our exclusive 10 year Collaboration and Supply contract with ConGlobal to provide these containers would have a negative impact on our business.\nWe rely on ConGlobal to supply us with containers and other resources used in our business and if this relationship were to unexpectedly end, or if the ConGlobal Agreement were to be unexpectedly terminated, such event could have a negative impact on our business while our alternate sources of supply are being implemented.\nWe rely on certain vendors to supply us with materials and products that if we were unable to obtain could adversely affect our business.\nWe have relationships with key materials vendors, and we rely on suppliers for our purchases of products from them. Any inability to obtain materials or services in the volumes required and at competitive prices from our major trading partners, the loss of any major trading partner, or the discontinuation of vendor financing (if any) may seriously harm our business because we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers on a timely basis in sufficient quantities or at all. Other factors, including reduced access to credit by our vendors resulting from economic conditions, may impair our vendors\u2019 ability to provide products in a timely manner or at competitive prices. We also rely on other vendors for critical services such as transportation, supply chain and professional services. Any negative impacts to our business or liquidity could adversely impact our ability to establish or maintain these relationships.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nWe depend on the availability and skill of subcontractors, their willingness to work with us, and their selection of suitable and quality building materials.\nWe rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our building projects, and in many cases, to select and obtain raw materials. Despite our detailed specifications and quality control procedures, in some cases, improper construction processes or defective materials may be used to finish construction of our building projects. We may need to spend money to remediate such problems when they are discovered. Defective products widely used by the construction industry can result in the need to perform extensive repairs to large numbers of buildings. Though subcontracts are written to protect us from substandard performance or materials, pervasive problems could adversely affect our business. The cost to us in complying with its warranty obligations in these cases may be significant if it is unable to recover the cost of repair from subcontractors, materials suppliers and insurers. Further, the timing and quality of our construction depends on the availability and skill of subcontractors. Although we believe that our relationships with our suppliers and subcontractors are good, there can be no assurance that skilled subcontractors will continue to be available at reasonable rates and in the areas in which we conducts our operations. The inability to contract with skilled subcontractors or general contractors at reasonable costs on a timely basis could limit our ability to build and deliver buildings and could erode our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may have difficulty protecting our proprietary technology.\nIntellectual property and proprietary technology are important to the success of our business. We rely primarily on trade secrets to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology. While we intend to make the appropriate filings and protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, there can be no assurance that we will be able to so. In addition, it is difficult to protect against or monitor all possible misappropriations and unauthorized access to our intellectual property and technology. To date, we have ordered prior art on five potential intellectual property claims. Significant challenges in protecting our intellectual property and technology are posed by (a) funding limitations and (b) our rapidly evolving adaptation to new product/market/technology challenges. Dissemination or dilution of the aforementioned intellectual property and technology could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nGrowth of operations may strain resources and if we fail to manage growth successfully, our business could be adversely affected.\nIncreased orders for our product have placed, and may continue to place, a strain on our operational, financial and managerial resources and personnel. Any failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur exposure to foreign currency rate risks and inflation could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks and inflation with respect to our sales, profits, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as a result of possible international operations. As a result, we may suffer losses as a result of foreign currency rate fluctuations.\nOur revenue growth rate depends on our ability to execute our business plan.\nWe may not be able to identify and maintain the necessary relationships within the industries in which we participate. Our ability to execute our business plan also depends on other factors, including the ability to:\n\u25cf negotiate and maintain contracts and agreements with acceptable terms;\n\u25cf implement terms of contracts and agreements according to original specifications;\n\u25cf hire and train qualified personnel and retain key employees;\n\u25cf maintain an affordable labor force;\n\u25cf maintain marketing and development costs at affordable rates;\n\u25cf ensure the availability of project financing; and\n\u25cf effectively compete within domestic and international markets.\nFailure to properly perform any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe face continuous pricing pressure from our customers and our competitors. This will affect our margins and therefore our profitability and cash flow unless we can efficiently manage our manufacturing costs and market our products based on superior quality.\nOur customers often make purchase decisions based on product pricing. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we have, and as a result may be able to withstand the adverse effect of discounted pricing and reduced margins in order to build market share. While one of our strategies is to offer competitive pricing in order to retain and increase market share, and to seek to manage its manufacturing efficiently to sustain acceptable margins, we may not be able to maintain appropriate prices or to manage product manufacturing costs sufficiently to sustain acceptable margins. Similarly, we also seek to compete based on product quality rather than just price, but we may not be successful in these efforts. This could adversely affect our profitability, liquidity and market share.\nThe sale and export of products to a foreign country involves inherent operational risks that may not be adequately covered by insurance.\nWe can give no assurance that we will be adequately insured against all risks or that our insurers will pay a particular claim. The cost of insurance on foreign business may be substantial and could decrease profitability. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates in the future. We may also be subject to claims by our customers involving disputes or situations that are beyond its control. There is also a possibility of fraudulent claims or other illicit activities involving our transactions. Any of these potentialities may give rise to a loss for which we are not insured, or adequately insured.\nOur liability for estimated warranties may be inadequate, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a construction manager, we are subject to construction defect and warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. These claims are common in the construction management industry and can be costly. At this time, the third party providers offer guarantees and warranties in accordance with industry standards that flow through to our clients. Although we maintain reserves for such claims, which to date have been adequate, there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate. A large number of warranty claims exceeding our current warranty expense levels could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe can be adversely affected by failures of persons who act on our behalf to comply with applicable regulations and guidelines.\nAlthough we expect all of our associates (i.e., employees), officers and directors to comply at all times with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, there are instances in which subcontractors or others through whom we do business may engage in practices that do not comply with applicable regulations or guidelines. It is possible that our associates may become aware of these practices but do not take steps to prevent them. If we learn of practices relating to buildings it constructs that do not comply with applicable regulations or guidelines, we will move actively to stop the non-complying practices as soon as possible and we will take disciplinary action with regard to our associates who were aware of the practices, including in some instances terminating their employment. However, regardless of the steps we take, we may be subject to fines or other governmental penalties, and our reputation may be injured.\nThe cyclical and seasonal nature of the construction and construction management industries causes our revenues and operating results to fluctuate, and we expect this cyclicality and seasonality to continue in the future.\nThe construction and construction management industries are highly cyclical and seasonal and is influenced by many international, national and regional economic factors including the availability of consumer and wholesale financing, seasonality of demand, consumer confidence, interest rates, income levels and general economic conditions, including inflation and recessions. As a result of the foregoing factors, our revenues and operating results fluctuate, and we currently expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. Moreover, we have and may continue to experience operating losses during cyclical downturns in the construction and construction management market.\nWe may not be paid all amounts owed to us by our customers.\nIf the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability or unwillingness to pay amounts owed to us, or if our customers are otherwise unable or unwilling to pay us, or if bankruptcy courts require us to refund amounts paid to us, our earnings and financial position could be negatively impacted.\nRisks Relating to the Construction and Construction Management Industries\nThe construction management industry suffers from a lack of third-party financing, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if additional third-party financing for the purchases of our buildings does not become available.\nOur business and earnings depend substantially on our clients\u2019 ability to obtain financing for the development of their construction projects. The availability and cost of such financing is further dependent on the number of financial institutions participating in the industry, the departure of financial institutions from the industry, the financial institutions\u2019 lending practices, the strength of the domestic and international credit markets generally, governmental policies and other conditions, all of which are beyond our control. In light of the current economic climate, some of our projects may not be successful in obtaining additional funds in a timely manner, on favorable terms or at all. The availability of borrowed funds, especially for construction financing, has been greatly reduced, and lenders may require project developers to invest increased amounts of equity in a project in connection with both new loans and the extension of existing loans. Unfavorable changes in the availability and terms of financing in the industry will have a material adverse effect on certain privately financed projects.\nOur results of operations also depend on the ability of our potential privately financed customers to obtain loans for the purchase of new buildings. Over the past few years, lenders have tightened the credit underwriting standards which have reduced lending volumes. If this trend continues, it would negatively impact our sales. Our sales depend in large part on the availability and cost of financing. In addition, where our potential customers must sell their existing buildings or real estate in order to develop the new buildings, increases in mortgage costs and/or lack of availability of mortgages could prevent buyers of potential customers\u2019 existing buildings from obtaining the mortgages they need to complete their purchases, which would result in our potential customers\u2019 inability to make purchases from us. If our potential buyers cannot obtain suitable financing, our sales and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe construction and construction management industries are highly competitive, and competition may increase the adverse effects of industry conditions.\nWe operate in a very competitive environment, which is characterized by competition from numerous local, regional and national builders and others in the real estate development business around the world. We may compete for financing, raw materials and skilled management and labor resources. We also compete with the rental market, as well as with the resale, or \u201cpreviously owned,\u201d building market, which has increased significantly due to the large number of foreclosures due to the current economic downturn. An oversupply of buildings available for sale and the heavy discounting of building prices by some of our competitors could adversely affect demand for our buildings and our results of operations. Increased competition could require us to further increase our selling incentives and/or reduce our prices which could negatively affect our profits.\nGovernment regulations and legal challenges may delay the start or completion of our projects, increase our expenses or limit our building activities, which could have a negative impact on our operations.\nVarious domestic and international rules and regulations concerning building, zoning, sales and similar matters apply to and/or affect the construction and construction management industries. Governmental regulation affects construction activities as well as sales activities, mortgage lending activities and other dealings with consumers. These industries also have experienced an increase in domestic state and local legislation and regulations that limit the availability or use of land. Municipalities may also restrict or place moratoriums on the availability of utilities, such as water and sewer taps. In some areas, municipalities may enact growth control initiatives, which will restrict the number of building permits available in a given year. In addition, we may be required to apply for additional approvals or modify our existing approvals because of changes in local circumstances or applicable law. If governments in locations in which we operate take actions like these, it could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays, increasing our costs or limiting our ability to operate in those areas. Further, we may experience delays and increased expenses as a result of legal challenges to our proposed projects, whether brought by governmental authorities or private parties. Failure to comply with laws or regulations applicable to or affecting us, or the passage in the future of new and more stringent laws affecting us, may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nSupply risks and shortages relating to labor and materials can harm our business by delaying construction and increasing costs.\nThough the availability of talented consultants and subcontractors is high in the current economic environment, the construction and construction management industries from time to time have experienced significant difficulties with respect to:\n\u25cf shortages of materials;\n\u25cf volatile or sustained increases in the cost of raw materials, including containers, traditional finish materials which are significant components of its construction costs;\n\u25cf shortages of qualified trades people and other labor;\n\u25cf changes in laws relating to union organizing activity;\n\u25cf inadequately capitalized or uninsured local subcontractors;\n\u25cf lack of availability of adequate utility infrastructure and services; and\n\u25cf transportation cost increases.\nThese difficulties can, and often do, cause unexpected short-term increases in construction costs and cause construction delays. In addition, to the extent our subcontractors incur increased costs associated with higher insurance premiums and compliance with regulations, these costs may be passed on to us. We are generally unable to pass on any unexpected increases in construction costs to those customers who have already entered into sales contracts, as those contracts generally fix the price of the building at the time the contract is signed. Pricing competition, oversupply of new and existing buildings and tightening mortgage qualifications, among other factors may restrict our ability to pass on any additional costs, and may negatively impact its profit margins.\nWe have not experienced any work stoppages due to strikes by unionized workers, but there is no assurance that there will not be any work stoppages due to strikes or other job actions in the future.\nRisks of Being a Public Company\nAs a result of the merger between a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and SG Building in November 2011, we have become subject to more reporting requirements of federal securities laws, which can be expensive.\nAs a result of the merger between a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and SG Building in November 2011, we have become an operating company. See the section entitled \u201c Description of Business - SG Blocks Merger \u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the Merger. Accordingly, we are subject to more information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and other Federal securities laws, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including reporting of the Merger) and furnishing audited reports to stockholders have increased and caused our expenses to be higher.\nIn addition, it may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop and implement the internal controls and reporting procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may need to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other finance personnel in order to develop and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures. If we are unable to comply with the internal controls requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to obtain the independent registered public accountant certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nBecause we were previously a shell company and acquired an operating entity by means of a reverse merger with one of our subsidiaries, we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms.\nThere may be risks associated with us formerly being a shell company and acquiring an operating entity through a \u201creverse merger\u201d. Securities analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage of us since there is no incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. No assurance can be given that brokerage firms will, in the future, want to conduct any secondary offerings on our behalf. In addition, the ability of stockholders to sell their shares under Rule 144 can be prohibited if the Company is not current in their SEC filings.\nRisks Relating to our common stock\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf intellectual property disputes;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock;\n\u25cf our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u25cf operating results that fall below expectations;\n\u25cf loss of any strategic relationship;\n\u25cf industry developments;\n\u25cf economic and other external factors; and\n\u25cf period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur limited operating history makes evaluating our common stock more difficult, and therefore, investors have limited information upon which to rely.\nWe have limited historical data upon which to forecast operating expenses or future needs and operating results. Our limited operating history will make it difficult for investors to evaluate our business and prospects. Investors must consider our prospects in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties we face as an early stage company with a limited operating history, new organizational structure and operating in a highly regulated and competitive industry.\nOur directors, executive officers and affiliated persons beneficially own a substantial number of shares of our common stock, which gives them significant control over certain major decisions upon which the Company\u2019s stockholders may vote and may discourage an acquisition of the Company.\nOur executive officers, directors and affiliated persons (including holders of Preferred Stock and investors holding convertible debentures and other convertible securities described herein) beneficially own a substantial number of shares of our common stock. The interests of our officers, directors and affiliated persons (as stockholders) may differ from the interests of other stockholders. As a result, these officers, directors and affiliated persons will have significant influence over all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, irrespective of how other stockholders may vote, including the following actions:\n\u25cf elect or defeat the election of the our directors;\n\u25cf amend or prevent amendment the our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws;\n\u25cf effect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and\n\u25cf control the outcome of any other matter submitted to the stockholders for vote.\nOwnership by Management and affiliated persons of a substantial number of shares of our common stock and convertible securities may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company, which in turn could reduce its stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over its stock price.\nTrading of our common stock may be restricted by Blue Sky eligibility and our common stock may be deemed a \u201cpenny stock\u201d, which would make it more difficult for the Company\u2019s investors to sell their shares.\nWe currently are not Blue Sky eligible in certain states so trading of the Company\u2019s stock in such states may be restricted. In addition, our common stock is subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules adopted under section 15(g) of theExchange Act. The penny stock rules apply to non-Nasdaq companies whose common stock trades at less than $5.00 per share or that have tangible net worth of less than $5,000,000 ($2,000,000 if the company has been operating for three or more years). These rules require, among other things, that brokers who trade penny stock to persons other than \u201cestablished customers\u201d complete certain documentation, make suitability inquiries of investors and provide investors with certain information concerning trading in the security, including a risk disclosure document and quote information under certain circumstances. Many brokers have decided not to trade penny stocks because of the requirements of the penny stock rules and, as a result, the number of broker-dealers willing to act as market makers in such securities is limited. If we remain subject to the penny stock rules for any significant period, that could have an adverse effect on the market, if any, for our securities. If our securities are subject to the penny stock rules, investors will find it more difficult to dispose of the common stock. In addition, the Blue Sky eligibility rules may discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of, the common stock.\nFurthermore, for companies whose securities are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board of the National Association of Security Dealers, Inc., it is more difficult (1) to obtain accurate quotations, (2) to obtain coverage for significant news events because major wire services generally do not publish press releases about such companies, and (3) to obtain needed capital.\nSale of a substantial number of shares of the common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of the common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could fall. These sales also may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that it deems reasonable or appropriate.\nThe issuance of additional securities by the Board will dilute the ownership interests of our current stockholders and could discourage the acquisition of the Company.\nOur Board, without any action by our stockholders, is authorized to designate and issue additional classes or series of capital stock (including classes or series of preferred stock) as it deems appropriate and to establish the rights, preferences and privileges of such classes or series. The issuance of any new class or series of capital stock would not only dilute the ownership interest of our current stockholders but may also adversely affect the voting power and other rights of holders of common stock. The rights of holders of preferred stock and other classes of common stock that may be issued may be superior to the rights of the holders of the existing class of common stock in terms of the payment of ordinary and liquidating dividends and voting rights.\nIn addition, the ability of the Board to designate and issue such undesignated shares could impede or deter an unsolicited tender offer or takeover proposal regarding the Company and the issuance of additional shares having preferential rights could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of holders of common stock and render more difficult the removal of current management, even if such removal may be in the stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nAdditional equity offerings may dilute current stockholders.\nWe have completed a number of capital raises in past that have resulted in significant dilution of our stockholders. Our most recent capital raise occurred in connection with our Bankruptcy Proceedings. As a result of acquisitions or additional capital raisings, we may issue additional securities or instruments that may be convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for, or otherwise entitle the holder thereof to receive common stock. The issuance of such additional securities will dilute the ownership of our then current stockholders. See Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Bankruptcy Proceedings\nIf we do not implement necessary internal control over financial reporting in an efficient and timely manner, or if we discover deficiencies and weaknesses in existing systems and controls, we could be subject to regulatory enforcement and investors may lose confidence in our ability to operate in compliance with existing internal control rules and regulations, either of which could result in a decline in our stock price.\nIt may be difficult to design and implement effective internal control over financial reporting for combined operations as the Company integrates the business of SG Building it acquired as a result of the Merger, and perhaps other acquired businesses in the future. In addition, differences in existing controls of acquired businesses may result in weaknesses that require remediation when internal controls over financial reporting are combined.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud. If we are unable to assert that its internal control over financial reporting is effective at any time in the future, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest to the effectiveness of internal controls, is unable to deliver a report at all or can deliver only a qualified report, we could be subject to regulatory enforcement and investors may lose confidence in our ability to operate in compliance with existing internal control rules and regulations, either of which could result in a decline in the our stock price.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have never paid nor do we expect in the foreseeable future to pay any dividends.\nThere is a limited trading market for our common stock.\nOur common stock has been quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board since 1999 and is currently quoted under the symbol \u201cSGBX\u201d. Prior to November 9, 2011, our common stock was quoted under the symbol \u201cCDSI.\u201d There is a limited trading market in our shares and a stockholder could likely find it difficult to sell or to obtain quotations as to prices of our common stock. Since the consummation of the Merger on November 4, 2011 there has been limited trading volume of our common stock, and on many days there has been no trading activity in our common stock.\nNo assurances can be given that our common stock will continue to be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or that an orderly trading market will be maintained for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 16802, "SIC": 3440, "TIC": "SGBX"}
