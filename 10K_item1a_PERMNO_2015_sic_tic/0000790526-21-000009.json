{"cik": "790526", "company": "RadNet, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Operations and Third-Party Relationships\nIf our contracted radiology practices terminate their agreements with us, our business could substantially diminish.\nOur relationship with professional corporations contracted to provide medical services is an integral part of our business. These professional corporations must use their best efforts to provide medical services at any new facilities that we open or acquire in their areas of operation. In addition, these professional corporation's strong relationships with referring physicians are largely responsible for the revenue generated at the facilities they service. Although our management agreements are for multiple years, the radiology groups have the right to terminate the agreements if we default on our obligations and fail to cure the default. Also, the various radiology groups\u2019 ability to continue performing under the management agreements may be curtailed or eliminated due to the groups\u2019 financial difficulties, loss of physicians or other circumstances. If the radiology groups cannot perform their obligations to us, we would need to contract with one or more other radiology groups to provide the professional medical services at the facilities serviced by the group. We may not be able to locate radiology groups willing to provide those services on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Even if we were able to do so, any replacement radiology group\u2019s relationships with referring physicians may not be as extensive as those of the terminated group. In any such event, our business could be seriously harmed. In addition, the radiology groups are party to substantially all of the managed care contracts from which we derive revenue. If we were unable to readily replace these contracts, our revenue would be negatively affected.\nOur ability to generate revenue depends in large part on referrals from physicians.\nWe derive substantially all of our net revenue, directly or indirectly, from fees charged for the diagnostic imaging services performed at our facilities. We depend on referrals of patients from unaffiliated physicians and other third parties who have no contractual obligations to refer patients to us for a substantial portion of the services we perform. If a sufficiently large number of these physicians and other third parties were to discontinue referring patients to us, our scan volume could decrease, which would reduce our net revenue and operating margins. Further, commercial third-party payors have implemented programs that could limit the ability of physicians to refer patients to us. For example, prepaid healthcare plans, such as health maintenance organizations, sometimes contract directly with providers and require their enrollees to obtain these services exclusively from those providers. Some insurance companies and self-insured employers also limit these services to contracted providers. These \u201cclosed panel\u201d systems are now common in the managed care environment. Other systems create an economic disincentive for referrals to providers outside the system\u2019s designated panel of providers. If we are unable to compete successfully for these managed care contracts, our results and prospects for growth could be adversely affected.\nIf our contracted radiology practices, including the Group, lose a significant number of their radiologists, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nAt times, there has been a shortage of qualified radiologists in some of the regional markets we serve. In addition, competition in recruiting radiologists may make it difficult for our contracted radiology practices to maintain adequate levels of radiologists. If a significant number of radiologists terminate their relationships with our contracted radiology practices and those radiology practices cannot recruit sufficient qualified radiologists to fulfill their obligations under our agreements with them, our ability to maximize the use of our diagnostic imaging facilities and our financial results could be adversely affected. Increased expenses for the Group will impact our financial results because the management fee we receive from them, which is based on a percentage of their collections, is adjusted annually to take into account their expenses as applicable. Neither we, nor our contracted radiology practices, maintain insurance on the lives of any affiliated physicians.\nWe may become subject to professional malpractice liability, which could be costly and negatively impact our business.\nThe physicians employed by our contracted radiology practices are from time to time subject to malpractice claims. We structure our relationships with the practices under our management agreements in a manner that we believe does not constitute the practice of medicine by us or subject us to professional malpractice claims for acts or omissions of physicians employed by the contracted radiology practices. Nevertheless, claims, suits or complaints relating to services provided by the contracted radiology practices have been asserted against us in the past and may be asserted against us in the future. In addition, we may be subject to professional liability claims, including, without limitation, for improper use or malfunction of our diagnostic imaging equipment or for accidental contamination or injury from exposure to radiation. We may not be able to maintain adequate liability insurance to protect us against those claims at acceptable costs or at all.\nHistorically, we have sought to manage this risk of loss by, among other things, purchasing professional liability insurance. However, the insurer from which we purchased such insurance for the period ending July 15, 2017, Fairway Physicians Insurance Company, A Risk Retention Group (\u201cFairway\u201d), experienced financial hardship. As a result, on August 29, 2017, the District of Columbia Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking (\u201cDISB\u201d) found that Fairway was statutorily insolvent and that its continued operation would be hazardous to its policyholders, creditors and the general public. On October 25, 2017, the Superior Court for the District of Columbia issued an order authorizing the DISB Commissioner to liquidate Fairway. Fairway\u2019s liquidation is currently pending, and it is presently unknown whether the Fairway liquidation estate will be able to pay covered policyholder claims, including claims asserted against us.\nAny claim made against us that is not fully covered by insurance could be costly to defend, result in a substantial damage award against us and divert the attention of our management from our operations, all of which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. In addition, successful claims against us may adversely affect our business or reputation. Although California places a $250,000 limit on non-economic damages for medical malpractice cases, no limit applies to economic damages and no such limits exist in the other states in which we provide services.\nWe may not receive payment from some of our healthcare provider customers because of their financial circumstances.\nSome of our healthcare provider customers do not have significant financial resources, liquidity or access to capital. If these customers experience financial difficulties they may be unable to pay us for the equipment and services that we provide. A significant deterioration in general or local economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the financial health of certain of our healthcare provider customers. As a result, we may have to increase the amounts of accounts receivables that we write-off, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCapitation fee arrangements could reduce our operating margins.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived approximately 13% of our total net revenue from capitation arrangements, and we intend to increase the revenue we derive from capitation arrangements in the future. Under capitation arrangements, the payor pays a pre-determined amount per-patient per-month in exchange for us providing all necessary covered services to the patients covered under the arrangement. These contracts pass much of the financial risk of providing diagnostic imaging services, including the risk of over-use, from the payor to the provider. Our success depends in part on our ability to negotiate effectively, on behalf of the contracted radiology practices and our diagnostic imaging facilities, contracts with health maintenance organizations, employer groups and other third-party payors for services to be provided on a capitated basis and to efficiently manage the utilization of those services. If we are not successful in managing the utilization of services under these capitation arrangements or if patients or enrollees covered by these contracts require more frequent or extensive care than anticipated, we would incur unanticipated costs not offset by additional revenue, which would reduce operating margins.\nChanges in the method or rates of third-party reimbursement could have a negative impact on our results\nFrom time to time, changes designed to contain healthcare costs have been implemented, some of which have resulted in decreased reimbursement rates for diagnostic imaging services that impact our business.\nOn August 4, 2020, CMS released the 2021 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule proposed rules, which proposed significant payment reductions effective January 1, 2021 for radiology services as a result of a proposed new coding structure for the office/outpatient evaluation and management (E/M) and statutorily mandated budget neutrality rules. While the Consolidated Appropriations Acct, 2021 (H.R. 133), enacted on December 27, 2020, mitigated the reimbursement cuts for 2021, H.R. 133 does not completely eliminate the cuts and only reduces their impact for 2021. Moreover, absent further and more permanent intervention from Congress, CMS could propose and impose similar or more significant reimbursement cuts in the years ahead, thus negatively impacting our revenue.\nDisruption or malfunction in our information systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information. A significant portion of the communication between personnel, customers, business partners, and suppliers depends on information technology. We rely on our information systems to perform functions critical to our ability to operate, including patient scheduling, billing, collections, image storage and image transmission. We also use information technology systems and networks in our operations and supporting departments such as marketing, accounting, finance, and human resources. The future success and growth of our business depends on streamlined processes made available through information systems, global communications, internet activity and other network processes.\nOur information technology systems, and those of our third-party service providers, have been and may again in the future be vulnerable to information security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses and interruption or loss of valuable business data. Our information technology system is vulnerable to damage or interruption from:\n\u2022earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural disasters;\n\u2022power losses, computer systems failures, internet and telecommunications or data network failures, operator negligence, improper operation by or supervision of employees, physical and electronic losses of data and similar events; and\n\u2022computer viruses, penetration by hackers seeking to disrupt operations or misappropriate information and other breaches of security.\nWe have technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate our risk to these vulnerabilities, but these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to ensure that our operations are not disrupted or that data security breaches do not occur.\nWe suffered an unauthorized access to our network and could again face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet or to introduce malicious software to our information technology systems. If a malicious hacker gained unauthorized access to our systems and network, it could have a material adverse impact on our business or operations. Such incidents, whether or not successful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. In addition, these threats are constantly changing, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventive measures. Accordingly, an extended interruption in our information technology system\u2019s function could significantly curtail, directly and indirectly, our ability to conduct our business and generate revenue.\nIf our network was compromised, it could give rise to unwanted media attention, materially damage our payor and physician relationships, harm our business, reputation, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, result in fines or lawsuits, and may increase the costs we incur to protect against such information security breaches, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with consumer protection laws and costs resulting from consumer fraud. While we maintain cyber liability insurance, our insurance may not be sufficient to protect against all losses we may incur if we suffer significant or multiple attacks.\nTechnological change in our industry could reduce the demand for our services and require us to incur significant costs to upgrade our equipment.\nThe development of new technologies or refinements of existing modalities may require us to upgrade and enhance our existing equipment before we may otherwise intend. Many companies currently manufacture diagnostic imaging equipment. Competition among manufacturers for a greater share of the diagnostic imaging equipment market may result in technological advances in the speed and imaging capacity of new equipment. This may accelerate the obsolescence of our equipment, and we may not have the financial ability to acquire the new or improved equipment and may not be able to maintain a competitive equipment base. In addition, advances in technology may enable physicians and others to perform diagnostic imaging procedures without us. If we are unable to deliver our services in the efficient and effective manner that payors, physicians and patients expect our revenue could substantially decrease.\nRisks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business\nWe face various risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face various risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, including the global outbreak of COVID-19. the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in patient behavior related to illness, pandemic fears and market downturns, and restrictions intended to slow the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, government-mandated actions, stay-at-home orders and other restrictions, have led to disruption of our business and volatility in the global capital markets. The United States government has taken steps to attempt to mitigate some of the more severe anticipated effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). Additionally, we have received some funding from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services under the CARES Act's Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF), which is geared towards supporting healthcare related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19. Nonetheless, no assurance that such types of measures and funding whether already enacted or to be enacted, including H.R. 133, will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion, including as it relates to our business operations. Moreover, while we believe we are in compliance with the applicable terms and conditions of funding under PHSSEF, compliance-related guidance for the program remains in process, and we may face enforcement risk if we are found to have failed to comply with such terms and conditions.\nIf significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including because of illness, quarantines, facility closures, ineffective remote work arrangements or technology failures or limitations, our operations would be adversely impacted.\nWe currently believe our results of operations will continue to be negatively impacted by these developments. In addition, changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or practices as a result of, or in response to COVID-19, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Given the many uncertainties and far-reaching consequences of potential developments, we cannot assure that the COVID-19 outbreak and the many related impacts will not require extended or additional diagnostic center closures and other disruptions to our business or will not materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition for significant periods of time moving forward.\nPressure to control healthcare costs could have a negative impact on our results.\nOne of the principal objectives of health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations is to control the cost of healthcare services. Healthcare providers participating in managed care plans may be required to refer diagnostic imaging tests to certain providers depending on the plan in which a covered patient is enrolled. In addition, managed care contracting has become very competitive, and reimbursement schedules are at or below Medicare reimbursement levels. The expansion of health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and other managed care organizations within the geographic areas covered by our network could have a negative impact on the utilization and pricing of our services, because these organizations will exert greater control over patients\u2019 access to diagnostic imaging services, the selections of the provider of such services and reimbursement rates for those services.\nWe experience competition from other diagnostic imaging companies and hospitals, and this competition could adversely affect our revenue and business.\nThe market for diagnostic imaging services is highly competitive. We compete for patients principally on the basis of our reputation, our ability to provide multiple modalities at many of our facilities, the location of our facilities and the quality of our diagnostic imaging services. We compete locally with groups of radiologists, established hospitals, clinics and other independent organizations that own and operate imaging equipment. Our competitors include independent imaging operators, such as Alliance Healthcare and smaller regional operators, as well as hospitals and hospital groups that operate their own imaging services. Some of our competitors may now or in the future have access to greater financial resources than we do and may have access to newer, more advanced equipment. In addition, some physician practices have established their own diagnostic imaging facilities within their group practices and compete with us. We are experiencing increased competition as a result of such activities, and if we are unable to successfully compete, our business and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our key personnel and loss of key executives could adversely affect our operations. In addition, former employees and radiology practices we have previously contracted with could use the experience and relationships developed while employed or under contract with us to compete with us.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified senior and executive management, and managerial and technical personnel. Competition in recruiting these personnel may make it difficult for us to continue our growth and success. The loss of their services or our inability in the future to attract and retain management and other key personnel could hinder the implementation of our business strategy. The loss of the services of Dr. Howard G. Berger, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Norman R. Hames or Stephen M. Forthuber, our Chief Operating Officers, West Coast and East Coast, respectively, could have a significant negative impact on our operations. We believe that they could not easily be replaced with executives of equal experience and capabilities. Additionally, if we lose the services of Dr. Berger, our relationship with BRMG could deteriorate, which would materially adversely affect our business.\nMany of the states in which we operate do not enforce agreements that prohibit a former employee from competing with a former employer. As a result, many of our employees whose employment is terminated are free to compete with us, subject to prohibitions on the use of trade secret information and, depending on the terms of the employee\u2019s employment agreement, on solicitation of existing employees and customers (if enforceable). A former executive, manager or other key employee who joins one of our competitors could use the relationships he or she established with third party payors, radiologists or referring physicians while our employee and the industry knowledge he or she acquired during that tenure to enhance the new employer\u2019s ability to compete with us.\nThe agreements with most of our radiology practices contain non-compete provisions; however the enforceability of these provisions is determined by a court based on all the facts and circumstances of the specific case at the time enforcement is sought. Our inability to enforce radiologists\u2019 non-compete provisions could result in increased competition from individuals who are knowledgeable about our business strategies and operations.\nOur failure to successfully, and in a timely manner, integrate acquired businesses and/or new lines of businesses could reduce our profitability.\nWe may never realize expected synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects in connection with our acquisitions and joint ventures. We may not be able to capitalize on expected business opportunities, assumptions underlying estimates of expected cost savings may be inaccurate, or general industry and business conditions may deteriorate. In addition, integrating operations will require significant efforts and expense on our part. Personnel may leave or be terminated because of an acquisition. Our management may have its attention diverted while trying to integrate an acquisition. If these factors limit our ability to integrate the operations of an acquisition successfully or on a timely basis, our expectations of future results of operations, including certain cost savings and synergies as a result of the acquisition, may not be met.\nIn the past we have acquired, and may again in the future acquire, companies that create a new line of business. The process of integrating the acquired business, technology, service and research and development component into our business and operations and entry into a new line of business in which we are inexperienced may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In developing a new line of business, we may invest significant time and resources that take away the attention of management that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that our new lines of business will ultimately be successful. The failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business could have a material, adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully grow our business, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nHistorically, we have experienced substantial growth through acquisitions that have increased our size, scope and geographic distribution. During the past two fiscal years, we have completed 9 acquisitions. These acquisitions have added 22 centers to our fixed-site outpatient diagnostic imaging services. Our ability to successfully expand through acquiring facilities, developing new facilities, adding equipment at existing facilities, and directly or indirectly entering into contractual relationships with high-quality radiology practices depends upon many factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022identify attractive and willing candidates for acquisitions;\n\u2022identify locations in existing or new markets for development of new facilities;\n\u2022comply with legal requirements affecting our arrangements with contracted radiology practices;\n\u2022obtain regulatory approvals where necessary and comply with licensing and certification requirements applicable to our diagnostic imaging facilities, the contracted radiology practices and their associated physicians;\n\u2022recruit a sufficient number of qualified radiology technologists and other non-medical personnel;\n\u2022expand our infrastructure and management; and\n\u2022compete for opportunities.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively for the acquisition of diagnostic imaging facilities. Our competitors may have more established operating histories and greater resources than we do. Competition may also make any acquisitions more expensive. If we are unable to successfully grow our business through acquisitions it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA restriction in our ability to make capital expenditures would restrict our growth and could adversely affect our business.\nWe operate in a capital intensive, high fixed-cost industry that requires significant amounts of capital to fund operations, particularly the initial start-up and development expenses of new diagnostic imaging facilities and the acquisition of additional facilities and new diagnostic imaging equipment. We incur capital expenditures to, among other things, upgrade and replace equipment for existing facilities and expand within our existing markets and enter new markets. If we open or acquire additional imaging facilities, we may have to incur material capital lease obligations. To the extent we are unable to generate sufficient cash from our operations, funds are not available from our lenders or we are unable to structure or obtain financing through operating leases, finance leases or long-term installment notes, we may be unable to meet our capital expenditure requirements to support the maintenance and continued growth of our operations.\nRisks Related to Healthcare Laws and Regulations\nThe regulatory framework in which we operate is uncertain and evolving.\nAlthough we believe that we are operating in compliance with applicable federal and state laws, neither our current or anticipated business operations nor the operations of the contracted radiology practices have been the subject of judicial or regulatory interpretation. We cannot assure you that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that restricts our operations. In addition, healthcare laws and regulations may change significantly in the future. We continuously monitor these developments and modify our operations from time to time as the regulatory environment changes. We cannot assure you however, that we will be able to adapt our operations to address new regulations or that new regulations will not adversely affect our business.\nCertain states have enacted statutes or adopted regulations affecting risk assumption in the healthcare industry, including statutes and regulations that subject any physician or physician network engaged in risk-based managed care contracting to comply with applicable insurance laws. These laws, if adopted in the states in which we operate, may require physicians and physician networks to meet minimum capital requirements and other safety and soundness requirements. Implementing additional regulations or compliance requirements could result in substantial costs to us and the contracted radiology practices and limit our ability to enter into capitation or other risk-sharing managed care arrangements.\nWe may be impacted by eligibility changes to government and private insurance programs.\nDue to potential decreased availability of healthcare through private employers, the number of patients who are uninsured or participate in governmental programs may increase. Healthcare reform legislation will increase the participation of individuals in the Medicaid program in states that elect to participate in the expanded Medicaid coverage. A shift in payor mix from managed care and other private payors to government payors as well as an increase in the number of uninsured patients may result in a reduction in the rates of reimbursement or an increase in uncollectible receivables or uncompensated care, with a corresponding decrease in net revenue. Changes in the eligibility requirements for governmental programs and state decisions on whether to participate in the expansion of such programs also could increase the number of patients who participate in such programs and the number of uninsured patients. Even for those patients who remain in private insurance plans, changes to those plans could increase patient financial responsibility, resulting in a greater risk of uncollectible receivables. Furthermore, additional changes to, or repeal of, the PPACA, whether through legislation or judicial action, may also affect reimbursement and coverage in ways that are currently unpredictable. These factors and events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nState and federal anti-kickback and anti-self-referral laws may adversely affect income.\nVarious federal and state laws govern financial arrangements among healthcare providers. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, the referral of Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare program patients, or in return for, or to induce, the purchase, lease or order of items or services that are covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. Similarly, many state laws prohibit the solicitation, payment or receipt of remuneration in return for, or to induce the referral of patients in private as well as government programs. Violation of these anti-kickback laws may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties for individuals or entities and/or exclusion from federal or state healthcare programs. We believe we are operating in compliance with applicable law and believe that our arrangements with providers would not be found to violate the anti-kickback laws. However, these laws could be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with our operations.\nFederal law prohibiting certain physician self-referrals, known as the Stark Law, prohibits a physician from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity for certain \u201cdesignated health services\u201d if the physician has a prohibited financial relationship with that entity, unless an exception applies. Certain radiology services are considered \u201cdesignated health services\u201d under the Stark Law. Although we believe our operations do not violate the Stark Law, our activities may be challenged. If a challenge is successful, it could have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, legislation may be enacted in the future that further addresses Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse or imposes additional regulatory burdens on us.\nIn addition, under the DRA, states enacting false claims statutes similar to the federal False Claims Act, which establish liability for submission of fraudulent claims to the State Medicaid program and contain qui tam or whistleblower provisions, receive an increased percentage of any recovery from a State Medicaid judgment or settlement. Adoption of new false claims statutes in states where we operate may impose additional burdens on us.\nFederal and state privacy and information security laws are complex, and if we fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, or if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, protect our proprietary rights to our systems, or defend against cybersecurity attacks, we may be subject to government or private actions due to privacy and security breaches, and our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks. We must comply with numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection, dissemination, access, use, security and privacy of PHI, including HIPAA and its implementing privacy and security regulations, as amended by the federal HITECH Act and collectively referred to as HIPAA. Information security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including foreign state agents. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, regulations and standards, properly maintain the integrity of our data, protect our proprietary rights to our systems, or defend against cybersecurity attacks, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are continuously implementing multiple layers of security measures. We utilize current security technologies and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. Despite these efforts, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to privacy and security incidents; security attacks and breaches; acts of vandalism or theft; computer viruses; coordinated attacks by activist entities; emerging cybersecurity risks; misplaced or lost data; programming and/or\nhuman errors; or other similar events. Emerging and advanced security threats, including coordinated attacks, require additional layers of security which may disrupt or impact efficiency of operations.\nAny security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information, including protected health information, financial data, competitively sensitive information, or other proprietary data, whether by us or a third party, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. The occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data, cessations in the availability of systems or liability under privacy and security laws, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation. If we are unable to protect the physical and electronic security and privacy of our databases and transactions, we could be subject to potential liability and regulatory action, our reputation and relationships with our patients and vendors would be harmed, and our business, operations, and financial results may be materially adversely affected. Failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems (including our networks) and data, or to defend against cybersecurity attacks, could subject us to monetary fines, civil suits, civil penalties or criminal sanctions and requirements to disclose the breach publicly, and may further result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nComplying with federal and state regulations is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties.\nWe are directly or indirectly, through the radiology practices with which we contract, subject to extensive regulation by both the federal government and the state governments in which we provide services, including:\n\u2022the federal False Claims Act;\n\u2022the federal Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback Statute, and state anti-kickback prohibitions;\n\u2022federal and state billing and claims submission laws and regulations;\n\u2022HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and comparable state laws;\n\u2022the federal physician self-referral prohibition commonly known as the Stark Law and state equivalents;\n\u2022state laws that prohibit the corporate practice of medicine and prohibit similar fee-splitting arrangements;\n\u2022federal and state laws governing the diagnostic imaging and therapeutic equipment we use in our business concerning patient safety, equipment operating specifications and radiation exposure levels; and\n\u2022state laws governing reimbursement for diagnostic services related to services compensable under workers' compensation rules.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws and regulations to which we or the radiology practices with which we contract are subject, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines or curtailment of our operations, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risks of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action brought against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nIf we fail to comply with various licensure, certification and accreditation standards, we may be subject to loss of licensure, certification or accreditation, which would adversely affect our operations.\nOwnership, construction, operation, expansion and acquisition of our diagnostic imaging facilities are subject to various federal and state laws, regulations and approvals concerning licensing of personnel, other required certificates for certain types of healthcare facilities and certain medical equipment. In addition, freestanding diagnostic imaging facilities that provide services independent of a physician\u2019s office must be enrolled by Medicare as an independent diagnostic treatment facility, or IDTF, to bill the Medicare program. Medicare carriers have discretion in applying the IDTF requirements and therefore the application of these requirements may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, federal legislation requires all suppliers that provide the technical component of diagnostic MRI, PET/CT, CT, and nuclear medicine to be accredited by an accreditation organization designated by CMS (which currently include the American College of Radiology (ACR), the Intersocietal Accreditation Commission (IAC) and the Joint Commission). Our MRI, CT, nuclear medicine, ultrasound and mammography facilities are currently accredited by the American College of Radiology. We may not be able to receive the required regulatory approvals or accreditation for any future acquisitions, expansions or replacements, and the failure to obtain these approvals could limit the opportunity to expand our services.\nOur facilities are subject to periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to assure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for licensure and certification. If any facility loses its certification under the Medicare program, then the facility will be ineligible to receive reimbursement from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 20% and 2% of our net service fee revenue came from Medicare and various state Medicaid programs, respectively. A change in the applicable certification status of one of our facilities could adversely affect our other facilities and in turn us as a whole. Credentialing of physicians is required by our payors prior to commencing payment. We have experienced a slowdown in the credentialing of our physicians over the last several years which has lengthened our billing and collection cycle, and could negatively impact our ability to collect revenue from patients covered by Medicare.\nOur agreements with the contracted radiology practices must be structured to avoid the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting.\nThe laws of certain states prohibit us from exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of physicians and from engaging in certain financial arrangements, such as splitting professional fees with physicians. These laws are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. A component of our business has been to enter into management agreements with radiology practices. We provide management, administrative, technical and other non-medical services to the radiology practices in exchange for a service fee typically based on a percentage of the practice\u2019s revenue. We structure our relationships with the radiology practices, including the purchase of diagnostic imaging facilities, in a manner that we believe keeps us from engaging in the practice of medicine or exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of the radiology practices or their physicians, or violating the prohibitions against fee-splitting. There can be no assurance that our present arrangements with the Group or the physicians providing medical services and medical supervision at our imaging facilities will not be challenged, and, if challenged, that they will not be found to violate the corporate practice of medicine or fee splitting prohibitions, thus subjecting us to potential damages, injunction and/or civil and criminal penalties or require us to restructure our arrangements in a way that would affect the control or quality of our services and/or change the amounts we receive under our management agreements. Any of these results could jeopardize our business.\nSome of our imaging modalities use radioactive materials, which generate regulated waste and could subject us to liabilities for injuries or violations of environmental and health and safety laws.\nSome of our imaging procedures use radioactive materials, which generate medical and other regulated wastes. For example, patients are injected with a radioactive substance before undergoing a PET scan. Storage, use and disposal of these materials and waste products present the risk of accidental environmental contamination and physical injury. We are subject to federal, state and local regulations governing storage, handling and disposal of these materials. We could incur significant costs and the diversion of our management\u2019s attention in order to comply with current or future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. Also, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these hazardous materials. Although we maintain professional liability insurance coverage in amounts we believe is consistent with industry practice in the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed the limits of or fall outside the coverage of our professional liability insurance.\nGeneral Economic, Legal, Tax and Financial Risks\nAdverse changes in general domestic and worldwide economic conditions and instability and disruption of credit markets could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, or liquidity.\nWe are subject to risk arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions, including recession or economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets. Continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long-term and wide-spread recession, inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the United States economy. The United States and other western countries have responded to this economic situation by exercising monetary policy to keep interest rates low. Any significant change in economic conditions or change in fiscal monetary policy could result in material changes in interest rates.\nContinued turbulence in domestic and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and the liquidity and financial condition of our patients. If these market conditions continue, they may increase expenses associated with borrowing, limit our ability to timely replace maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs, resulting in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBusiness disruptions and interruptions due to external events beyond our control can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations can be subject to external events beyond our control, such as the effects of earthquakes, fires, floods, severe weather, public health issues, power failures, telecommunication loss, and other natural and man-made events, some of which may be intensified by the effects of climate change and changing weather patterns. Our corporate headquarters and over 100 of our radiology centers are located in California, which is subject to wildfires, blackouts, and potentially damaging earthquakes. In addition, several of our facilities located in parts of the east coast have suffered from weather events that caused us to temporarily close facilities. More recently, the novel coronavirus outbreak has impacted our business. This or such other events could cause disruption or interruption to our operations and significantly impact our employees. Any disruption to our services may result in decreases in revenues or increased operating and capital expenses. Historically, when we have experienced a reduction in business due to inclement weather or external events for a period of time, our operations have returned to a normalized level, but we have not experience a significant increase of procedures that would fully compensate for the revenues lost during the slower periods.\nPossible volatility in our stock price could negatively affect us and our stockholders.\nThe trading price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market has fluctuated significantly in the past. During the period from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020, the trading price of our common stock fluctuated from a high of $23.45 per share to a low of $5.81 per share. In the past, we have experienced a drop in stock price following an announcement of disappointing earnings or earnings guidance. Any such announcement in the future could lead to a similar drop in stock price. The price of our common stock could also be subject to wide fluctuations in the future as a result of a number of other factors, including the following:\n\u2022changes in expectations as to future financial performance or buy/sell recommendations of securities analysts;\n\u2022our, or a competitor\u2019s, announcement of new services, or significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; and\n\u2022the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies.\nIn addition, the U.S. securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of companies in these markets. Broad market and industry factors may lead to volatility in the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of an individual company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation often has been instituted against that company. The institution of similar litigation against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur substantial debt could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness.\nOur current substantial indebtedness and any future indebtedness we incur could adversely affect our financial condition. We are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2020, our total combined indebtedness of term loans, capital leases and notes payable, excluding discount on term loan debt, was $662.4 million. Term loan indebtedness, excluding related discount, was $662.4 million, of which the Barclays first lien term loans were $611.0 million and the SunTrust term loan was $51.4 million. Our substantial indebtedness could also:\n\u2022make it difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022expose us to the risk of interest rate increases on our variable rate borrowings, including borrowings under our new senior secured credit facilities;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds on terms that are satisfactory to us or at all.\nWe may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to changes because of restrictions placed on us by our credit facilities and instruments governing our other indebtedness.\nOur credit facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants which restrict, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments or investments;\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness and certain disqualified equity interests;\n\u2022create liens (other than permitted liens) securing indebtedness or trade payables;\n\u2022sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022create restrictions on dividends or other payments by our restricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022create guarantees of indebtedness by restricted subsidiaries.\nAll of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. A failure to comply with these covenants and restrictions would permit the relevant creditors to declare all amounts borrowed under the applicable agreement governing such indebtedness, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If the indebtedness under our credit facilities is accelerated, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under the credit facilities or on other indebtedness then outstanding.\nOur business could be adversely impacted if there are deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting.\nThe design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While our management regularly reviews the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting that may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, or otherwise adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.\nWe are subject to tax audits, challenges to our tax positions, or adverse changes or interpretations of tax laws.\nWe are subject to federal and applicable state income tax laws and regulations. Income tax laws and regulations are often complex and require significant judgment in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. Our determination of our tax liability is subject to review by applicable tax authorities. Any audits or challenges of such determinations may adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments or financial condition. Recently enacted U.S. tax legislation, the most significant of which is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") , made significant changes to federal tax law, including the taxation of corporations, by, among other things, reducing the corporate income tax rate, disallowing certain deductions that had previously been allowed, and altering the expensing of capital expenditures.\nThe ultimate impact of the Tax Act may differ from our estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as potential amendments, technical corrections, and additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and any such changes could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Furthermore, future related changes may occur at the state level that could result in unfavorable adjustments to our tax liability.\nWe may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe recognized an impairment of goodwill and trade name in our Imaging On Call reporting unit in the amount of $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the current year of 2020 we ceased employing certain indefinite lived trade names with a total value of $4.2 million and they were written off in full. We are required to perform impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment exists or that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable, we recognize an impairment. A decline in the Company's operating results, future estimated cash flows and other assumptions could impact our estimated fair values, potentially leading to a material impairment of goodwill or other indefinite-lived assets, which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nBecause we have high fixed costs, lower scan volumes per system could adversely affect our business.\nThe principal components of our expenses, excluding depreciation, consist of debt service, capital lease payments, compensation paid to technologists, salaries, real estate lease expenses and equipment maintenance costs. Because a majority of these expenses are fixed, a relatively small change in our revenue could have a disproportionate effect on our operating and financial results depending on the source of our revenue. Thus, decreased revenue as a result of lower scan volumes per system could result in lower margins, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nProvisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and our organizational documents may discourage an acquisition of us.\nIn the future, we could become the subject of an unsolicited attempted takeover of our company. Although an unsolicited takeover could be in the best interests of our stockholders, our organizational documents and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware both contain provisions that will impede the removal of directors and may discourage a third-party from making a proposal to acquire us. For example, the provisions:\n\u2022permit the board of directors to increase its own size, within the maximum limitations set forth in the bylaws, and fill the resulting vacancies;\n\u2022authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock in one or more series without a stockholder vote;\n\u2022establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to the board of directors; and\n\u2022prohibit transfers and/or acquisitions of stock (without consent of the Board of Directors ) that would result in any stockholder owning greater than 5% of the currently outstanding stock resulting in a limitation on net operating loss carryovers, capital loss carryovers, general business credit carryovers, alternative minimum tax credit carryovers and foreign tax credit carryovers, as well as any loss or deduction attributable to a \u201cnet unrealized built-in loss\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended.\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.", "PERMNO": 76672, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "RDNT"}
