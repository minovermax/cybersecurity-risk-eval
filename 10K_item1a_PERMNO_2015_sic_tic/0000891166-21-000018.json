{"cik": "891166", "company": "UNIVERSAL INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to a variety of material risks, which are described below. Our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could have material and long-term adverse consequences on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity and capital resources.\nThe public health crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting and continuing impact on the global, national and local economies, as well as on the American workforce, could significantly disrupt and materially impact our business, including:\n\u2022our ability to successfully maintain operations and meet the costs associated with those operations while maintaining the safety and wellness of our employees, independent agents, policyholders and vendors;\n\u2022the impact on demand for our products by agents and policyholders during the current protracted economic downturn;\n\u2022the ability or willingness of policyholders to pay premiums;\n\u2022the prompt payment of receivables by reinsurers and policyholders;\n\u2022a decline in the value of our investment securities, which make up a significant portion of our financial resources;\n\u2022a decline in the credit ratings of our debt securities;\n\u2022our ability to meet regulatory requirements;\n\u2022our ability to attract and retain, and to effectively train and supervise, employees;\n\u2022our ability to anticipate, understand and respond to potential changes in consumer or employee behaviors and preferences arising from past and future directives and guidance related to social distancing, teleworking and similar considerations; and\n\u2022our ability to maintain relationships with key vendors, and those vendors\u2019 willingness or ability to perform services for us as expected.\nAs a provider of services typically categorized as essential, we are required to maintain operations and continue to pay claims to policyholders. Uncertainty around claims patterns including impediments to adjusting claims in the field could negatively impact our ability to timely and properly pay claims and establish reserves. Access to capital, if needed, could be hampered, and the cost of external capital could be elevated.\nIn addition, COVID-19 has reduced our ability to bring litigated matters to an efficient conclusion. Some courts have been unable to respond effectively to social distancing measures due to lack of technology or infrastructure and to the fragmented nature of local court systems. In many states, all civil trials were suspended or the number of civil trials taking place has been greatly limited. This has caused litigation related to first-party claims we are defending and subrogation actions we are pursuing to be held in suspense and delayed. In turn, this has caused an increase in our number of claims in litigation.\nBroader adverse economic consequences and losses incurred by reinsurers as a result of COVID-19 could erode capital and contribute to an increase in the cost of reinsurance as well as an increase in counterparty credit risk. Legislative, regulatory or judicial actions that encourage or mandate premium payment grace periods, prevent cancellations for non-payment of premium, require us to cover losses when our policies did not provide coverage or excluded coverage, or order us to provide premium refunds or make other accommodations, could reduce our liquidity and increase both our losses and operating costs. Forced liquidation of stressed investment securities could result in realized losses during periods of dysfunction and volatility in capital markets. An increase in the demand and frequency of reporting by regulators could place stress on our ability to accurately and timely meet those and existing demands, and a delay or denial in regulatory rate approvals could contribute to financial stress. While most of our workforce is continuing to work remotely, we are more vulnerable to cyber threats.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business will depend on future developments - including any resurgence or variants of COVID-19, the availability of effective treatments and the distribution of vaccines - and while we are not able to estimate the impact that COVID-19 will have on our future financial results and financial condition, it could be material. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our future business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below.\nAs a property and casualty insurer, we face significant losses when catastrophes and severe weather events occur.\nBecause of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events, our operating results and financial condition have varied significantly from one period to the next, and our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future results of operations. Property damage resulting from catastrophes is the greatest risk of loss we face in the ordinary course of our business. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man-made disasters, including hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes, tropical storms, sinkholes, windstorms, hailstorms, explosions, earthquakes and acts of terrorism. Because of our concentration in Florida, and in particular in Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties, we are exposed to hurricanes and windstorms, and other catastrophes affecting Florida. We have incurred and may in the future incur catastrophe losses in Florida or elsewhere in excess of those experienced in prior years; those estimated by catastrophe models we use; the average expected level used in pricing; and our current reinsurance coverage limits. We are also subject to claims arising from weather events such as rain, hail and high winds. The nature and level of future catastrophes and the incidence and severity of weather conditions in any future period cannot be predicted and could materially and adversely impact our operations.\nThe loss estimates developed by the models we use are dependent upon assumptions or scenarios incorporated by a third-party developer and by us. When these assumptions or scenarios do not reflect the characteristics of catastrophic events that affect areas covered by our policies or the resulting economic conditions, then we become exposed to losses not covered by our reinsurance program, which could adversely affect our financial condition, profitability and results of operations. Further, although we use widely recognized and commercially available models to estimate hurricane loss exposure, other models exist that might produce higher or lower loss estimates. See \u201c-We rely on models as a tool to evaluate risk, and those models are inherently uncertain and may not accurately predict existing or future losses.\u201d Despite our catastrophe management programs, we retain material exposure to catastrophic events. Our liquidity could also be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which could have a negative impact on our business. Catastrophes have eroded and in the future may erode our statutory surplus or ability to obtain adequate reinsurance which could negatively affect our ability to write new or renewal business. Catastrophic claim severity is impacted by the effects of inflation and increases in insured value and factors such as the overall claims, legal and litigation environments in affected areas, in addition to the geographic concentration of insured property.\nActual claims incurred have exceeded, and in the future may exceed, reserves established for claims, adversely affecting our operating results and financial condition.\nWe maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses and LAE for reported and unreported claims as of the end of each accounting period. The reserve for losses and LAE is reported net of receivables for subrogation. Recorded claim reserves in the property and casualty business are based on our best estimates of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, both reported and incurred but not reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d). These estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on management\u2019s assessment of known facts and circumstances, including our experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical trends involving claim payment patterns, pending levels of unpaid claims and contractual terms. External factors are also considered, which include but are not limited to changes in the law, court decisions, changes to regulatory requirements, economic conditions and consumer behavior. Many of these factors are not quantifiable and are subject to change over time. The current Florida homeowners\u2019 insurance market is adversely impacted by changes in claimant behaviors resulting in losses and LAE exceeding historical trends, amounts experienced in other states, and amounts we previously estimated. The increases in losses and LAE are attributable to the active solicitation of claims activity by policyholder representatives, high levels of represented claims compared to historical patterns or patterns seen in other states, and a proliferation of inflated claims filed by policyholder representatives and vendors. These trends are facilitated by Florida\u2019s legal climate, including the one-way threat of attorneys\u2019 fees against insurers and the relatively high cost of defending against inflated claims in relation to amounts in dispute.\nAdditionally, there sometimes is a significant reporting lag between the occurrence of an event and the time it is reported to us. The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities, particularly those in which the various considerations affecting the type of claim are subject to change and in which long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made. The deterioration in the current Florida market also has produced an increased number of claims that are filed or re-opened well after the alleged dates of loss. We continually refine reserve estimates as experience develops and as subsequent claims are reported and settled. Adjustments to reserves are reflected in the financial statement results of the periods in which such estimates are changed. The adverse conditions in Florida have resulted in our paid losses exceeding prior reserve estimates and in increases in our current estimates of unpaid losses and LAE. Because setting reserves is inherently uncertain and claims conditions change over time, the ultimate cost of losses has varied and, in the future, may vary materially from recorded reserves, and such variance may continue to adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The full extent of the ongoing disruptions and claims behaviors in the Florida market is unknown and still unfolding.\nSubrogation is a significant component of our total net reserves for losses and LAE. Starting in 2016, there has been a significant increase in our efforts to pursue subrogation against third parties responsible for property damage losses to our insureds. More recently, changes in Florida\u2019s claims environment and legal climate have reduced the effectiveness of our efforts to properly apportion losses through subrogation. Responsible parties are increasingly using delays and defensive tactics to avoid subrogation and increase its costs, which in turn decreases its effectiveness. In some instances, our ability to recover subrogation judgments against responsible parties also is being delayed or impeded by limitations on jury trials and similar changes to judicial processes due to COVID-19. Our ability to recover recorded amounts remains subject to significant uncertainty, including risks inherent in litigation, collectability of the recorded amounts and potential law changes or judicial decisions that can hinder or reduce the effectiveness of subrogation.\nWhen we fail to accurately and adequately price the risks we underwrite, we may not be able to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses and expenses and we may experience other negative impacts on our profitability and financial condition, including harm to our competitive position.\nOur results of operations and financial condition depend on our ability to underwrite and set premium rates accurately for a variety of risks. Rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, LAE, reinsurance costs and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit. In order to price our products accurately and adequately, we must collect and properly analyze a substantial amount of data; develop, test and apply appropriate rating formulas; closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends; and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy. We have partnered with an industry leading homeowners insurance data aggregator and have over 22 years of claims experience to leverage during the rate making process, most of which is in the State of Florida. During the Underwriting and rating process we also collect and leverage data points related to age, location, and construction characteristics that have rating implications, and establish Insurance to Value estimates for proper rating. Our ability to price our products accurately and adequately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside our control, including:\n\u2022the availability of sufficient and reliable data;\n\u2022regulatory review periods or delays in approving filed rate changes or our failure to gain regulatory approval;\n\u2022the uncertainties that inherently underlie estimates and assumptions;\n\u2022the ability to anticipate unforeseen adverse market trends or other emerging costs in the rate making process;\n\u2022changes in legal standards, claim resolution practices and restoration costs; and\n\u2022legislatively imposed consumer initiatives.\nAs a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our profit margins and result in significant underwriting losses. We could also overprice risks, which could reduce the number of policies we write and our competitiveness. In either event, our profitability could be materially and adversely affected. If our policies are overpriced or underpriced by geographic area, policy type or other characteristics, we may not be able to achieve desirable diversification in our risks.\nUnanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nChanges in the severity or frequency of claims affect our profitability. Changes in homeowners\u2019 claim severity can be and have been driven by inflation in the construction industry, in building materials and in home furnishings and by other economic and environmental factors, including increased demand for services and supplies in areas affected by catastrophes, market conditions and prevailing attitudes towards insurers and the claims process, including increases in the number of litigated claims or claims involving representation. However, changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation and demand surge in these various sectors of the economy. Increases in claim severity can also arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict. Significant long-term increases in claim frequency have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Further, the level of claim frequency we experience varies from period to period, or from region to region. Although we pursue various loss management initiatives in order to mitigate future increases in claim severity, there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity.\nThe failure of the risk mitigation strategies we utilize could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe utilize a number of strategies to mitigate our risk exposure, such as:\n\u2022engaging in rigorous underwriting;\n\u2022carefully evaluating terms and conditions of our policies and binding guidelines; and\n\u2022ceding risk to reinsurers.\nHowever, there are inherent limitations in all of these strategies, and no assurance can be given that an event or series of events will not result in loss levels in excess of our probable maximum loss models, or that our non-catastrophe forecasts or modeling is accurate, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. It is also possible that losses could manifest themselves in ways that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategies are not designed to address. Such a manifestation of losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we rely on independent insurance agents, the loss of these independent agent relationships and the business they control or our ability to attract new independent agents could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe currently market our policies to a broad range of prospective policyholders through approximately 4,400 independent insurance agents in Florida as well as approximately 5,800 independent insurance agents outside of Florida. As a result, our business depends on the marketing efforts of these independent agents and on our ability to offer products and services that meet their and their customers\u2019 requirements. These independent insurance agents maintain the primary customer relationship. Independent agents typically represent other insurance companies in addition to representing us, and such agents are not obligated to sell or promote our products. Other insurance companies may pay higher commissions than we do, provide services to the agents that we do not provide, or may be more attractive to the agents than we are. We cannot provide assurance that we will retain our current relationships, or be able to establish new relationships, with independent agents. The loss of these marketing relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract new agents, retain our agency network, or write new or renewal insurance policies, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on models as a tool to evaluate risk, and those models are inherently uncertain and may not accurately predict existing or future losses.\nAlong with other insurers in the industry, we use models developed by third-party vendors in assessing our exposure to catastrophe losses, and these models assume various conditions and probability scenarios, most of which are not known to us or are not within our control. These models may not accurately predict future losses or accurately measure losses incurred. Catastrophe models, which have been evolving since the early 1990s, use historical information about various catastrophes, detailed information about our in-force business and certain assumptions or judgments that are proprietary to the modeling firms. While we use this information in connection with our pricing and risk management activities, there are limitations with respect to their usefulness in predicting losses in any reporting period. Examples of these limitations are significant variations in estimates between models and modelers and material increases and decreases in model results due to changes and refinements of the underlying data elements and assumptions. Such limitations lead to questionable predictive capability and post-event measurements that have not been well understood or proven to be sufficiently reliable. In addition, the models are not necessarily reflective of company or state-specific policy language, demand surge for labor and materials, consumer behavior, prevailing or changing claims, legal and litigation environments, or loss settlement expenses, all of which are subject to wide variation by catastrophe.\nReinsurance may be unavailable in the future at reasonable levels and prices or on reasonable terms, which may limit our ability to write new business or to adequately mitigate our exposure to loss.\nOur reinsurance program is designed to mitigate our exposure to catastrophes. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase and the ability of the FHCF to reimburse insurers at levels contemplated by their reimbursement contracts. No assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same or similar terms and rates as are currently available. In addition, our ability to afford reinsurance to reduce our catastrophe risk may be dependent upon our ability to adjust premium rates for our costs, and there are no assurances that the terms and rates for our current reinsurance program will continue to be available next year or that we will be able to adjust our premiums. The Insurance Entities are responsible for losses related to catastrophic events with incurred losses in excess of coverage provided by our reinsurance program and the FHCF, and for losses that otherwise are not covered by the reinsurance program. If we are unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our exposure risk, reduce our insurance writings, seek rate adjustments at levels that might not be approved or might adversely affect policy retention, or develop or seek other alternatives, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nReinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nReinsurance does not legally discharge us from our primary liability for the full amount of the risk we insure, although it does make the reinsurer liable to us in the event of a claim. As such, we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. The collectability of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including (i) our reinsurers\u2019\nfinancial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract or (ii) whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions and are recoverable under our reinsurance contracts for covered events or are excluded. Further, if a reinsurer fails to pay an amount due to us within 90 days of such amount coming due, we are required by certain statutory accounting rules to account for a portion of this unpaid amount as a non-admitted asset, which would negatively impact our statutory surplus. Our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer, or to collect such recovery in a timely fashion, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, liquidity and surplus.\nOur financial condition and operating results are subject to the cyclical nature of the property and casualty insurance business.\nThe property and casualty insurance market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. As premium levels increase, and competitors perceive an increased opportunity for profitability, new entrants to the market or expansion by existing participants lead to increased competition, a reduction in premium rates, less favorable policy terms and fewer opportunities to underwrite insurance risks. These conditions can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. In addition to these considerations, changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and insurers, including changes resulting from multiple and/or catastrophic hurricanes, affect the cycles of the property and casualty insurance business significantly. Negative market conditions can impair our ability to write insurance at rates that we consider adequate and appropriate relative to the risk written. To the extent that we cannot write insurance at appropriate rates, our business would be materially and adversely affected. We cannot predict whether market conditions will improve, remain constant or deteriorate. An extended period of negative market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we conduct the majority of our business in Florida, our financial results depend on the regulatory, economic and weather conditions in Florida.\nThough we are licensed to transact insurance business in other states, we write a majority of our premium in Florida. Therefore, prevailing regulatory, consumer behavior, legal, economic, political, demographic, competitive, weather and other conditions in Florida disproportionately affect our revenues and profitability. Adverse changes in these conditions make doing business in Florida as opposed to other states less attractive for us and have a more pronounced effect on us than it would on other insurance companies that are more geographically diversified throughout the United States. Further, a single catastrophic event, or a series of such events, specifically affecting Florida, particularly in the more densely populated areas of the state, have had and could in the future have a disproportionately adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. This is particularly true in certain Florida counties where we write a high concentration of policies such that a catastrophic event, or series of catastrophic events, in these counties have had and could in the future have a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The fact that our business is concentrated in Florida subjects us to increased exposure to certain catastrophic events and destructive weather patterns such as hurricanes, tropical storms and tornadoes.\nChanging climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, profitability or cash flows.\nAlthough the incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely unpredictable, the frequency and severity of property claims generally increase when severe weather conditions occur. Longer-term weather trends may be changing, and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, including effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperature, sea levels, rain and snow. To the extent the frequency or severity of weather events is exacerbated due to climate change, we may experience increases in catastrophe losses in both coastal and non-coastal areas. This may cause an increase in claims-related and/or reinsurance costs or may negatively affect our ability to provide homeowners insurance to our policyholders in the future. Governmental entities may also respond to climate change by enacting laws and regulations that may adversely affect our cost of providing homeowners insurance in the future. In addition to the inherent uncertainties associated with studying, understanding and modeling changing climate conditions, available analyses and models in this area typically relate to potential meteorological or sea level impacts and generally are not intended to analyze or predict impacts on insured losses.\nWe have entered new markets and expect that we will continue to do so, but there can be no assurance that our diversification and growth strategy will be effective.\nWe seek to take advantage of prudent opportunities to expand our core business into other states where we believe the independent agent distribution channel is strong. As a result of a number of factors, including the difficulties of finding appropriate expansion opportunities and the challenges of operating in unfamiliar markets, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this diversification even after investing significant time and resources to develop and market products and services in additional states. Initial timetables for expansion may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not be feasible. Because our business and experience are based substantially on the Florida insurance market, we may not understand all of the risks associated with entering into an unfamiliar market. For example, the occurrence of significant winter storms in certain states we have expanded into has in some circumstances limited the effectiveness of our revenue and risk diversification strategy by decreasing revenue we expected to receive outside of the Florida hurricane season or increased our overall risk in ways we had not anticipated when entering those markets. This inexperience in certain new markets could affect our ability to price risks adequately and develop effective underwriting standards. External factors, such as compliance with state regulations,\nobtaining new licenses, competitive alternatives and shifting customer preferences, may also affect the successful implementation of our geographic growth strategy. Such external factors and requirements may increase our costs and potentially affect the speed with which we will be able to pursue new market opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in expanding into any one state or combination of states. Failure to manage these risks successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our operations.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees and on our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees. An absence of the leadership and performance of the executive management team or our inability to retain talented employees could significantly impact our future performance. Competition for these individuals is intense and our ability to operate successfully may be impaired if we are not effective in filling critical leadership positions, in developing the talent and skills of our human resources, in assimilating new executive talent into our organization, or in deploying human resource talent consistent with our business goals.\nWe could be adversely affected if our controls designed to ensure compliance with guidelines, policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective.\nOur business is highly dependent on the ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting, claims processing and investment activities, many of which are highly complex, must be performed expeditiously and involve opportunities for human judgment and errors. These activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies, as well as legal and regulatory standards. In addition, these legal and regulatory standards can be subject to varying interpretations. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Our failure to comply with these guidelines, policies or standards could lead to financial loss, unanticipated risk exposure, regulatory sanctions or penalties, civil or administrative litigation, or damage to our reputation.\nThe failure of our claims professionals to effectively manage claims could adversely affect our insurance business and financial results.\nWe rely primarily on our claims professionals to facilitate and oversee the claims adjustment process for our policyholders. Many factors affect the ability of our claims professionals to effectively manage claims by our policyholders, including:\n\u2022the accuracy of our adjusters as they make their assessments and submit their estimates of damages;\n\u2022the training, background and experience of our claims representatives;\n\u2022the ability of our claims professionals to ensure consistent claims handling;\n\u2022the ability of our claims professionals to translate the information provided by adjusters into acceptable claims resolutions; and\n\u2022the ability of our claims professionals to maintain and update our claims handling procedures and systems as they evolve over time based on claims and geographical trends in claims reporting as well as consumer behaviors affecting claims handling.\nAny failure to effectively manage the claims adjustment process, including failure to pay claims accurately and failure to oversee third-party claims adjusters, could lead to material litigation, regulatory penalties or sanctions, undermine our reputation in the marketplace and with our network of independent agents, impair our corporate image and negatively affect our financial results.\nLitigation or regulatory actions could result in material settlements, judgments, fines or penalties and consequently have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and reputation.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to civil or administrative actions and litigation. This is especially the case in Florida, where insurance companies, including the Insurance Entities, have experienced increases in first-party litigation due largely to the state\u2019s one-way attorneys\u2019 fee statute and resulting litigation climate. Although we strive to pay meritorious claims in a fair and prompt manner, civil litigation can result when we do not pay insurance claims in the amounts or at the times demanded by policyholders or their representatives. We also may be subject to litigation or administrative actions arising from the conduct of our business and the regulatory authority of state insurance departments. Further, we are subject to other types of litigation inherent in operating our businesses, employing personnel, contracting with vendors and otherwise carrying out our affairs. As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage have arisen and may in the future arise, including judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability, plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers in purported class-action litigation relating to claims-handling and other practices, and adverse changes in loss cost trends, including inflationary pressures in home repair costs or other legal or regulatory conditions incentivizing increases in disputed or litigated claims. Multiparty or class action claims present additional exposure to substantial economic, non-economic or punitive damage awards. Litigation or regulatory matters have negatively affected and may in the future negatively affect us by resulting in the payment of substantial awards or settlements, increasing legal and compliance costs, requiring us to change certain aspects of our business operations, diverting management attention from other business issues, harming our reputation with agents and customers or making it more difficult to retain current customers and to recruit and retain employees or agents.\nOur future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in a highly competitive insurance industry.\nThe property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive. We compete against large national carriers that have greater capital resources and longer operating histories, regional carriers and managing general agencies, as well as newly formed and less-capitalized companies that might have more aggressive underwriting or pricing strategies. Many of these entities may also be affiliated with other entities that have greater financial and other resources than we have. When competitors attempt to increase market share by lowering rates, we can experience reductions in our underwriting margins, or a decline in sales of our insurance policies as customers purchase lower-priced products from our competitors. Competitors also might adopt more prompt or more effective solutions to adverse market conditions than we are able to implement, providing those competitors with a competitive advantage through lower losses and loss adjustment expenses, more competitive premium levels, or the ability to expand their businesses. Because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry, including competition for producers such as independent agents, there can be no assurance that we will continue to develop and maintain productive relationships with independent agents, effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nA downgrade in our Financial Stability Rating\u00ae may have an adverse effect on our competitive position, the marketability of our product offerings, and our liquidity, operating results and financial condition.\nFinancial Stability Ratings\u00ae and similar ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an insurance company\u2019s business. On an ongoing basis, rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer\u2019s ratings due to, for example, a change in an insurer\u2019s statutory capital; a change in a rating agency\u2019s determination of the amount of risk-adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating; a change in the perceived adequacy of an insurer\u2019s reinsurance program; an increase in the perceived risk of an insurer\u2019s investment portfolio; a reduced confidence in management or a host of other considerations that may or may not be within an insurer\u2019s knowledge or control. Demotech has assigned a Financial Stability Rating\u00ae of A for each Insurance Entity. Because these ratings are subject to continuous review, the retention of these ratings cannot be assured. A downgrade in or withdrawal of these ratings, or a decision by Demotech to require us to make a capital infusion into the Insurance Entities to maintain their ratings, may adversely affect our liquidity, operating results and financial condition. In addition, our failure to maintain a financial strength rating acceptable in the secondary mortgage market would adversely affect our ability to write new and renewal business. Financial Stability Ratings\u00ae are primarily directed towards policyholders of the Insurance Entities, and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of our shareholders, and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities.\nBreaches of our information systems or denial of service on our website could have an adverse impact on our business and reputation.\nOur ability to effectively operate our business depends on our ability, and the ability of certain third-party vendors and business partners, to access our computer systems to perform necessary business functions, such as providing quotes and product pricing, billing and processing premiums, administering claims and reporting our financial results. Our business and operations rely on the secure and efficient processing, storage and transmission of customer and company data, including policyholders\u2019 nonpublic personal information, including financial information, and proprietary business information, on our computer systems and networks. Unauthorized access to personally identifiable information, even if not financial information, could be damaging to all affected parties. Breaches can involve attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to nonpublic personal information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, including through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means; breaches can also involve human error, such as employees falling victim to phishing schemes or computer coding errors that may inadvertently leave data exposed.\nOur computer systems are vulnerable to unauthorized access and hackers, computer viruses and other scenarios in which our data may be exposed or compromised. Cyberattacks can originate from a variety of sources, including third parties who are affiliated with foreign governments or employees acting negligently or in a manner adverse to our interests. Third parties may seek to gain access to our systems either directly or using equipment or security passwords belonging to employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of our systems. Our systems also may inadvertently expose, through a computer programming error or otherwise, confidential information as well as that of our customers and third parties with whom we interact.\nOur computer systems have been, and likely will continue to be, subject to cyber hacking activities, computer viruses, other malicious codes or other computer-related penetrations. To date, we are not aware of a material breach of cybersecurity. We commit significant resources to administrative and technical controls to prevent cyber incidents and protect our information technology, but our preventative actions to reduce the risk of cyber threats may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins and other cyberattacks or security breaches, including those due to human vulnerabilities. Any such event could damage our computers or systems; compromise our confidential information as well as that of our customers and third parties with whom we interact; significantly impede or interrupt business operations, including denial of service on our website; and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our policyholders, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and reputational harm, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. We expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities, exposures, or information security events. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems, the process of enhancing our protective measures can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues.\nThe increase in the use of cloud technologies and in consumer preference for online transactions can heighten these and other operational risks. Certain aspects of the security of such technologies are unpredictable or beyond our control, and this lack of transparency may inhibit our ability to discover a failure by cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyberattacks that could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential and other information. In addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures, despite their sophistication, may be defeated, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies vastly increase the speed and computing power available.\nIn addition, any significant data security breach of our independent agents or third-party vendors could harm our business and reputation.\nWe may not be able to effectively implement or adapt to changes in technology, which may result in interruptions to our business or a competitive disadvantage.\nDevelopments in technology are affecting the insurance business. We believe that the development and implementation of new technologies will require additional investment of our capital resources in the future, and it is possible that we may not be able to effectively implement or adapt to new technologies. We have not determined the amount of resources and the time that this development and implementation may require, which may result in short-term, unexpected interruptions to our business, or may result in a competitive disadvantage in price and/or efficiency, as we endeavor to develop or implement new technologies.\nLack of effectiveness of exclusions and other loss limitation methods in the insurance policies we write or changes in laws and/or potential regulatory approaches relating to them could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations.\nAll of the policies we issue include exclusions or other conditions that define and limit coverage. These exclusions and conditions are designed to manage our exposure to certain risk types or risk characteristics and expanding theories of legal liability. In addition, applicable law limits the time period during which a policyholder may bring a claim under the policy. It is possible that a regulatory authority would refuse to approve or a court could nullify or void an exclusion or limitation or interpret existing coverages more broadly than we anticipate, or that legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of these exclusions or limitations. This could result in higher than anticipated losses and LAE by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increasing the number or size of claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In some instances, the intended effects of approved policy language and court interpretation of the same may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued the insurance policies and case law sets a precedent for legal interpretation of them. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a policy is issued.\nRISKS RELATING TO INVESTMENTS\nWe are subject to market risk, which may adversely affect investment income.\nOur primary market risk exposures are changes in equity prices and interest rates, which impact our investment income and returns. Declines in market interest rates have an adverse effect on our investment income to the extent that we invest cash in new interest-bearing investments that yield less than our portfolio\u2019s average rate of return or purchase longer-term or riskier assets in order to obtain adequate investment yields resulting in a duration gap when compared to the duration of liabilities. Increases in market interest rates also have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio by decreasing the fair values of the available-for-sale debt securities that comprise a large portion of our investment portfolio. Similarly, declines in the equities markets adversely affect our existing portfolio. Increases in the equities markets might increase returns on our existing portfolio but reduce the attractiveness of future investments.\nOur overall financial performance depends in part on the returns on our investment portfolio.\nThe performance of our investment portfolio is independent of the revenue and income generated from our insurance operations, and there is typically no direct correlation between the financial results of these two activities. Thus, to the extent that our investment portfolio does not perform well due to the factors discussed above or otherwise, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected even if our insurance operations perform favorably. Further, because the returns on our investment portfolio are subject to market volatility, our overall results of operations could likewise be volatile from period to period even if we do not experience significant financial variances in our insurance operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth and profitability.\nThe laws and regulations affecting the insurance industry are complex and subject to change. Compliance with these laws and regulations may increase the costs of running our business and may even slow our ability to respond effectively and quickly to operational opportunities. Moreover, these laws and regulations are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities, including state insurance regulators, the U.S. Department of Justice, and state attorneys general, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude. Consequently, we are also subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator\u2019s or enforcement authority\u2019s interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another\u2019s\ninterpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. In addition, there is risk that any particular regulator\u2019s or enforcement authority\u2019s interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal environment may cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow and achieve or improve the profitability of our business. We also have been affected by, and in the future may continue to be affected by, decisions or inaction by state legislatures that result in the continuation or worsening of adverse market conditions. Furthermore, in some cases, laws and regulations are designed to protect or benefit the interests of a specific constituency rather than a range of constituencies. For example, state insurance laws and regulations are generally intended to protect or benefit purchasers or users of insurance products, and not shareholders. In many respects, these laws and regulations limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business or effectively respond to changing market conditions, and may place constraints on our ability to meet our revenue and net profit goals.\nThe Insurance Entities are highly regulated by state insurance authorities in Florida, the state in which each is domiciled, and UPCIC and APPCIC are also regulated by state insurance authorities in the other states in which they conduct business. Such regulations, among other things, require that certain transactions between the Insurance Entities and their affiliates must be fair and reasonable and require prior notice and non-disapproval of such transactions by the applicable state insurance authority. State regulations also limit the amount of dividends and other payments that can be made by the Insurance Entities without prior regulatory approval and impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments the Insurance Entities may make. Other state regulations require insurance companies to file insurance premium rate schedules and policy forms for review and approval, restrict our ability to cancel or non-renew policies and determine the accounting standards we use in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These regulations also affect many other aspects of the Insurance Entities\u2019 businesses. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance efforts and other expenses of doing business. If the Insurance Entities fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the regulatory agencies can revoke or suspend the Insurance Entities\u2019 licenses, withhold required approvals, require corrective action, impose operating limitations, impose penalties and fines or pursue other remedies available under applicable laws and regulations.\nState insurance regulatory agencies conduct periodic examinations of the Insurance Entities on a wide variety of matters, including policy forms, premium rates, licensing, trade and claims practices, investment standards and practices, statutory capital and surplus requirements, reserve and loss ratio requirements and transactions among affiliates. Further, the Insurance Entities are required to file quarterly, annual and other reports with state insurance regulatory agencies relating to financial condition, holding company issues and other matters.\nRegulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us. This could adversely affect our ability to operate our business both directly and potentially indirectly through reputational damage.\nState legislatures and insurance regulators regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, can be made for the benefit of the consumer, or for other reasons, at the direct or indirect expense of insurers, and thus could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In other instances, decisions by policymakers to not address adverse market conditions through effective changes to underlying statutes has caused, and in the future might continue to cause, an adverse effect on our financial conditions and results of operations.\nOver the course of many years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under public scrutiny and members of Congress have discussed proposals to provide for federal chartering of insurance companies. We can make no assurances regarding the potential impact of state or federal measures that may change the nature or scope of insurance regulation.\nUVE is a holding company and, consequently, its cash flow is dependent on dividends and other permissible payments from its subsidiaries.\nUVE is a holding company that conducts no insurance operations of its own. All operations are conducted by the Insurance Entities and by other operating subsidiaries, most of which support the business of the Insurance Entities. As a holding company, UVE\u2019s sources of cash flow consist primarily of dividends and other permissible payments from its subsidiaries. The ability of our non-insurance company subsidiaries to pay dividends may be adversely affected by reductions in the premiums or number of policies written by the Insurance Entities, by changes in the terms of the parties\u2019 contracts, or by changes in the regulation of insurance holding company systems. UVE depends on such payments for general corporate purposes, for its capital management activities and for payment of any dividends to its common shareholders. The ability of the Insurance Entities to make such payments is limited by applicable law, as set forth in \u201cItem 1 - Business-Government Regulation-Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions.\u201d For more details on our cash flows, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nRegulations limiting rate changes and requiring us to participate in loss sharing or assessments may decrease our profitability.\nFrom time to time, public policy preferences and perceptions affect the insurance market, including insurers\u2019 efforts to effectively maintain rates that allow us to reach targeted levels of rate adequacy and profitability. Despite efforts to address rate needs and other operational issues analytically, facts and history demonstrate that public policymakers, when faced with untoward events and adverse public sentiment, have acted and may in the future act in ways that impede our ability to maintain a satisfactory correlation between rates and risk. This has included, and in the future may include, policymakers\u2019 failures to take steps to address the causes of adverse market conditions. Such acts or failures to act may affect our ability to obtain approval for rate changes that we believe are necessary to attain rate adequacy along with targeted levels of profitability and returns on equity. Our ability to afford reinsurance required to reduce our catastrophe risk also depends in part on our ability to adjust rates for our costs.\nAdditionally, we are required to participate in guaranty funds for insolvent insurance companies and other statutory insurance entities. The guaranty funds and other statutory entities periodically levy assessments against all applicable insurance companies doing business in the state and the amounts and timing of those assessments are unpredictable. Although we seek to recoup these assessments from our policyholders, we might not be able to fully do so and at any point in time or for any period, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors.\nThe amount of statutory capital and surplus that each of the Insurance Entities has and the amount of statutory capital and surplus it must hold vary and are sensitive to a number of factors outside of our control, including market conditions and the regulatory environment and rules.\nThe Insurance Entities are subject to RBC standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under applicable state laws. The RBC standards, based upon the Risk-Based Capital Model Act adopted by the NAIC, require us to report our results of RBC calculations to the FLOIR and the NAIC. These RBC standards provide for different levels of regulatory attention depending upon the ratio of an insurance company\u2019s total adjusted capital, as calculated in accordance with NAIC guidelines, to its authorized control level RBC. Authorized control level RBC is determined using the NAIC\u2019s RBC formula, which measures the minimum amount of capital that an insurance company needs to support its overall business operations.\nAn insurance company with total adjusted capital that (i) is at less than 200% of its authorized control level RBC, or (ii) falls below 300% of its RBC requirement and also fails a trend test, is deemed to be at a \u201ccompany action level,\u201d which would require the insurance company to file a plan that, among other things, contains proposals of corrective actions the company intends to take that are reasonably expected to result in the elimination of the company action level event. Additional action level events occur when the insurer\u2019s total adjusted capital falls below 150%, 100%, and 70% of its authorized control level RBC. The lower the percentage, the more severe the regulatory response, including, in the event of a mandatory control level event (total adjusted capital falls below 70% of the insurer\u2019s authorized control level RBC), placing the insurance company into receivership.\nIn addition, the Insurance Entities are required to maintain certain minimum capital and surplus and to limit premiums written to specified multiples of capital and surplus. Our Insurance Entities could exceed these ratios if their volume increases faster than anticipated or if their surplus declines due to catastrophe or non-catastrophe losses or excessive underwriting and operational expenses.\nAny failure by the Insurance Entities to meet the applicable RBC or minimum statutory capital requirements imposed by the laws of Florida (or other states where we currently or may eventually conduct business) could subject them to further examination or corrective action imposed by state regulators, including limitations on our writing of additional business, state supervision or liquidation, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation and financial condition. Any such failure also could adversely affect our Financial Stability Ratings\u00ae.\nAny changes in existing RBC requirements, minimum statutory capital requirements, or applicable writings ratios may require us to increase our statutory capital levels, which we may be unable to do, or require us to reduce the amount of premiums we write, which could adversely affect our business and our operating results.", "PERMNO": 78211, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "UVE"}
