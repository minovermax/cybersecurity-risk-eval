Risk Factors\nIn addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business that are common to all businesses, important factors that are specific to us and our industry could materially impact our future performance and results of operations. We have provided below a list of known material risk factors that should be reviewed when considering buying or selling our securities. These are not all the risks we face and other factors currently considered immaterial or unknown to us may impact our future operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry, Our Business and Our Financial Condition\nFurther declines in crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices or an extended period of currently depressed prices will adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flow, liquidity or results of operations and our ability to meet our future capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments and to implement our business strategy.\nThe price we receive for our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas production directly affects our revenues, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Crude oil, NGLs and natural gas are commodities and are subject to wide price fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. The significantly reduced prices for our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas production in 2016 and 2015 have substantially decreased our revenues on a per unit basis and have also reduced the amount of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas that we can produce economically. Historically, the markets for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas have been volatile and will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production and the volume of our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in global supply and demand for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d);\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign crude oil, NGLs, natural gas and liquefied natural gas;\n\u2022\nacts of war, terrorism or political instability in oil producing countries;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions and events, including embargoes, affecting oil-producing activities;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activities;\n\u2022\nthe level of global crude oil, NGLs and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u2022\ngeographic differences in pricing.\nThe prices of crude oil, domestic natural gas and NGLs have declined substantially starting in the second half of 2014. The average price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate (\u201cWTI\u201d) crude oil was over $90.00 in 2014, approximately $49.00 in 2015 and approximately $43.00 per barrel in 2016. This decrease in prices has impacted all companies throughout the oil and gas industry. Natural gas and NGL prices have also been negatively affected by excess natural gas production, high levels of stored natural gas and weather conditions affecting demand. During 2014, the average Henry Hub spot price for natural gas was above $4.00 per MMBtu compared to approximately $2.60 per MMBtu during 2015 and approximately $2.50 per MMBtu in 2016. Development activities in shale and other resource plays have the potential to yield a significant amount of natural gas and NGLs production, as well as natural gas and NGLs produced in connection with domestic oil drilling activities. Although oil prices have increased somewhat from the lows of the first quarter of 2016, margins are still low compared to historical levels. An environment of continued low crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices would materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures, ability to fund our ARO, ability to repay any borrowings per our debt agreements, to secure supplemental bonding, to secure collateral for such bonding, if required, and to meet our other financial obligations.\nThe borrowing base under our Credit Agreement may be reduced by our lenders.\nAvailability of borrowings and letters of credit under the Credit Agreement is determined by establishment of a borrowing base, which is periodically redetermined during the year based on our lenders\u2019 view of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices and on our proved reserves. The borrowing base under the Credit Agreement was reduced during 2016, and was $150 million as of December 31, 2016 compared to $750 million as of December 31, 2014. The lower borrowing base was primarily due to declines in commodity prices. The borrowing base could be further reduced in the future as a result of the continued impact of low commodity prices, our lenders\u2019 outlook for future prices or our inability to replace reserves as a result of constrained capital spending. To the extent borrowings and letters of credit outstanding exceed the redetermined borrowing base; such excess or deficiency is required to be repaid within 90 days in three equal monthly payments. In addition to the borrowing base limitation, the Credit Agreement limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness if we cannot comply with specified financial covenants and ratios.\nWe may not have the financial resources in the future to repay an excess or deficiency resulting from a borrowing base redetermination as required under our Credit Agreement, which could result in an event of default. Additionally, a material reduction of our current cash position could substantially limit our ability to comply with other cash needs, such as collateral needs for existing or additional supplemental surety bonds or other financial assurances issued to BOEM for our decommissioning obligations. Further, the failure to repay an excess or deficiency that may result from a borrowing base redetermination under our Credit Agreement may result in a cross-default under our other debt agreements. Continued low crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices in the future would continue to adversely affect our cash flow, which could result in further reductions in our borrowing base, adversely affect prospects for alternative credit availability or affect our ability to satisfy our covenants and ratios under our Credit Agreement.\nWe may be unable to provide the financial assurances demanded by the BOEM to cover our decommissioning obligations in the amounts and under the time periods required by the BOEM. If extensions and modifications to the BOEM\u2019s current or future demands are needed and cannot be obtained, the BOEM could elect to take actions that would materially adversely impact our operations and our properties, including commencing proceedings to suspend our operations or cancel our federal offshore leases.\nThe BOEM requires that lessees demonstrate financial strength and reliability according to its regulations or provide acceptable financial assurances to assure satisfaction of lease obligations, including decommissioning activities on the OCS. In July 2016, the BOEM issued NTL #2016-N01 to clarify the procedures and guidelines that BOEM Regional Directors use to determine if and when additional financial assurances may be required for OCS leases, ROWs or RUEs. This NTL became effective in September 2016 and supersedes and replaces NTL #2008-N07. In January 2017, the BOEM issued the January 2017 Extension for non-sole liability properties. During 2016 and in January and February 2017, we received notices from the BOEM concerning financial assurances of our decommissioning obligations, which are summarized below.\n\u2022\nIn the first quarter of 2016, we received several orders from the BOEM demanding the Company to secure financial assurances in the aggregate of $260.8 million, with amounts specified with respect to certain designated leases, ROWs and RUEs. We filed various appeals to the Interior Board of Land Appeals (the \u201cIBLA\u201d) under the Department of the Interior concerning these orders. The IBLA, acknowledging the BOEM and the Company were seeking to resolve the BOEM demands through settlement discussions, stayed the effectiveness of these orders several times, with the current stay effective to May 31, 2017.\n\u2022\nIn September 2016, we received notice from the BOEM confirming that we do not qualify to self-insure a portion of any additional financial assurance under NTL #2016-N01.\n\u2022\nIn October 2016, we received from the BOEM proposal letters outlining what additional security the BOEM proposes to require for leases, ROWs and RUEs in which we are designated operator.\n\u2022\nIn December 2016, the BOEM issued to us an Order to Provide Additional Security for our sole liability properties. Sole liability properties are leases, ROWs or RUEs for which the holder is the only liable party, i.e., there are no co-lessees, operating rights owners and/or other grant holders, and no prior interest holders liable to meet the lease and/or grant obligations.\n\u2022\nIn January 2017, the BOEM, in a notice to stakeholders, issued the January 2017 Extension which extended the implementation timeline for NTL #2016-N01 by an additional six months as to non-sole liability leases, ROWs and RUEs, except in circumstances in which the BOEM determines there is a substantial risk of nonperformance of the interest holder\u2019s decommissioning liabilities. The extension does not affect the demand to provide financial assurance for leases, ROWs and RUEs constituting sole liability properties. The BOEM stated that the extension was needed to provide the BOEM and industry the opportunity to focus on providing additional security for sole liability properties, and to allow an opportunity for additional time and conversation concerning the non-sole liability properties.\n\u2022\nIn February 2017, the BOEM withdrew the orders it issued in December 2016 affecting so called \u201csole liability properties\u201d to allow time for the new President\u2019s administration to review the complex financial assurance program. This withdrawal rescinded the Order to Provide Additional Security issued to us in December 2016. However, the BOEM may re-issue sole liability orders before the end of the six-month period if it determines there is a substantial risk of nonperformance of the interest holder\u2019s decommissioning liabilities.\nAs suggested by the BOEM in its January and February notices to stakeholders, we intend to use the six month extension granted by the BOEM as an opportunity to propose and negotiate acceptable plans dealing with both sole and non-sole liability properties.\nWhile we expect to be able address the financial assurances of our sole and non-sole liability properties in accordance with the guidelines under NTL #2016-N01, we cannot provide any assurance at this time on when the BOEM will direct that such financial assurance coverage must be submitted or how to structure such coverage, and if we are able to fund such coverage. We could in the future receive further or revised demands from the BOEM for additional financial assurances covering our obligations under sole liability properties and/or our non-sole liability properties. The BOEM may reject our proposals and make demands that exceed the Company\u2019s capabilities.\nIf we fail to comply with the current or future orders of the BOEM to provide additional surety bonds or other financial assurances, the BOEM could commence enforcement proceedings or take other remedial action, including assessing civil penalties, suspending operations or production, or initiating procedures to cancel leases, which, if upheld, would have a material adverse effect on our business, properties, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be required to post cash collateral pursuant to our agreements with sureties under our existing bonding arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to execute our capital expenditure plan, our ARO plan and comply with our existing debt instruments.\nPursuant to the terms of our agreements with various sureties under our existing bonding arrangements or under any additional bonding arrangements we may enter into, we may be required to post collateral at any time, on demand, at the surety\u2019s discretion. We have received such demands and have provided collateral to a couple of our existing sureties. If additional collateral is required to support surety bond obligations, this collateral would probably be in the form of cash or letters of credit. Given current commodity prices\u2019 effect on our creditworthiness and the willingness of the surety to post bonds without the requisite collateral, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to satisfy collateral demands for current bonds or for additional bonds.\nIf we are required to provide collateral, our liquidity position will be negatively impacted and may require us to seek alternative financing. To the extent we are unable to secure adequate financing; we may be forced to reduce our capital expenditures in the current year and/or future years. In addition, a reduction in our liquidity may impair our ability to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness. Moreover, if we default on our Credit Agreement, then we would need a waiver or amendment from our bank lenders to prevent the acceleration of the outstanding debt under our Credit Agreement. There is no assurance that the bank lenders will waive or amend the Credit Agreement. Realization of any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. Our leverage and debt service obligations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects, and we may have difficulty paying our debts as they become due.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.0 billion recorded as debt, which includes $189.8 million principal amount of unsecured indebtedness and $683.9 million principal amount of secured indebtedness outstanding and less than $1 million in outstanding letters of credit. Our current availability on our revolving bank credit facility is approximately $150 million and we had no borrowings outstanding on our revolving bank credit facility. For example, our leverage could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to fund future working capital requirements, capital expenditures and ARO, to engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets;\n\u2022\nlimit our opportunities because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments of interest and principal on our debt obligations or to comply with any restrictive terms of our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nAny of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur ability to pay our expenses and fund our working capital needs and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as commodity prices, other economic conditions and governmental regulation. Substantially all of our oil, NGLs and natural gas properties are pledged as collateral under our Credit Agreement and also pledged as collateral on a subordinate basis under certain other debt agreements. Sustained or lower crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices in the future will continue to adversely affect our cash flow and could result in further reductions in our borrowing base, reduce prospects for alternate credit availability, and affect our ability to satisfy the covenants and ratios under our Credit Agreement. Further asset sales may also reduce available collateral and availability under our Credit Agreement. In addition, we cannot be certain that our cash flow will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations.\nIf we are unable to service our indebtedness and other obligations, we may be required to further restructure or refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, borrow more money or raise equity. We may not be able to further restructure or refinance our debt, reduce capital expenditures, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all, or such alternative strategies may yield insufficient funds to make required payments on our indebtedness. In addition, our ability to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness is uncertain and will be affected by our future performance and events or circumstances beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants would result in an event of default under such indebtedness, the potential acceleration of our obligation to repay outstanding debt and the potential foreclosure on the collateral securing such debt, and could cause a cross-default under our other outstanding indebtedness. Any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could lead to a restructuring.\nWe may be able to incur substantially more debt. This could exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the terms of our debt agreements. As of December 31, 2016, we had $189.8 million of unsecured indebtedness and approximately $683.9 million of secured indebtedness outstanding (excluding $0.5 million of letters of credit and amounts included in the carrying value of certain debt for future payment-in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) and cash interest payments). The components of our indebtedness are:\n\u2022\n$0.5 million of letters of credit;\n\u2022\n$75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.5 Lien Term Loan;\n\u2022\n$300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 9.00% Term Loan, due May 2020 (the \u201cSecond Lien Term Loan\u201d);\n\u2022\n$163.0 million of Second Lien PIK Toggle Notes;\n\u2022\n$145.9 million of Third Lien PIK Toggle Notes; and\n\u2022\n$189.8 million in aggregate principal amount of the Unsecured Senior Notes.\nIf new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries face could intensify. Our level of indebtedness may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us by limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, limiting our flexibility in operating our business or otherwise. In addition, we could be at a competitive disadvantage against other less leveraged competitors that have more cash flow to devote to their business.\nRestrictions in our existing and future debt agreements could limit our growth and our ability to respond to changing conditions.\nThe indentures and credit agreements governing our indebtedness contain a number of significant restrictive covenants in addition to covenants restricting the incurrence of additional debt. These covenants limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;\n\u2022\ncreate certain liens;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries to us;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of our company;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022\nmaintain certain cash balances;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or subordinated indebtedness; and\n\u2022\ncreate unrestricted subsidiaries.\nOur revolving bank credit facility requires us, among other things, to maintain certain financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests or reduce our debt. These restrictions may also limit our ability to obtain future financings, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us from the restrictive covenants under our indentures governing our other debt instruments.\nA breach of any covenant in the agreements governing our debt would result in a default under such agreement after any applicable grace periods. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the debt outstanding under such agreement and in a default with respect to, and acceleration of, the debt outstanding under any other debt agreements. The accelerated debt would become immediately due and payable. If that should occur, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such accelerated debt. Even if new financing were then available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\nWe may not be able to extend, renew, refund, defease, discharge, replace or refinance our Unsecured Senior Notes by February 28, 2019.\nThe maturity of the Third Lien PIK Toggle Notes and the 1.5 Lien Term Loan will accelerate to February 28, 2019 if the remaining Unsecured Senior Notes are not extended, renewed, refunded, defeased, discharged, replaced or refinanced by February 28, 2019. Assuming the PIK option is fully utilized for the Third Lien PIK Toggle Notes; the principal balance would grow and would be approximately $172.7 million as of February 28, 2019. For the 1.5 Lien Term Loan, no PIK option is available and the principal of $75.0 million would be unchanged as of February 28, 2019. Thus, a total of $247.7 million may become due on February 28, 2019. We may not have available funds to make these payments, which may cause us to be in default if we are unable to refinance the Unsecured Senior Notes before then. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the debt outstanding under such agreement and in a default with respect to, and acceleration of, the debt outstanding under any other debt agreements. The accelerated debt would become immediately due and payable. If that should occur, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such accelerated debt. Even if new financing were then available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\nWe may be unable to access the equity or debt capital markets to meet our obligations.\nSustained or lower crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices will adversely affect our cash flow and may lead to further reductions in the borrowing base, which could also lead to reduced prospects for alternate credit availability. The capital markets we have historically accessed as an alternative source of equity and debt capital are currently very constrained. Other capital sources may arise with significantly different terms and conditions. These limitations in the capital markets may affect our ability to grow and limit our ability to replace our reserves of oil and gas.\nOur plans for growth may include accessing the capital and credit markets. If the debt or equity capital markets do not improve, or if we are unable to access alternative means of financing on acceptable terms, we may be unable to implement all of our drilling and development plans, make acquisitions or otherwise carry out our business strategy, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our indebtedness.\nIf we default on our secured debt, the value of the collateral securing our secured debt may not be sufficient to ensure repayment of all of such debt.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had secured debt outstanding of $836.7 million which includes the outstanding principal, PIK and accrued interest and certain letter of credit reimbursement obligations. If in the future we default on one or more issues or tranches of our secured debt, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from the sale of the collateral will be sufficient to repay all of our secured debt in full. In addition, we have certain rights to issue or incur additional secured debt, including up to $149.5 million as of December 31, 2016, available for borrowing on our revolving bank credit facility, that would be secured by additional liens on the collateral and an issuance or incurrence of such additional secured debt would dilute the value of the collateral securing our outstanding secured debt. If the proceeds of any sale of the collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due in respect of our secured debt, then claims against our remaining assets to repay any amounts still outstanding under our secured obligations would be unsecured and our ability to pay our other unsecured obligations and any distributions in respect of our capital stock would be significantly impaired.\nThe collateral securing the various issues of our secured debt has not been appraised. The value of the collateral at any time will depend on market and other economic conditions, including the availability of suitable buyers for the collateral. The value of the assets pledged as collateral for our secured debt could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, commodity prices, competition or other future trends. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the pledged assets will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in their liquidation.\nIn addition, to the extent that third parties hold prior liens, such third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such liens that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the collateral securing our secured debt.\nWith respect to some of the collateral securing our secured debt, any collateral trustee\u2019s security interest and ability to foreclose on the collateral will also be limited by the need to meet certain requirements, such as obtaining third party consents, paying court fees that may be based on the principal amount of the parity lien obligations and making additional filings. If we are unable to obtain these consents, pay such fees or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the applicable holders and lenders will not be entitled to the collateral or any recovery with respect thereto. We cannot assure you that any such required consents, fee payments or filings can be obtained on a timely basis or at all. These requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain collateral in any foreclosure and may delay any sale, either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the collateral. Therefore, the practical aspect of realizing value from the collateral may, without the appropriate consents, fees and filings, be limited.\nIf crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices decrease from their current levels, we may be required to further write down the carrying values and/or the estimates of total reserves of our oil and natural gas properties.\nAccounting rules applicable to us require that we review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties quarterly for possible impairment. Impairment of proved properties under our full cost oil and gas accounting method is largely driven by the present value of future net revenues of proved reserves estimated using SEC mandated 12-month unweighted first-day-of-the-month commodity prices. In addition to commodity prices, impairment assessments of proved properties include the evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors. As crude oil, natural gas and NGLs prices declined in 2015, we incurred impairment charges in each quarter in 2015 totaling $987 million for the year. Such write-downs constitute a non-cash charge to earnings. As prices fell further during 2016, we incurred impairment charges in the first three quarters of 2016 which totaled $279 million. If prices fall below levels received during 2016, this would impact our estimated future revenues. In addition, lower crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices may reduce our estimates of the reserve volumes that may be economically recovered, which would reduce the total value of our proved reserves.\nNo assurance can be given that we will not experience additional ceiling test impairments in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods taken. Also, no assurance can be given that commodity price decreases will not affect our reserve volumes. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview and Critical Accounting Policies - Impairment of oil and natural gas properties under Part II, Item 7 and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information on the ceiling test.\nWe may be limited in our ability to maintain proved undeveloped reserves under current SEC guidance.\nCurrent SEC guidance requires proved undeveloped reserves (\u201cPUDs\u201d) may only be classified as such if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are reasonably certain to be drilled within five years of the date of booking. This rule may limit our potential to book additional PUDs as we pursue our drilling program. If current prices decline, we also may be compelled to postpone the drilling of PUDs until prices recover. If we postpone drilling of PUDs beyond this five-year development horizon, we may have to write off reserves previously recognized as proved undeveloped. In addition, if we are unable to demonstrate funding sources for our development plan with reasonable certainty, we may have to write-off all or a portion of our PUDs.\nOur PUDs comprised 13% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 and require additional future expenditures and/or activities to convert these into producing reserves. As circumstances change, we cannot provide assurance that all future expenditures will be made and that activities will be entirely successful in converting these reserves. Although we are the operator for all the fields containing our PUDs as of December 31, 2016, in the past, we were not the operator for a portion of our PUDs, which could have put us in a position of not being able to control the timing of development activities. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that all of our PUDs will ultimately be produced during the time periods we have planned, at the costs we have budgeted, or at all, which could result in the write-off of previously recognized reserves.\nRelatively short production periods for our Gulf of Mexico properties subject us to high reserve replacement needs and require significant capital expenditures to replace our reserves at a faster rate than companies whose reserves have longer production periods. Our failure to replace those reserves would result in decreasing reserves, production and cash flows over time.\nUnless we conduct successful development and exploration activities at sufficient levels or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing oil and natural gas reserves are generally characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. High production rates generally result in recovery of a relatively higher percentage of reserves during the initial few years of production. All of our current production is from the Gulf of Mexico. Reserves in the Gulf of Mexico generally decline more rapidly than from reserves in many other producing regions of the United States. Our independent petroleum consultant estimates that 55% of our total proved reserves will be depleted within three years. As a result, our need to replace reserves and production from new investments is relatively greater than that of producers who recover lower percentages of their reserves over a similar time period, such as those producers who have a larger portion of their reserves in areas other than the Gulf of Mexico. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves in sufficient quantities to sustain our current production levels or to grow production beyond current levels. In addition, due to the significant time requirements involved with exploration and development activities, particularly for wells in the deepwater or wells not located near existing infrastructure, actual oil and natural gas production from new wells may not occur, if at all, for a considerable period of time following the commencement of any particular project.\nSignificant capital expenditures are required to replace our reserves. If we are not able to replace reserves, we will not be able to sustain production at current levels.\nOur future success depends largely upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful exploration, development or acquisition activities, our proved reserves and production will decline over time. Our exploration, development and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures and acquisitions with cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, securities offerings and bank borrowings. The capital markets we have historically accessed are currently constrained and we believe our access to capital markets remains limited at this time. Compared to prior years, we significantly reduced our capital expenditures in 2016 and continue to have a low capital expenditure budget for 2017 in order to conserve capital and target projects with the highest probability of acceptable returns. Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, the prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas, and our success in developing and producing new reserves. Any reductions in our capital expenditures to stay within internally generated cash flow (which could be adversely affected by declining commodity prices) and cash on hand will make replacing produced reserves more difficult. These limitations in the capital markets and our recently constrained capital budget may adversely affect our ability to sustain our production at 2016 levels. We cannot be certain that financing for future capital expenditures will be available if needed, and to the extent required, on acceptable terms. For additional financing risks, see \u201c-Risks Relating to Our Industry, Our Business and Our Financial Condition.\u201d\nAdditional deepwater drilling laws, regulations and other restrictions, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, oil spill-response and decommissioning plans, and other related developments in the Gulf of Mexico may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn recent years, we have expanded our drilling efforts on deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico. The BSEE and the BOEM have imposed new and more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters. Compliance with these added and more stringent regulatory requirements and with existing environmental and spill regulations, together with uncertainties or inconsistencies in decisions and rulings by governmental agencies and delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, oil spill-response, and decommissioning plans and possible additional regulatory initiatives could result in difficult and more costly actions and adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts. Moreover, these governmental agencies are continuing to evaluate aspects of safety and operational performance in the Gulf of Mexico and, as a result, are continuing to develop and implement new, more restrictive requirements. For example, in April 2016, the BSEE published a final rule on well control that, among other things, imposes rigorous standards relating to the design, operation and maintenance of blow-out preventers, real-time monitoring of deepwater and high temperature, high pressure drilling activities, and enhanced reporting requirements. Also, in April 2016, the BOEM published a proposed rule that would update existing air emissions requirements relating to offshore oil and natural gas activity on the OCS. The BOEM regulates these air emissions in connection with its review of exploration and development plans, and ROWs and RUEs applications. The proposed rule would bolster existing air emissions requirements by, among other things, requiring the reporting and tracking of the emissions of all pollutants defined by the EPA to affect human health and public welfare. These rules and other potential subsequent rulemakings could further restrict offshore air emissions.\nAmong other adverse impacts, these additional measures could delay operations, disrupt our operations or increase the risk of leases expiring before exploration and development efforts have been completed due to the time required to develop new technology. This would result in increased financial assurance requirements and incurrence of associated added costs, limit operational activities in certain areas, or cause us to incur penalties or shut-in production at one or more of our facilities. If material spill incidents were to occur in the future, the United States or other countries where such an event may occur could elect to issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and natural gas exploration and development, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict with any certainty the full impact of any new laws or regulations on our drilling operations or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover some or all of the risks associated with such operations.\nLosses and liabilities from uninsured or underinsured drilling and operating activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nWe are and could be exposed to uninsured losses in the future. As of December 31, 2016, we carry named windstorm coverage of $150 million for a total loss only (\u201cTLO\u201d) on our Ship Shoal 349 (Mahogany) platform and do not have named wind storm coverage on any other of our properties. We currently carry insurance coverage for certain events besides the named windstorm coverage for Mahogany in our Energy Package (defined as certain insurance policies relating to our oil and gas properties which includes named windstorm TLO coverage for Mahogany). Along with having exposure for named wind storms at all of our properties, and limited coverage at our Mahogany property, we have additional exposure due to retention amounts within the Energy Package and limitations of the policies.\nThe occurrence of a significant accident or other event not covered in whole or in part by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operations. Our insurance does not protect us against all operational risks. We do not carry business interruption insurance. In May and June 2016, we entered into our insurance policies covering well control, hurricane damage, general liability and pollution. These policies reduce, but in no way totally mitigate our risk as we are exposed to amounts for retention and co-insurance, limits on coverage and events that are not insured. These policies expire in May and June 2017. Renewal of these policies at a cost commensurate with current premiums is not assured. We also have other smaller per-occurrence retention amounts for various other events. In addition, pollution and environmental risks are generally not fully insurable, as gradual seepage and pollution are not covered under our policies. Because third-party drilling contractors are used to drill our wells, we may not realize the full benefit of workmen\u2019s compensation laws in dealing with their employees.\nOPA requires owners and operators of offshore oil production facilities to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility to cover costs that could be incurred in responding to an oil spill. We are currently required to demonstrate, on an annual basis, that we have ready access to $150 million that can be used to respond to an oil spill from our facilities on the OCS. If OPA is amended to increase the minimum level of financial responsibility, we may experience difficulty in providing financial assurances sufficient to comply with this requirement. We cannot predict at this time whether OPA will be amended, or whether the level of financial responsibility required for companies operating on the OCS will be increased. In any event, if an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge were to occur, we may be liable for costs and damages, which costs and liabilities could be material to our results of operations and financial position.\nFor some risks, we have not obtained insurance as we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. We may take on further risks in the future if we believe the cost is excessive to the risks. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Hurricane Remediation, Insurance Claims and Insurance Coverage under Part II, Item 7 in this Form 10-K for additional information on insurance coverage.\nInsurance for well control and hurricane damage may become significantly more expensive for less coverage and some losses currently covered by insurance may not be covered in the future.\nIn the past, hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico have caused catastrophic losses and property damage. Well control insurance coverage has become more limited and the cost of such coverage has become both more costly and more volatile over the past five years. The insurance market may further change dramatically in the future due to hurricane damage, major oil spills or other events.\nIn the future, our insurers may not continue to offer what we view as reasonable coverage, or our costs may increase substantially as a result of increased premiums. There could be an increased risk of uninsured losses that may have been previously insured. We are also exposed to the possibility that in the future we will be unable to buy insurance at any price or that if we do have claims, the insurance companies will not pay our claims. The occurrence of any or all of these possibilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCommodity derivative positions may limit our potential gains.\nIn order to manage our exposure to price risk in the marketing of our oil and natural gas, we periodically enter into oil and natural gas price commodity derivative positions with respect to a portion of our expected production. As of December 31, 2016, we did not have any open commodity derivative positions. During the first quarter of 2017, we entered into commodity derivative contracts and may enter into more contracts in the future. While these commodity derivative positions are intended to reduce the effects of volatile crude oil and natural gas prices, they may also limit future income if crude oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by such positions. In addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u2022\nour production is less than expected;\n\u2022\nthere is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery points assumed in the hedge arrangements; or\n\u2022\nthe counterparties to the derivative contracts fail to perform under the terms of the contracts.\nSee Financial Statements and Supplementary Data- Note 8 - Derivative Financial Instruments under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information on derivative transactions.\nCompetition for oil and natural gas properties and prospects is intense; some of our competitors have larger financial, technical and personnel resources that may give them an advantage in evaluating and obtaining properties and prospects.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for reviewing prospects, acquiring properties, marketing oil, NGLs and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Many of our competitors have financial resources that allow them to obtain substantially greater technical expertise and personnel than we have. We actively compete with other companies in our industry when acquiring new leases or oil and natural gas properties. For example, new leases acquired from the BOEM are acquired through a \u201csealed bid\u201d process and are generally awarded to the highest bidder. Our competitors may be able to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our competitors may also be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects than we are able or willing to pay or finance. On the acquisition opportunities made available to us, we compete with other companies in our industry for such properties through a private bidding process, direct negotiations or some combination thereof. Our competitors may have significantly more capital resources and less expensive sources of capital. In addition, they may be able to generate acceptable rates of return from marginal prospects due to their lower costs of capital. If we are unable to compete successfully in these areas in the future, our future revenues and growth may be diminished or restricted. The availability of properties for acquisition depends largely on the divesting practices of other oil and natural gas companies, commodity prices, general economic conditions and other factors we cannot control or influence. Additional requirements and limitations recently imposed on us and our ability to finance such acquisitions may put us at a competitive disadvantage for acquiring properties. These risks are described above in the risk factor entitled: We may be unable to provide the financial assurances demanded by the BOEM to cover our decommissioning obligations in the amounts and under the time periods required by the BOEM. If extensions and modifications to the BOEM\u2019s current or future demands are needed and cannot be obtained, the BOEM could elect to take actions that would materially adversely impact our operations and our properties, including commencing proceedings to suspend our operations or cancel our federal offshore leases.\nWe conduct exploration, development and production operations on the deep shelf and in the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico, which presents unique operating risks.\nThe deep shelf and the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico are areas that have had less drilling activity due, in part, to their geological complexity, depth and higher cost to drill and ultimately develop. There are additional risks associated with deep shelf and deepwater drilling that could result in substantial cost overruns and/or result in uneconomic projects or wells. Deeper targets are more difficult to interpret with traditional seismic processing. Moreover, drilling costs and the risk of mechanical failure are significantly higher because of the additional depth and adverse conditions, such as high temperature and pressure. For example, the drilling of deepwater wells requires specific types of rigs with significantly higher day rates, as compared to the rigs used in shallower water. Deepwater wells have greater mechanical risks because the wellhead equipment is installed on the sea floor. Deepwater development costs can be significantly higher than development costs for wells drilled on the conventional shelf because deepwater drilling requires larger installation equipment, sophisticated sea floor production handling equipment, expensive state-of-the-art platforms and infrastructure investments. Deep shelf development can also be more expensive than conventional shelf projects because deep shelf development requires more drilling days and higher drilling and service costs due to extreme pressure and temperatures associated with greater depths. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our oil and natural gas exploration activities in the deep shelf, the deepwater and elsewhere will be commercially successful.\nOur estimates of future ARO may vary significantly from period to period and are especially significant because our operations are concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico.\nWe are required to record a liability for the present value of our ARO to plug and abandon inactive non-producing wells, to remove inactive or damaged platforms, facilities and equipment, and to restore the land or seabed at the end of oil and natural gas production operations. These costs are typically considerably more expensive for offshore operations as compared to most land-based operations due to increased regulatory scrutiny and the logistical issues associated with working in waters of various depths. Estimating future restoration and removal costs in the Gulf of Mexico is especially difficult because most of the removal obligations may be many years in the future, regulatory requirements are subject to change or such requirements may be interpreted more restrictively, and asset removal technologies are constantly evolving, which may result in additional or increased costs. As a result, we may make significant increases or decreases to our estimated ARO in future periods. For example, because we operate in the Gulf of Mexico, platforms, facilities and equipment are subject to damage or destruction as a result of hurricanes. The estimated cost to plug and abandon a well or dismantle a platform can change dramatically if the host platform from which the work was anticipated to be performed is damaged or toppled rather than structurally intact. Accordingly, our estimate of future ARO will differ dramatically from our recorded estimate if we have a damaged platform.\nDuring 2016, the additional requirements under the BOEM\u2019s NTL #2016-N01, once fully implemented, will increase the costs of our operations and reduce the availability of surety bonds due to the increased demands for such bonds in a low-price commodity environment. In December 2016, the BOEM issued an order on our sole liability properties for additional financial assurances. In January 2017, in a notice to stakeholders, the BOEM issued the January 2017 Extension, which extended the implementation timeline for providing financial assurance under NTL #2016-N01 by an additional six months for non-sole liability properties with certain exceptions. In February 2017, the BOEM withdrew the orders it issued in December 2016 affecting sole liability properties to allow time for the new Administration to review the complex financial assurance program. This withdrawal rescinded the Order to Provide Additional Security issued to us in December 2016. However, the BOEM may re-issue sole liability orders before the end of the six-month period if it determines there is a substantial risk of nonperformance of the interest holder\u2019s decommissioning liabilities. The BOEM\u2019s NTL #2016-N01 has given broader interpretation authority to BOEM\u2019s district personnel, which increases the difficulty in compliance with the new NTL. In addition, increased demand for salvage contractors and equipment could result in increased costs for plugging and abandonment operations. These items have, and may further increase our costs and may impact our liquidity adversely.\nWe may be obligated to pay costs related to other companies that have filed for bankruptcy or have indicated they are unable to pay their share of costs in joint ownership arrangements.\nIn our contractual arrangements of joint ownership of oil and gas interests with other companies, we are obligated to pay our share of operating, capital and decommission costs, and have the right to a share of revenues after royalties and certain other cash inflows. If one of the companies in the arrangement is unable to pay its agreed upon share of costs, generally the other companies in the arrangement are obligated to pay the non-paying company\u2019s obligations. Under joint operating agreements (\u201cJOAs\u201d) among working interest owners, the non-paying company would typically lose the right to future revenues, which would be applied to the non-paying company\u2019s share of operating, capital and decommissioning costs. If future revenues are insufficient to defray these additional costs, especially in cases where the well has stopped producing and is being decommissioned, we could be obligated to pay certain costs of the defaulting party. In addition, the liability to the U.S. Government for obligations of lessees under federal oil and gas leases, including obligations for decommissioning costs, is generally joint and several among the various co-owners of the lease, which means that any single owner may be liable to the U.S. Government for the full amount of all lessees\u2019 obligations under the lease. In certain circumstances, we also could be liable for decommissioning liabilities on federal oil and gas leases that we previously owned and the assignee is bankrupt or unable to pay its decommissioning costs. For example, we have in the past received a demand for payment of such costs related to property interests that were sold several years prior. These indirect obligations would affect our costs, operating profits and cash flows negatively and could be substantial.\nWe may not be in a position to control the timing of development efforts, associated costs or the rate of production of the reserves from our non-operated properties.\nAs we carry out our drilling program, we may not serve as operator of all planned wells. We have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of some non-operated properties and their associated costs. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs of properties operated by others could prevent the realization of anticipated results in drilling or acquisition activities. The success and timing of exploration and development activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe availability of suitable offshore drilling rigs, drilling equipment, support vessels, production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel;\n\u2022\nthe operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources;\n\u2022\napproval of other participants in drilling wells and such participants\u2019 financial resources;\n\u2022\nselection of technology; and\n\u2022\nthe rate of production of the reserves.\nOur business involves many uncertainties and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses.\nOur development activities may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including adverse weather conditions, cost overruns, equipment shortages, geological issues, technical difficulties and mechanical difficulties. Moreover, the successful drilling of a natural gas or oil well does not assure us that we will realize a profit on our investment. A variety of factors, both geological and market-related, can cause a well to become uneconomical or only marginally economical. In addition to their costs, unsuccessful wells hinder our efforts to replace reserves.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, including well stimulation and completion activities, involve a variety of operating risks, including:\n\u2022\nfires;\n\u2022\nexplosions;\n\u2022\nblow-outs and surface cratering;\n\u2022\nuncontrollable flows of natural gas, oil and formation water;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, such as tropical storms, hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain insurance at reasonable rates;\n\u2022\nfailure to receive payment on insurance claims in a timely manner, or for the full amount claimed;\n\u2022\npipe, cement, subsea well or pipeline failures;\n\u2022\ncasing collapses or failures;\n\u2022\nmechanical difficulties, such as lost or stuck oil field drilling and service tools;\n\u2022\nabnormally pressured formations or rock compaction; and\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline ruptures, encountering NORM, and discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases, or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment.\nIf we experience any of these problems, well bores, platforms, gathering systems and processing facilities could be affected, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations. We could also incur substantial losses as a result of:\n\u2022\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u2022\ndamage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022\npollution and other environmental damage;\n\u2022\nclean-up responsibilities;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigation and penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspension of our operations;\n\u2022\nrepairs required to resume operations; and\n\u2022\nloss of reserves.\nOffshore operations are also subject to a variety of operating risks related to the marine environment, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from tropical storms, hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production. Companies that incur environmental liabilities frequently also confront third-party claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment from a polluted site. Despite the \u201cpetroleum exclusion\u201d of Section 101(14) of CERCLA, which currently encompasses crude oil and natural gas, we may nonetheless handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. We may have liability for releases of hazardous substances at our properties by prior owners, operators, other third parties, or at properties we have sold. As a result, we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate funds available for exploration, development and acquisitions or result in the loss of property and equipment.\nThe geographic concentration of our properties in the Gulf of Mexico subjects us to an increased risk of loss of revenues or curtailment of production from factors specifically affecting the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe geographic concentration of our properties along the U.S. Gulf Coast and adjacent waters on and beyond the OCS means that some or all of our properties could be affected by the same event should the Gulf of Mexico experience:\n\u2022\nsevere weather, including tropical storms and hurricanes;\n\u2022\ndelays or decreases in production, the availability of equipment, facilities or services;\n\u2022\nchanges in the status of pipelines that we depend on for transportation of our production to the marketplace;\n\u2022\ndelays or decreases in the availability of capacity to transport, gather or process production; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment.\nBecause a majority of our properties could experience the same conditions at the same time, these conditions could have a greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other operators who have properties over a wider geographic area. For example, net production of approximately 8.7 Bcfe was deferred as a result of damage caused primarily by Hurricane Ike in 2009 and Hurricane Isaac caused net production deferral of approximately 2.9 Bcfe in 2012. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we experienced production deferrals of lower amounts due to other events, such as pipeline shut-ins and platform maintenance.\nProperties that we acquire may not produce as projected and we may be unable to immediately identify liabilities associated with these properties or obtain protection from sellers of such properties.\nOur business strategy includes growing by making acquisitions, which may include acquisitions of exploration and production companies, producing properties and undeveloped leasehold interests. Our acquisition of oil and natural gas properties requires assessments of many factors that are inherently inexact and may be inaccurate, including the following:\n\u2022\nacceptable prices for available properties;\n\u2022\namounts of recoverable reserves;\n\u2022\nestimates of future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nestimates of future exploratory, development and operating costs;\n\u2022\nestimates of the costs and timing of plugging and abandonment; and\n\u2022\nestimates of potential environmental and other liabilities.\nOur assessment of the acquired properties will not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become familiar enough with the properties to fully assess their capabilities and deficiencies. In the course of our due diligence, we have historically not physically inspected every well, platform or pipeline. Even if we had physically inspected each of these, our inspections may not have revealed structural and environmental problems, such as pipeline corrosion, well bore issues or groundwater contamination. We may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities associated with such risks. We may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations.\nWe may encounter difficulties integrating the operations of newly acquired oil and natural gas properties or businesses.\nIncreasing our reserve base through acquisitions is an important part of our business strategy. We may encounter difficulties integrating the operations of newly acquired oil and natural gas properties or businesses. In particular, we may face significant challenges in consolidating functions and integrating procedures, personnel and operations in an effective manner. The failure to successfully integrate such properties or businesses into our business may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any acquisition we make may involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\na significant increase in our indebtedness and working capital requirements;\n\u2022\nthe inability to timely and effectively integrate the operations of recently acquired businesses or assets;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of substantial unforeseen environmental and other liabilities arising out of the acquired businesses or assets, including liabilities arising from the operation of the acquired businesses or assets before our acquisition;\n\u2022\nour lack of drilling history in the geographic areas in which the acquired business operates;\n\u2022\ncustomer or key employee loss from the acquired business;\n\u2022\nincreased administration of new personnel;\n\u2022\nadditional costs due to increased scope and complexity of our operations; and\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our ongoing business.\nAdditionally, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business depending upon the character of the acquired properties, which may have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or be in different geographic locations than our existing properties. To the extent that we acquire properties substantially different from the properties in our primary operating region or acquire properties that require different technical expertise, we may not be able to realize the economic benefits of these acquisitions as efficiently as with acquisitions within our primary operating region. We may not be successful in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisition we may make.\nEstimates of our proved reserves depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in the estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities of and present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and the calculation of the present value of our reserves at December 31, 2016. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies - Oil and natural gas reserve quantities, under Part II, Item 7 for a discussion of the estimates and assumptions about our estimated oil and natural gas reserves information reported in Business under Part I, Item 1, Properties under Part I, Item 2 and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 21 - Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K.\nIn order to prepare our year-end reserve estimates, our independent petroleum consultant projected our production rates and timing of development expenditures. Our independent petroleum consultant also analyzed available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary and may not be under our control. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as crude oil and natural gas prices, operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Therefore, estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise.\nActual future production, crude oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will most likely vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. In addition, our independent petroleum consultant may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, drilling results, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our proved oil and natural gas reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month unweighted first-day-of-the-month average price for each product and costs in effect on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate.\nProspects that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercial quantities or quantities sufficient to meet our targeted rate of return.\nA prospect is an area in which we own an interest, could acquire an interest or have operating rights, and have what our geoscientists believe, based on available seismic and geological information, to be indications of economic accumulations of oil or natural gas. Our prospects are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a prospect that is ready to be drilled to a prospect that will require substantial seismic data processing and interpretation. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling and completion costs or to be economically viable. The use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercial quantities. We cannot assure that the analysis we perform using data from other wells, more fully explored prospects and/or producing fields will accurately predict the characteristics and potential reserves associated with our drilling prospects. Sustained low crude oil, NGLs and natural gas pricing will also significantly impact the projected rates of return of our projects without the assurance of significant reductions in costs of drilling and development. To the extent we drill additional wells in the deepwater and/or on the deep shelf, our drilling activities could become more expensive. In addition, the geological complexity of deepwater and deep shelf formations may make it more difficult for us to sustain our historical rates of drilling success. As a result, we can offer no assurance that we will find commercial quantities of oil and natural gas and, therefore, we can offer no assurance that we will achieve positive rates of return on our investments.\nMarket conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends substantially on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities, which in most cases are owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. We may be required to shut in wells because of a reduction in demand for our production or because of inadequacy or unavailability of pipelines or gathering system capacity. If that were to occur, then we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until arrangements were made to deliver our production to market. We have, in the past, been required to shut in wells when hurricanes have caused or threatened damage to pipelines and gathering stations. For example, in September 2008, as a result of Hurricane Ike, two of our operated platforms and eight non-operated platforms were toppled and a number of platforms, third-party pipelines and processing facilities upon which we depend to deliver our production to the marketplace were damaged. In 2012, under threat of Hurricane Isaac, we shut in most of our offshore production for a period of 10 to 25 days. Similar shut-ins of lower magnitude occurred in 2013.\nIn some cases, our wells are tied back to platforms owned by third-parties who do not have an economic interest in our wells and we cannot be assured that such parties will continue to process our oil and natural gas.\nCurrently, a portion of our oil and natural gas is processed for sale on platforms owned by third-parties with no economic interest in our wells and no other processing facilities would be available to process such oil and natural gas without significant investment by us. In addition, third-party platforms could be damaged or destroyed by hurricanes which could reduce or eliminate our ability to market our production. As of December 31, 2016, 10 fields, accounting for approximately 6.9 Bcfe (or 8%) of our 2016 production, are tied back to separate, third-party owned platforms. There can be no assurance that the owners of such platforms will continue to process our oil and natural gas production. If any of these platform operators ceases to operate their processing equipment, we may be required to shut in the associated wells, construct additional facilities or assume additional liability to re-establish production.\nIf third-party pipelines connected to our facilities become partially or fully unavailable to transport our crude oil and natural gas or if the prices charged by these third-party pipelines increase, our revenues or costs could be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon third-party pipelines that provide delivery options from our facilities. Because we do not own or operate these pipelines, their continued operation is not within our control. If any of these third-party pipelines become partially or fully unavailable to transport crude oil and natural gas, or if the gas quality specification for the natural gas pipelines changes so as to restrict our ability to transport natural gas on those pipelines, our revenues could be adversely affected. For example, in 2013, various pipelines were shut down causing production deferral of approximately 6.3 Bcfe. Our Mississippi Canyon 506 field (Wrigley) was the field most significantly affected by the shutdowns in recent years, as it was shut down for all of 2013 and more than half of 2014.\nCertain third-party pipelines have submitted or have made plans to submit requests to increase the fees they charge us to use these pipelines. These increased fees could adversely impact our revenues or operating costs, either of which would adversely impact our operating profits, cash flows and reserves.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration, development, production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas and operational safety. Future laws or regulations, any adverse change in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or our failure to comply with such legal requirements may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be required to make large and unanticipated capital expenditures to comply with governmental regulations, such as:\n\u2022\nland use restrictions;\n\u2022\nlease permit restrictions;\n\u2022\ndrilling bonds and other financial responsibility requirements, such as plugging and abandonment bonds;\n\u2022\nspacing of wells;\n\u2022\nunitization and pooling of properties;\n\u2022\nsafety precautions;\n\u2022\noperational reporting;\n\u2022\nreporting of natural gas sales for resale; and\n\u2022\ntaxation.\nUnder these laws and regulations, we could be liable for:\n\u2022\npersonal injuries;\n\u2022\nproperty and natural resource damages;\n\u2022\nwell site reclamation costs; and\n\u2022\ngovernmental sanctions, such as fines and penalties.\nOur operations could be significantly delayed or curtailed and our cost of operations could significantly increase as a result of regulatory requirements or restrictions. We are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. It is also possible that a portion of our oil and natural gas properties could be subject to eminent domain proceedings or other government takings for which we may not be adequately compensated. See Business - Regulation under Part I, Item 1 in this Form 10-K for a more detailed explanation of regulations impacting our business.\nOur operations may incur substantial liabilities to comply with environmental laws, endangered species laws and regulations.\nOur oil and natural gas operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations:\n\u2022\nrequire the acquisition of a permit or other approval before drilling or other regulated activity commences;\n\u2022\nrestrict the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities;\n\u2022\nlimit or prohibit exploration or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas or that may affect certain wildlife, including marine mammals; and\n\u2022\nimpose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in:\n\u2022\nthe assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nloss of our leases;\n\u2022\nincurrence of investigatory, remedial or corrective obligations; and\n\u2022\nthe imposition of injunctive relief, which could prohibit, limit or restrict our operations in a particular area.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our industry in general and on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. Under these environmental laws and regulations, we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination, regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination and regardless of whether our operations met previous standards in the industry at the time they were conducted. Our permits require that we report any incidents that cause or could cause environmental damages. Examples of recent proposed and final regulations include the following:\n\u2022\nGround-Level Ozone Standards. In October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the Clean Air Act lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (\u201cNAAQS\u201d) for ground-level ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion. The EPA must make attainment and non-attainment designations for specific geographic locations under the revised standards by October 1, 2017. Certain areas of the country currently in compliance with the former ground-level ozone NAAQS standard may be reclassified as non-attainment and such reclassification may make it more difficult to construct new or modify existing infrastructure to control air pollution in newly designated non-attainment areas to be in compliance with NAAQS. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.\n\u2022\nReduction of Methane Emissions by the Oil and Gas Industry. In June 2016, the EPA published new source performance standards for methane and volatile organic compound emissions from certain new, modified and reconstructed equipment, processes and activities across the oil and natural gas sector. The new standard includes first-time standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions, fugitive emissions from well sites and compressors, and equipment leaks at natural gas processing plants.\n\u2022\nProtected and Endangered Species. We conduct operations on leases in areas where certain species are known to exist that are currently protected or could become protected under state and federal laws. The presence of protected species, Marine Protection Areas, and other similar areas where we operate could cause increased costs arising from species or habitat protection measures, or could result in limitations or prohibitions on our exploration and production activities.\nThese and other regulatory changes could significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs or could result in delays to or limitations on our exploration and production activities, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. See Business - Regulation under Part I, Item 1 in this Form 10-K for a more detailed description of our environmental and endangered species regulations.\nThe ONNR\u2019s revised interpretations on determining appropriate allowances related to transportation and processing costs for natural gas could cause us to pay substantial amounts in back royalties and in future royalties.\nThe ONRR has publicly announced an \u201cunbundling\u201d initiative to revise the methodology employed by producers in determining the appropriate allowances for transportation and processing costs that are permitted to be deducted in determining royalties under Federal oil and gas leases. The ONRR\u2019s initiate requires re-computing allowable transportation and processing costs using revised guidance from the ONRR going back 84 months for every gas processing plant for which we had gas processed. In the second quarter of 2015, pursuant to the initiative, the Company received requests from the ONRR for additional data regarding the Company\u2019s transportation and processing allowances on natural gas production that was processed through a specific processing plant. The Company also received a preliminary determination notice from the ONRR asserting its preliminary determination that the Company\u2019s allocation of certain processing costs and plant fuel use at another processing plant were impermissibly allowed as deductions in the determination of royalties owed under Federal oil and gas leases. The Company has submitted responses covering certain plants and certain time periods and has not yet received responses as to the preliminary determination asserting the reasonableness of its revised allocation methodology of such costs. These open ONRR unbundling reviews, and any further similar reviews, could ultimately result in an order for payment of additional royalties under the Company\u2019s Federal oil and gas leases for current and prior periods. The Company is not able to determine the likelihood or range of any additional royalties or, if and when assessed, whether such amounts would be material.\nShould we fail to comply with all applicable FERC and CFTC administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nUnder the EP Act of 2005, FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA and NGPA to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1 million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. While our operations have not been regulated by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA, FERC has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional operations to FERC annual reporting and posting requirements. We also must comply with the anti-market manipulation rules enforced by FERC. Under the Commodity Exchange Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the CFTC, the CFTC has adopted anti-market manipulation rules relating to the prices or futures of commodities. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by Congress, the FERC, or the CFTC from time to time. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability. See Business - Regulation under Part I, Item 1 in this Form 10-K for further description of our regulations.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nThe EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. At the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented. The EPA, however, has adopted regulations under the federal Clean Air Act to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases. For example, the EPA imposes preconstruction and operating permit requirements on certain large stationary sources that are already potential sources of certain other significant pollutant emissions. The EPA also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions on an annual basis from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities. Federal agencies have also begun directly regulating emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas, from oil and natural gas operations. For example, in June 2016, the EPA published new source performance standards for methane and volatile organic compound emissions from certain new, modified and reconstructed equipment, processes and activities across the oil and natural gas sector. Compliance with these rules could result in increased compliance costs on our operations.\nIn addition, the United States Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and a number of states and grouping of states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal.\nThe adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. Our offshore operations are particularly at risk from severe climatic events. If any such climate effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See - Our business involves many uncertainties and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses. - under this Item 1A.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation and regulation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the negative effect of commodity price changes, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nIn July 2010, new comprehensive financial reform legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDF Act\u201d), was enacted that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The DF Act requires the CFTC, the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the DF Act. Although the CFTC has finalized certain regulations, others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished.\nIn one of its rulemaking proceedings still pending under the DF Act, the CFTC issued on December 5, 2016, re-proposed rules imposing position limits for certain futures and option contracts in various commodities (including oil and gas) and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Under the proposed rules on position limits, certain types of hedging transactions are exempt from these limits on the size of positions that may be held, provided that such hedging transactions satisfy the CFTC\u2019s requirements for certain enumerated \u201cbona fide hedging\u201d transactions or positions. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time.\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and the associated rules also will require us in connection with covered derivatives activities to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. Although the Company expects to qualify for the end-user exception from the mandatory clearing requirements for swaps entered to hedge its commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that the Company uses for hedging. In addition, for uncleared swaps, the CFTC or federal banking regulators may require end-users to enter into credit support documentation and/or post initial and variation margins. Posting of collateral could impact liquidity and reduce cash available to the Company for its needs. The DF Act may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties.\nThe full impact of the DF Act and related regulatory requirements upon the Company\u2019s business will not be known until the regulations are implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. The DF Act and regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties or reduce liquidity. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the DF Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.\nFinally, the DF Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the DF Act is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe own a non-producing platform in a highly regulated National Marine Sanctuary, which increases our compliance costs and subjects us to risk of significant fines and penalties if we do not maintain compliance.\nWe own a non-producing platform located in a National Marine Sanctuary in the Gulf of Mexico that is subject to special federal laws and regulations. We have been working with BSEE for over four years to obtain a permit to plug, abandon and remediate the well and production platform, but BSEE has refused to provide a decommissioning permit. Unique regulations related to operations in the National Marine Sanctuary include, among other things, prohibition of drilling activities within certain protected areas, restrictions on substances that may be discharged, depths of discharge in connection with drilling and production activities and limitations on mooring of vessels. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, incurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations or the imposition of injunctive relief, including cessation of production from wells associated with this platform.\nOur operations could be adversely impacted by security breaches, including cyber-security breaches, which could affect our production of oil and natural gas or could affect other parts of our business.\nWe rely on our information technology infrastructure and management information systems to operate and record aspects of our business. Although we take measures to protect against cybersecurity risks, including unauthorized access to our confidential and proprietary information, our security measures may not be able to detect or prevent every attempted breach. Similar to other companies, we have experienced cyber-attacks, although we have not suffered any material losses related to such attacks. Security breaches include, among other things, illegal hacking, computer viruses, or acts of vandalism or terrorism. A breach could result in an interruption in our operations, unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, unauthorized release of customer or employee data, violation of privacy or other laws and exposure to litigation. Any of these security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe loss of members of our senior management could adversely affect us.\nTo a large extent, we depend on the services of our senior management. The loss of the services of any of our senior management, including Tracy W. Krohn, our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jamie L. Vazquez, our President; John D. Gibbons, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Thomas P. Murphy, our Senior Vice President and Chief Operations Officer; and Stephen L. Schroeder, our Senior Vice President and Chief Technical Officer, could have a negative impact on our operations. We do not maintain or plan to obtain for the benefit of the Company any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals. See Executive Officers of the Registrant under Part I following Item 3 in this Form 10-K for more information regarding our senior management team.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nIn past years, legislation was proposed that would have made significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including certain U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to oil and gas companies. Such legislative proposals have included, but not been limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities, and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Congress could consider, and could include, some or all of these proposals as part of tax reform legislation, to accompany lower federal income tax rates. Moreover, other more general features of tax reform legislation, including changes to cost recovery rules and to the deductibility of interest expense, may be developed that also would change the taxation of oil and gas companies. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could take effect. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available to us, and any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCounterparty credit risk may negatively impact the conversion of our accounts receivables to cash.\nSubstantially all of our accounts receivable result from crude oil, NGLs and natural gas sales or joint interest billings to third parties in the energy industry. This concentration of customers and joint interest owners may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by any adverse changes in economic or other conditions. In recent years, market conditions resulting in downgrades to credit ratings of energy merchants affected the liquidity of several of our purchasers.", "PERMNO": 90533, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "WTI"}
