RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information in this report, the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating an investment in our securities. If any of the risks or uncertainties described in this Form 10-K actually occurs, our business, results of operations or financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. The risks and uncertainties described in this Form 10-K are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or that we currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not successfully commercialize Gralise\u00ae, CAMBIA\u00ae, Zipsor\u00ae, Lazanda\u00ae and NUCYNTA\u00ae (if we consummate the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition) our business will suffer.\nIn October 2011, we began commercial sales of Gralise\u00ae. In June 2012, we acquired Zipsor and began commercial promotion of Zipsor\u00ae in July 2012. In July 2013, we acquired Lazanda\u00ae and began commercial promotion of Lazanda\u00ae in October 2013. In December 2013, we acquired CAMBIA\u00ae and began commercial promotion of CAMBIA\u00ae in February 2014. In January 2015, we entered into an agreement with Janssen Pharma to acquire the United States rights to the NUCYNTA\u00ae franchise of pharmaceutical products. As a Company, we have a limited history of selling and marketing pharmaceutical products. In addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in this section, our ability to\nsuccessfully commercialize and generate revenues from Gralise\u00ae, CAMBIA\u00ae, Zipsor\u00ae, Lazanda\u00ae and NUCYNTA\u00ae (if we consummate the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition) depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:\n\u2022 develop and execute our sales and marketing strategies for our products;\n\u2022 achieve market acceptance of our products;\n\u2022 obtain and maintain adequate coverage, reimbursement and pricing from managed care, government and other third-party payers;\n\u2022 maintain, manage or scale the necessary sales, marketing, manufacturing, managed markets, and other capabilities and infrastructure that are required to successfully commercialize our products;\n\u2022 maintain intellectual property protection for our products; and\n\u2022 comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nIf we are unable to successfully achieve or perform these functions, we will not be able to maintain or increase our revenues from Gralise\u00ae, CAMBIA\u00ae, Zipsor\u00ae, Lazanda\u00ae and NUCYNTA\u00ae (if we consummate the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition) our business will suffer.\nIf generic manufacturers use litigation and regulatory means to obtain approval for generic versions of our products, our business will suffer.\nUnder the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (FDCA), the FDA can approve an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for a generic version of a branded drug without the ANDA applicant undertaking the clinical testing necessary to obtain approval to market a new drug. In place of such clinical studies, an ANDA applicant usually needs only to submit data demonstrating that its product has the same active ingredient(s) and is bioequivalent to the branded product, in addition to any data necessary to establish that any difference in strength, dosage, form, inactive ingredients or delivery mechanism does not result in different safety or efficacy profiles, as compared to the reference drug.\nThe FDCA requires an applicant for a drug that relies, at least in part, on the patent of one of our branded drugs to notify us of their application and potential infringement of our patent rights. Upon receipt of this notice we have 45 days to bring a patent infringement suit in federal district court against the company seeking approval of a product covered by one of our patents. The discovery, trial and appeals process in such suits can take several years. If such a suit is commenced, the FDCA provides a 30-month stay on the FDA's approval of the competitor's application. Such litigation is often time-consuming and quite costly and may result in generic competition if the patents at issue are not upheld or if the generic competitor is found not to infringe such patents. If the litigation is resolved in favor of the applicant or the challenged patent expires during the 30-month stay period, the stay is lifted and the FDA may thereafter approve the application based on the standards for approval of ANDAs.\nAs described in greater detail under \"LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\" below, in August 2014, we received a favorable ruling in our patent litigation against Actavis. The lawsuit was filed in March 2012 against Actavis for infringement of certain U.S. patents listed in the Patent and Exclusivity Information Addendum of FDA's publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the Orange Book) for Gralise\u00ae. A bench trial was completed on May 20, 2014 and in August 2014 the court ruled in our favor, finding that Actavis infringed all asserted claims of all seven patents asserted in trial and upholding the validity of the patents, which expire between September 2016 and February 2024. On September 15, 2014, Actavis filed a notice appealing the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On February 2, 2015, Actavis filed its opening brief with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. A successful\nappeal of the trial court's ruling by Actavis would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn June 28, 2013, we received from Banner Pharmacaps Inc. (Banner) a Notice of Certification for U.S. Patent Nos. 6,365,180; 7,662,858; 7,884,095; 7,939,518 and 8,110,606 under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355 (j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV) (Zipsor\u00ae Paragraph IV Letter) certifying that Banner has submitted and the FDA has accepted for filing an ANDA for 25mg diclofenac potassium capsules, (Banner ANDA Product). Banner has granted exclusive rights to the Banner ANDA Product to Watson Laboratories Inc., a subsidiary of Actavis plc. The letter states that the Banner ANDA Product contains the required bioavailability or bioequivalence data to Zipsor\u00ae and certifies that Banner intends to obtain FDA approval to engage in commercial manufacture, use or sale of Banner's ANDA product before the expiration of the above identified patents, which are listed for Zipsor\u00ae in the Orange Book. We commenced the lawsuit within the 45 days required to automatically bar the FDA from approving the Banner ANDA Product for 30 months or until a district court decision that is adverse to the asserted patents, whichever may occur earlier. Absent a court order, the 30-month stay is expected to expire in December 2015.\nSeveral ANDAs have been filed with respect to NUCYNTA\u00ae. Janssen Pharma and Gr\u00fcnenthal have timely commenced lawsuits against each ANDA filer for infringing certain patents licensed by Janssen Pharma from Gr\u00fcnenthal which are listed for NUCYNTA\u00ae in the Orange Book. We will assume responsibility for these lawsuits if we consummate the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition.\nAny introduction of one or more products generic to Gralise\u00ae, CAMBIA\u00ae, Zipsor\u00ae or Lazanda\u00ae, and if we consummate the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition, to NUCYNTA\u00ae , whether as a result of an ANDA or otherwise, would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The filing of the ANDAs described above, or any other ANDA or similar application in respect to any of our products, or the successful appeal of the favorable ruling received in the Gralise\u00ae litigation, could have an adverse impact on our stock price. Moreover, if the patents covering our products were not upheld in litigation or if a generic competitor is found not to infringe these patents, the resulting generic competition would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to negotiate acceptable pricing or obtain adequate reimbursement for our products from third-party payers, our business will suffer.\nSales of our products will depend in part on the availability of acceptable pricing and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers such as:\n\u2022 government health administration authorities;\n\u2022 private health insurers;\n\u2022 health maintenance organizations;\n\u2022 managed care organizations;\n\u2022 pharmacy benefit management companies; and\n\u2022 other healthcare-related organizations.\nIf reimbursement is not available for our products or product candidates, demand for these products may be limited. Further, any delay in receiving approval for reimbursement from third-party payers could have an adverse effect on our future revenues. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, including pharmaceuticals. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of pharmaceutical products. Our products may not be considered cost effective, and adequate third-party reimbursement may be unavailable to\nenable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an acceptable return on our investment. Any third-party payer decision not to approve pricing for, or provide adequate coverage and reimbursement of, our products, including by limiting or denying reimbursement for new products or excluding products that were previously eligible for reimbursement, would limit the market acceptance and commercial prospects of our products and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFederal and state governments in the United States continue to propose and pass new legislation, such as the ACA, which is designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for our products and any product that we may develop or acquire.\nWe may be unable to compete successfully in the pharmaceutical industry.\nGabapentin is currently sold by Pfizer Inc. as Neurontin\u00ae for adjunctive therapy for epileptic seizures and for PHN. Pfizer's basic U.S. patents relating to Neurontin\u00ae have expired, and numerous companies have received approval to market generic versions of the immediate release product. Pfizer has also developed Lyrica\u00ae (pregabalin), which has been approved for marketing in the United States for post herpetic pain, fibromyalgia, diabetic nerve pain, adjunctive therapy, epileptic seizures, and nerve pain associated with spinal cord injury and has captured a significant portion of the market. In December 2014, Pfizer announced positive Phase 3 clinical trial results for its controlled release formulation of Lyrica\u00ae as a treatment for PHN. In June 2012, GlaxoSmithKline and Xenoport, Inc. received approval to market Horizant\u2122 (gabapentin enacarbil extended-release tablets) for the management of PHN. There are other products prescribed for or under development for PHN which are now or may become competitive with Gralise\u00ae.\nDiclofenac, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Zipsor\u00ae, is an NSAID that is approved in the United States for the treatment of mild to moderate pain in adults, including the symptoms of arthritis. Both branded and generic versions of diclofenac are marketed in the U.S. Zipsor\u00ae competes against other drugs that are widely used to treat mild to moderate pain in the acute setting. In addition, a number of other companies are developing NSAIDs in a variety of dosage forms for the treatment of mild to moderate pain and related indications. Other drugs are in clinical development to treat acute pain.\nAn alternate formulation of diclofenac is the active ingredient in CAMBIA\u00ae that is approved in the United States for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. CAMBIA\u00ae competes with a number of triptans which are used to treat migraine and certain other headaches. Currently, seven triptans are available and sold in the United States (almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan and zolmitriptan), as well as a fixed-dose combination product containing sumatriptan plus naproxen. There are other products prescribed for or under development for the treatment of migraines which are now or may become competitive with CAMBIA\u00ae.\nFentanyl, an opioid analgesic, is currently sold by a number of companies for the treatment of breakthrough pain in opioid-tolerant cancer patients. Branded fentanyl products against which Lazanda\u00ae currently competes include Subsys\u00ae, which is sold by Insys Therapeutics, Inc., Fentora\u00ae and Actiq\u00ae, which are sold by Cephalon Inc., Abstral\u00ae, which is sold by Galena Biophama Inc., and Onsolis\u00ae, which is sold by BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. (BDSI). Generic fentanyl products against which Lazanda\u00ae currently competes are sold by Mallinckrodt, Par and Actavis.\nCompetition in the pharmaceutical industry is intense and we expect competition to increase. If we consummate the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition, we will face significant competition from a number of pharmaceutical products competitive with NUCYNTA\u00ae. Competing products currently under development or developed in the future may prove superior to our products and achieve greater\ncommercial acceptance. Most of our principal competitors have substantially greater financial, sales, marketing, personnel and research and development resources than we do.\nWe may incur significant liability if it is determined that we are promoting or have in the past promoted the \"off-label\" use of drugs.\nCompanies may not promote drugs for \"off-label\" use-that is, uses that are not described in the product's labeling and that differ from those approved by the FDA. Physicians may prescribe drug products for off-label uses, and such off-label uses are common across some medical specialties. Although the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician's choice of treatments, the FDCA and FDA regulations restrict communications on the subject of off-label uses of drug products by pharmaceutical companies. The Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG), the FDA, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) all actively enforce laws and regulations prohibiting promotion of off-label use and the promotion of products for which marketing clearance has not been obtained. If the OIG or the FDA takes the position that we are or may be out of compliance with the requirements and restrictions described above, and we are investigated for or found to have improperly promoted off-label use, we may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions. In addition, management's attention could be diverted from our business operations and our reputation could be damaged.\nPharmaceutical marketing is subject to substantial regulation in the United States and any failure by us or our collaborative partners to comply with applicable statutes or regulations could adversely affect our business.\nAll marketing activities associated with Gralise\u00ae, Zipsor\u00ae, Lazanda\u00ae and CAMBIA\u00ae, as well as marketing activities related to any other products which we may acquire, such as NUCYNTA\u00ae , or for which we obtain regulatory approval, will be subject to numerous federal and state laws governing the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products. The FDA regulates post-approval promotional labeling and advertising to ensure that they conform to statutory and regulatory requirements. In addition to FDA restrictions, the marketing of prescription drugs is subject to laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and abuse under government healthcare programs. For example, the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits giving things of value to induce the prescribing or purchase of products that are reimbursed by federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government. Under this law, in recent years, the federal government has brought claims against drug manufacturers alleging that certain marketing activities caused false claims for prescription drugs to be submitted to federal programs. Many states have similar statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, and, in some states, such statutes or regulations apply regardless of the payer. If we, or our collaborative partners, fail to comply with applicable FDA regulations or other laws or regulations relating to the marketing of our products, we could be subject to criminal prosecution, civil penalties, seizure of products, injunctions, and exclusion of our products from reimbursement under government programs, as well as other regulatory actions against our product candidates, our collaborative partners or us.\nAcquisition of new and complementary businesses, products, and technologies is a key element of our corporate strategy. If we are unable to successfully identify and acquire such businesses, products or technologies, our business and prospects will be limited.\nSince June 2012, we have acquired Zipsor\u00ae, Lazanda\u00ae and CAMBIA\u00ae. In January 2015, we entered into an agreement with Janssen Pharma to acquire the United States rights to the NUCYNTA\u00ae franchise of pharmaceutical products. An important element of our business strategy is to\nactively seek to acquire products or companies and to in-license or seek co-promotion rights to products that could be sold by our sales force. We cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully pursue and complete any further acquisitions, including the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition, or whether we would be able to successfully integrate any acquired business, product or technology or retain any key employees. Integrating any business, product or technology we may acquire, including NUCYNTA\u00ae, could be expensive and time consuming, disrupt our ongoing business, and distract our management. If we are unable to enhance and broaden our product offerings, unable to effectively integrate any acquired businesses, products or technologies, or achieve the anticipated benefits of any acquired business, product or technology, our business and prospects will be limited. In addition, any amortization or charges resulting from the costs of such acquisitions will adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we engage in strategic transactions that fail to achieve the anticipated results and synergies, our business will suffer.\nWe may seek to engage in strategic transactions with third parties, such as company acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, divestitures or business combinations. We may face significant competition in seeking potential strategic partners and transactions, and the negotiation process for acquiring any product or engaging in strategic transactions can be time-consuming and complex. Engaging in strategic transactions, including the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition, may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, pose integration challenges and fail to achieve the anticipated results or synergies or distract our management and business, which may harm our business.\nAs part of an effort to acquire a product or company or to enter into other strategic transactions, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying, evaluating and assessing material risks involved in the transaction. Despite our efforts, we ultimately may be unsuccessful in ascertaining, evaluating and accurately assessing all such risks and, as a result, might not realize the intended advantages of the transaction. We may also assume liabilities and legal risks in connection with a transaction, including those relating to activities of the seller prior to the consummation of the transaction and contracts that we assume. Failure to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions or strategic transactions that we may consummate, including the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition, whether as a result of identified or unidentified risks, integration difficulties, regulatory setbacks, governmental investigations, litigation or other events, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on third parties that are single source suppliers to manufacture our products. If these suppliers are unable to manufacture and supply our products, our business will suffer.\nPatheon Puerto Rico Inc. is our sole supplier for Gralise\u00ae pursuant to a manufacturing and supply agreement we entered into with Patheon in September 2011. Accucaps Industries Limited is our sole supplier for Zipsor\u00ae pursuant to a manufacturing agreement we assumed in connection with our acquisition of Zipsor\u00ae in June 2012. DPT Lakewood Inc. is our sole supplier for Lazanda\u00ae pursuant to a manufacturing and supply agreement that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of Lazanda\u00ae in July 2013. MiPharm, S.p.A is our sole supplier for CAMBIA\u00ae pursuant to a manufacturing and supply agreement that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of CAMBIA\u00ae in December 2013. We have one qualified supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredient in each of Gralise\u00ae, CAMBIA\u00ae, Zipsor\u00ae and Lazanda\u00ae. If we consummate the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition, Janssen Pharma and its affiliates will be our sole supplier of both NUCYNTA\u00ae and tapentadol, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in NUCYNTA\u00ae. We do not have, and we do not intend to establish in the foreseeable future, internal commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. Rather, we intend to use the facilities of third parties to manufacture products for clinical trials and commercialization. Our\ndependence on third parties for the manufacture of our products and our product candidates may adversely affect our ability to deliver such products on a timely or competitive basis, if at all. Any failure to obtain Gralise\u00ae, CAMBIA\u00ae, Zipsor\u00ae, Lazanda\u00ae or NUCYNTA\u00ae (if we consummate the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition), or active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients or components from our suppliers could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. We, our third-party manufacturers and our suppliers are subject to numerous regulations, including current FDA regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping and quality standards. Similar regulations are in effect in other countries. Our third-party manufacturers and suppliers are independent entities who are subject to their own unique operational and financial risks which are out of our control. If we or any of these third-party manufacturers or suppliers fail to perform as required or fail to comply with the regulations of the FDA and other applicable governmental authorities, our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis or receive royalties or continue our clinical trials could be adversely affected. The manufacturing processes of our third party manufacturers and suppliers may also be found to violate the proprietary rights of others. To the extent these risks materialize and adversely affect such third-party manufacturers' performance obligations to us, and we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of required products on acceptable terms, or if we encounter delays and difficulties in our relationships with manufacturers or suppliers, our business, results of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property and may be liable for infringing the intellectual property of others.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and technologies, and to preserve our trade secrets. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary rights, by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions to cover certain aspects of our technology. We hold issued United States patents and have patent applications pending in the United States. In addition, we are pursuing patent applications relating to our technologies in the United States and abroad. We have also applied for patents in numerous foreign countries. Some of those countries have granted our applications and other applications are still pending. Our pending patent applications may lack priority over other applications or may not result in the issuance of patents. Even if issued, our patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide protection against competitors with similar technologies and may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or may not provide us with competitive advantages against competing products. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how, which are difficult to protect. We seek to protect such information, in part, through entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, collaborative partners and others before such persons or entities have access to our proprietary trade secrets and know-how. These confidentiality agreements may not be effective in certain cases, due to, among other things, the lack of an adequate remedy for breach of an agreement or a finding that an agreement is unenforceable. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.\nOur ability to develop our technologies and to make commercial sales of products using our technologies also depends on not infringing other patents or intellectual property rights. We are not aware of any such intellectual property claims against us. However, the pharmaceutical industry has experienced extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Patents issued to third parties relating to sustained release drug formulations or particular pharmaceutical compounds could in the future be asserted against us, although we believe that we do not infringe any valid claim of any patents. If claims concerning any of our products were to arise and it was determined that these\nproducts infringe a third party's proprietary rights, we could be subject to substantial damages for past infringement or be forced to stop or delay our activities with respect to any infringing product, unless we can obtain a license, or we may have to redesign our product so that it does not infringe upon such third party's patent rights, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds or time. Such a license may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we, our collaborators or our licensors were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same intellectual property. In addition, any public announcements related to litigation or interference proceedings initiated or threatened against us, even if such claims are without merit, could cause our stock price to decline.\nFrom time to time, we may become aware of activities by third parties that may infringe our patents. Infringement by others of our patents may reduce our market shares (if a related product is approved) and, consequently, our potential future revenues and adversely affect our patent rights if we do not take appropriate enforcement action. We may need to engage in litigation to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. For instance, we are engaged in litigation against one Zipsor\u00ae ANDA filer. If we consummate the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition, we will assume responsibility for the pending litigation against the NUCYNTA\u00ae ANDA filers. Also, in January 2013 and April 2013, we filed lawsuits against Purdue and Endo, respectively, for infringement of certain of our Acuform drug delivery technology patents. In response to our lawsuits, Purdue and Endo are challenging the validity of the patents we asserted in inter partes review proceedings before the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In these or other proceedings, our issued or licensed patents may not be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction or the PTAB. Whether or not the outcome of litigation or the PTAB proceeding is favorable to us, the litigation and the proceedings takes significant time, may be expensive, and may divert management attention from other business concerns. We may also be required to participate in derivation proceedings or other post-grant proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the purposes of, respectively, determining the priority of inventions in connection with our patent applications or determining validity of claims in our issued patents. Adverse determinations in litigation or proceedings at the United States Patent and Trademark Office would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and could require us to seek licenses which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or subject us to significant liabilities to third parties. If we need but cannot obtain a license, we may be prevented from marketing the affected product.\nHealth care reform could increase our expenses and adversely affect the commercial success of our products.\nThe ACA includes numerous provisions that affect pharmaceutical companies, some of which became effective immediately upon President Obama signing the law, and others of which are scheduled to take effect over the next several years. For example, the ACA seeks to expand healthcare coverage to the uninsured through private health insurance reforms and an expansion of Medicaid. The ACA also imposes substantial costs on pharmaceutical manufacturers, such as an increase in liability for rebates paid to Medicaid, new drug discounts that must be offered to certain enrollees in the Medicare prescription drug benefit and an annual fee imposed on all manufacturers of brand prescription drugs in the U.S. The ACA also requires increased disclosure obligations and an expansion of an existing program requiring pharmaceutical discounts to certain types of hospitals and federally subsidized clinics and contains cost-containment measures that could reduce reimbursement levels for pharmaceutical products. The ACA also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs, biologics, devices and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of\ninteractions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. These and other aspects of the ACA, including the regulations that may be imposed in connection with the implementation of the ACA, could increase our expenses and adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates.\nChanges in laws and regulations may adversely affect our business.\nThe manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of our products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Changes in laws and regulations applicable to the pharmaceutical industry could potentially affect our business. For example, federal, state and local governments have recently given increased attention to the public health issue of opioid abuse. At the federal level, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy continues to coordinate efforts between the FDA, United States Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and other agencies to address this issue. The DEA continues to increase its efforts to hold manufacturers, distributors, prescribers and pharmacies accountable through various enforcement actions as well as the implementation of compliance practices for controlled substances. In addition, many state legislatures are considering various bills intended to reduce opioid abuse, for example by establishing prescription drug monitoring programs and mandating prescriber education. These and other changes in laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approval, we will be limited in our ability to commercialize our products, and our business will suffer.\nThe regulatory process is expensive and time consuming. Even after investing significant time and expenditures on clinical trials, we may not obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates. Data obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval, and the FDA may not agree with our methods of clinical data analysis or our conclusions regarding safety and/or efficacy. Significant clinical trial delays could impair our ability to commercialize our products and could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do. In addition, changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review of each submitted new application may cause delays or rejections. Even if we receive regulatory approval, this approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which we can market a product.\nFurther, with respect to our approved products, once regulatory approval is obtained, a marketed product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review. The discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or manufacturing facility, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Manufacturers of approved products are also subject to ongoing regulation and inspection, including compliance with FDA regulations governing current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) or Quality System Regulation (QSR). The FDCA, the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA) and other federal and foreign statutes and regulations govern and influence the testing, manufacturing, packing, labeling, storing, record keeping, safety, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of our products. In addition, with respect to Lazanda\u00ae, we and our partners are also subject to ongoing DEA regulatory obligations, including annual registration renewal, security, recordkeeping, theft and loss reporting, periodic inspection and annual quota allotments for the raw material for commercial production of our products. The failure to comply with these regulations could result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, non-renewal of marketing applications or authorizations or criminal prosecution, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are also required to report adverse events associated with our products to the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Unexpected or serious health or safety concerns could result in labeling changes,\nrecalls, market withdrawals or other regulatory actions. Recalls may be issued at our discretion or at the discretion of the FDA or other empowered regulatory agencies. For example, in June 2010, we instituted a voluntary class 2 recall of 52 lots of our 500mg Glumetza product after chemical traces of 2,4,6-tribromoanisole (TBA) were found in the product bottle.\nWe are subject to risks associated with NDAs submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\nThe products we develop generally are or will be submitted for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, which was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of a NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. For instance, the NDA for Gralise\u00ae relies on the FDA's prior approval of Neurontin, the immediate release formulation of gabapentin initially approved by the FDA.\nFor NDAs submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, the patent certification and related provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act apply. In accordance with the Hatch-Waxman Act, such NDAs may be required to include certifications, known as \"Paragraph IV certifications,\" that certify any patents listed in the FDA's Orange Book publication in respect to any product referenced in the 505(b)(2) application are invalid, unenforceable, and/or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the product that is the subject of the 505(b)(2) application. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the holder of the NDA which the 505(b)(2) application references may file a patent infringement lawsuit after receiving notice of the Paragraph IV certification. Filing of a patent infringement lawsuit triggers a one-time automatic 30-month stay of the FDA's ability to approve the 505(b)(2) application. Accordingly, we may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of one or more products only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before such products may be commercialized, if at all. A Section 505(b)(2) application may also not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. The FDA may also require us to perform one or more additional clinical studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new formulation for all or only some of the indications sought by us. The FDA may also reject our future Section 505(b)(2) submissions and require us to file such submissions under Section 501(b)(1) of the FDCA, which could be considerably more expensive and time consuming. These factors, among others, may limit our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nIf a product liability claim against us is successful, our business will suffer.\nOur business involves exposure to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development production and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. Side effects, manufacturing defects, misuse or abuse of our products could result in patient injury or death. For instance, Lazanda\u00ae is a self-administered, opioid analgesic that contains fentanyl, a Schedule II \"controlled substance\" under the CSA. A patient's failure to follow instructions on the use and administration of, or the abuse of Lazanda\u00ae could result in injury or death. In addition, patients using Lazanda\u00ae have been diagnosed with cancer, an often fatal disease. Patient injury or death can result in product liability claims being brought against us, even if our products did not cause an injury or death. Product liability claims may be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others who come into contact with our products.\nWe have obtained product liability insurance for clinical trials currently underway and forecasted 2015 sales of our products, but:\n\u2022 we may be unable to maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms;\n\u2022 we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance for future trials;\n\u2022 we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance for future products;\n\u2022 we may be unable to secure increased coverage as the commercialization of our Acuform gastric retentive technology expands; or\n\u2022 our insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities.\nOur inability to obtain or maintain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products. Defending a law suit could be costly and significantly divert management's attention from conducting our business. If third parties were to bring a successful product liability claim or series of claims against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liability limits, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we consummate the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition, the foregoing risks will also apply to tapentadol, a Schedule II substance and the active pharmaceutical ingredient in NUCYNTA\u00ae.\nOur collaborative arrangements may give rise to disputes over commercial terms, contract interpretation and ownership or protection of our intellectual property and may adversely affect the commercial success of our products.\nWe currently have collaboration or license arrangements with a number of companies, including Mallinckrodt, Janssen Pharma, Salix and Ironwood. In addition, we have in the past and may in the future enter into other collaborative arrangements, some of which have been based on less definitive agreements, such as memoranda of understanding, material transfer agreements, options or feasibility agreements. We may not execute definitive agreements formalizing these arrangements.\nCollaborative relationships are generally complex and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of the parties, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations, especially when the applicable collaborative provisions have not been fully negotiated and documented. Such disputes can delay collaborative research, development or commercialization of potential products, and can lead to lengthy, expensive litigation or arbitration. The terms of collaborative arrangements may also limit or preclude us from developing products or technologies developed pursuant to such collaborations. Additionally, the collaborative partners under these arrangements might breach the terms of their respective agreements or fail to maintain, protect or prevent infringement of the licensed patents or our other intellectual property rights by third parties. Moreover, negotiating collaborative arrangements often takes considerably longer to conclude than the parties initially anticipate, which could cause us to enter into less favorable agreement terms that delay or defer recovery of our development costs and reduce the funding available to support key programs. Any failure by our collaborative partners to abide by the terms of their respective agreements with us, including their failure to accurately calculate, report or pay any royalties payable to us, may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to enter into future collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms, which could harm our ability to develop and commercialize our current and potential future products and technologies. Other factors relating to collaborations that may adversely affect the commercial success of our products include:\n\u2022 any parallel development by a collaborative partner of competitive technologies or products;\n\u2022 arrangements with collaborative partners that limit or preclude us from developing products or technologies;\n\u2022 premature termination of a collaboration agreement; or\n\u2022 failure by a collaborative partner to devote sufficient resources to the development and commercial sales of products using our current and potential future products and technologies.\nOur collaborative arrangements do not necessarily restrict our collaborative partners from competing with us or restrict their ability to market or sell competitive products. Our current and any future collaborative partners may pursue existing or other development-stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. Our collaborative partners may also terminate their collaborative relationships with us or otherwise decide not to proceed with development and commercialization of our products.\nAny failure by us or our partners to comply with applicable statutes or regulations relating to controlled substances could adversely affect our business.\nLazanda\u00ae is an opioid analgesic that contains fentanyl, a regulated \"controlled substance\" under the CSA. The CSA establishes, among other things, certain registration, production quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule II substances being those that present the highest risk of abuse. Fentanyl is listed by the DEA as a Schedule II substance under the CSA. The manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use, among other things, of controlled substances that are pharmaceutical products are subject to a high degree of regulation. For example, generally all Schedule II substance prescriptions, such as prescriptions for fentanyl, must be written and signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription.\nThe DEA also conducts periodic inspections of certain registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Facilities that conduct research, manufacture, distribute, import or export controlled substances must be registered to perform these activities and have the security, control and inventory mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent drug loss and diversion. Failure to maintain compliance, particularly non-compliance resulting in loss or diversion, can result in regulatory action that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to restrict, suspend or revoke those registrations and in certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings against us or our manufacturing and distribution partners, and our respective employees, officers and directors.\nIn addition to federal regulations, many individual states also have controlled substances laws. Although state controlled substances laws generally mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions they may separately schedule our products. Any failure by us or our partners to obtain separate state registrations, permits, or licenses in order to be able to obtain, handle, and distribute fentanyl or to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions by the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law and would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we consummate the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition, the foregoing risks will apply to tapentadol, which is a Schedule II substance under the CSA and the active pharmaceutical ingredient in NUCYNTA\u00ae.\nLimitations on the production of Schedule II substances in the United States could limit our ability to successfully commercialize Lazanda\u00ae and NUCYNTA\u00ae (if we consummate the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition).\nThe availability and production of all Schedule II substances, including fentanyl, is limited by the DEA through a quota system that includes a national aggregate quota, production quotas for individual manufacturers and procurement quotas that authorize the procurement of specific quantities of Schedule II controlled substances for use in drug manufacturing. The DEA annually establishes an aggregate quota for total fentanyl production in the United States based on the DEA's estimate of the quantity needed to meet commercial and scientific need. The aggregate quota of fentanyl that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States annually is allocated among individual fentanyl drug manufacturers, which must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production quotas. In turn, the manufacturer of Lazanda\u00ae has to obtain a procurement quota to source fentanyl for the production of Lazanda\u00ae. The DEA requires substantial evidence and documentation of expected legitimate medical and scientific needs before assigning quotas for these activities. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Based on a variety of factors, including public policy considerations, the DEA may set the aggregate fentanyl quota lower than the total amount requested by individual manufacturers. Although through our manufacturing partner we are permitted to ask the DEA to increase our manufacturer's procurement quota after it is initially established, we cannot be certain that the DEA would act favorably upon such a request. In addition, our manufacturer obtains a procurement quota for fentanyl for all fentanyl products manufactured at their facility, which is allocated to Lazanda\u00ae at the manufacturer's discretion. If the available quota of fentanyl is insufficient to meet our commercial demand or clinical needs, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, any delay or refusal by the DEA or our manufacturer in establishing the production or procurement quota or any reduction by the DEA or our manufacturer in the allocated quota for fentanyl could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we consummate the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition, the foregoing risks will also apply to tapentadol, a Schedule II substance and the active pharmaceutical ingredient in NUCYNTA\u00ae.\nThe FDA-mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program may limit the commercial success of Lazanda\u00ae.\nLazanda\u00ae is subject to a FDA-mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) protocol that requires enrollment and participation in the REMS program to prescribe, dispense or distribute Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) medicines, including Lazanda\u00ae, for outpatient use. Many physicians, health care practitioners and pharmacies are unwilling to enroll and participate in the TIRF REMS program. As a result, there are relatively few prescribers and dispensers of TIRF products. If we are not able to successfully promote Lazanda\u00ae to participants in the TIRF REMS program, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients in our clinical trials and other third parties to manage the trials and to perform related data collection and analysis, and, as a result, we may face costs and delays outside of our control.\nWe rely on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients and other third parties to manage our trials and to perform related data collection and analysis. However, we may be unable to control the amount and timing of resources that the clinical sites that conduct the clinical testing may devote to our clinical trials. If our clinical investigators and clinical sites fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials or fail to enroll them on our planned schedule, we will be unable to complete these trials or to complete them as planned, which could delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nOur agreements with clinical investigators and clinical sites for clinical testing and for trial management services place substantial responsibilities on these parties, which could result in delays in, or termination of, our clinical trials if these parties fail to perform as expected. For example, if any of our clinical trial sites fail to comply with FDA-approved good clinical practices, we may be unable to use the data gathered at those sites. If these clinical investigators, clinical sites or other third parties do not carry out their contractual duties or obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our product candidates.\nThe development of drug candidates is inherently difficult and uncertain and we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates or those of our collaborative partners will be approved for marketing or, if approved, will achieve market acceptance.\nClinical development is a long, expensive and uncertain process and is subject to delays and failures. Our own product candidates and those of our collaborative partners are subject to the risk that any or all of them may be found to be ineffective or unsafe, or otherwise may fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances. Positive or encouraging results of prior clinical trials are not necessarily indicative of the results obtained in later clinical trials, as was the case with the Phase 3 trial for Gralise\u00ae for the management of PHN that we completed in 2007, and with the Phase 3 trials evaluating Sefelsa, our prior product candidate, for menopausal hot flashes, the last of which we completed in October 2011. In addition, data obtained from pivotal clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.\nOther factors could delay or result in termination of our clinical trials, including:\n\u2022 negative or inconclusive results;\n\u2022 patient noncompliance with the protocol;\n\u2022 adverse medical events or side effects among patients during the clinical trials;\n\u2022 FDA inspections of our clinical operations; and\n\u2022 actual or perceived lack of efficacy or safety of the product candidate.\nWe are unable to predict whether any of our product candidates or those of our collaborative partners will receive regulatory clearances or be successfully manufactured or marketed. Further, due to the extended testing and regulatory review process required before marketing clearance can be obtained, the time frame for commercializing a product is long and uncertain. Even if these other product candidates receive regulatory clearance, our products may not achieve or maintain market acceptance. Also, DM-1992 uses the Acuform technology. If it is discovered that the Acuform technology could have adverse effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective as a delivery system for drugs or therapeutics, our product development efforts and our business could be significantly harmed.\nEven assuming our products obtain regulatory approval, successful commercialization requires:\n\u2022 market acceptance;\n\u2022 cost-effective commercial scale production; and\n\u2022 reimbursement under private or governmental health plans.\nAny material delay or failure in the governmental approval process and/or the successful commercialization of our potential products or those of our collaborative partners could adversely impact our financial position and liquidity.\nThe market price of our common stock historically has been volatile. Our results of operations may fluctuate and affect our stock price.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. From June 30, 2013 through December 31, 2014, our stock price has ranged from $5.63 to $16.64 per share.\nFactors affecting our operating results and that could adversely affect our stock price include:\n\u2022 the degree of commercial success and market acceptance of Gralise\u00ae, CAMBIA\u00ae, Zipsor\u00ae and Lazanda\u00ae;\n\u2022 our ability to consummate the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition, and if consummated, the degree of commercial success of NUCYNTA\u00ae and the outcome of the pending patent litigation against the filers of ANDAs for NUCYNTA\u00ae.\n\u2022 filings and other regulatory or governmental actions or proceedings related to our products and product candidates and those of our collaborative partners;\n\u2022 the outcome of our patent infringement litigation against the filer of an ANDA for Zipsor\u00ae;\n\u2022 the reversal or any appeal of the district court's favorable ruling in our patent infringement litigation against the filer of an ANDA for Gralise\u00ae;\n\u2022 developments concerning proprietary rights, including patents, infringement allegations, inter party review proceedings and litigation matters;\n\u2022 our collaborative partners' compliance or non-compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and with obligations under our collaborative agreements;\n\u2022 our plans to acquire, in-license or co-promote other products, or acquire or combine with other companies, and our degree of success in realizing the intended advantages of, and mitigating any risks associated with, any such transaction;\n\u2022 adverse events related to our products, including recalls;\n\u2022 interruptions of manufacturing or supply, or other manufacture or supply difficulties;\n\u2022 variations in revenues obtained from collaborative agreements, including milestone payments, royalties, license fees and other contract revenues;\n\u2022 adoption of new technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 the outcome of our patent infringement litigation against Purdue and Endo;\n\u2022 decisions by collaborative partners to proceed or not to proceed with subsequent phases of a collaboration or program;\n\u2022 sales of large blocks of our common stock or the dilutive effect of our 2021 Notes; and\n\u2022 variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue, and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations.\nAs a result of these factors, our stock price may continue to be volatile and investors may be unable to sell their shares at a price equal to, or above, the price paid. Any significant drops in our stock price could give rise to shareholder lawsuits, which are costly and time consuming to defend against and which may adversely affect our ability to raise capital while the suits are pending, even if the suits are ultimately resolved in our favor.\nIn addition, if the market for pharmaceutical stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us.\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past and may incur operating losses in the future.\nTo date, we have recorded revenues from license fees, product sales, royalties, collaborative research and development arrangements and feasibility studies. For 2014 and 2013, we recognized net income of $131.8 million and $43.3 million, respectively. Although we have achieved profitability in recent periods, we have incurred operating losses in the past and may incur operating losses in 2015 and in future years. Any such losses may have an adverse impact on our total assets, shareholders' equity and working capital.\nOur existing capital resources are not sufficient to fund the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition and may not be sufficient to fund our future operations or product acquisitions and strategic transactions which we may pursue.\nWe fund our operations primarily through revenues from product sales and do not have any committed sources of capital. To the extent that our existing capital resources and revenues from ongoing operations are insufficient to fund our future operations, or product acquisitions and strategic transactions which we may pursue, such as the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition, we will have to raise additional funds through the sale of our equity securities, through additional debt financing, from development and licensing arrangements, or the sale of assets. We may be unable to raise such additional capital on favorable terms, or at all. If we raise additional capital by selling our equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of our shareholders' equity positions.\nOur success is dependent in large part upon the continued services of our Chief Executive Officer and senior management with whom we do not have employment agreements.\nOur success is dependent in large part upon the continued services of our President and Chief Executive Officer, James A. Schoeneck, and other members of our executive management team, and on our ability to attract and retain key management and operating personnel. We do not have agreements with Mr. Schoeneck or any of our other executive officers that provide for their continued employment with us. We may have difficulty filling open senior commercial, scientific and financial positions. Management, scientific and operating personnel are in high demand in our industry and are often subject to competing offers. The loss of the services of one or more members of management or key employees or the inability to hire additional personnel as needed could result in delays in the research, development, and commercialization of our products and potential product candidates.\nProvisions in our restated articles of incorporation and bylaws and California law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and the California General Corporation Law could discourage a third party from acquiring, or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, control of our company without approval of our board of directors. These provisions could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Certain provisions allow the board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights superior to those of the common stock. We are also subject to the provisions of Section 1203 of the California General Corporation Law which requires a fairness opinion to be provided to our\nshareholders in connection with their consideration of any proposed \"interested party\" reorganization transaction.\nWe have adopted a shareholder rights plan, commonly known as a \"poison pill,\" which contains provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nIf we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal controls, our stock price could suffer.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires companies to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting. At the end of each fiscal year, we must perform an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, include in our annual report the results of the evaluation and have our external auditors also publicly attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If material weaknesses are found in our internal controls in the future, if we fail to complete future evaluations on time or if our external auditors cannot attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could fail to meet our regulatory reporting requirements and be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nChanges in fair value of contingent consideration and/or the liability for the unfavorable contract assumed as part of our acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations.\nContingent consideration obligations arise from the Zipsor\u00ae, CAMBIA\u00ae, and Lazanda\u00ae acquisitions and relate to the potential future milestone payments and royalties payable under the respective agreements. The liability for the unfavorable contract arose from the acquisition of CAMBIA\u00ae and represents the milestone payable to the vendor as well as the value of the amounts by which the contract terms are unfavorable compared to current market pricing. The contingent consideration and the liability for the unfavorable contract is initially recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date and is re-measured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The estimates of fair values for the contingent consideration and the unfavorable manufacturing contract contain uncertainties as it involves assumptions about the probability assigned to the potential milestones and royalties being achieved and the discount rate. Significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Updates to assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period.\nThe value of our deferred tax assets could become impaired, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had a significant amount of deferred tax assets, exclusive of a deferred tax liability for the convertible debt issuance. These deferred tax assets are principally comprised of state net operating loss carryovers and temporary differences related to intangible assets and other temporary differences that are expected to reverse in the future. We assess on a quarterly basis the probability of the realization of deferred tax assets, using significant judgments and estimates with respect to, among other things, the deferred tax liability as a source of income, historical operating results, expectations of future earnings and significant risks and uncertainties related to our business. If we determine in the future that there is not sufficient positive evidence to support the valuation of these assets, due to the risk factors described herein or other factors, we may be required to further adjust the valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. Such a reduction could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe investment of our cash is subject to risks, which may cause losses or adversely affect the liquidity of these investments and our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $488.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and $77.7 million in investments, of which $500.0 million was delivered to the Escrow Agent on January 15, 2015 as a deposit to be credited against the purchase price payable to Janssen Pharma upon the consummation of the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which have been and may, in the future, be exacerbated by a U.S. and/or global financial crisis. We may realize losses in the fair value of certain of our investments or a complete loss of these investments if the credit markets tighten, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur failure to generate sufficient cash flow from our business to make payments on our debt would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe incurred significant indebtedness in the aggregate principal amount of $345.0 million under our 2021 Notes. We will incur significant additional indebtedness in connection with obtaining the additional funds necessary to consummate the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance, the 2021 Notes and any additional debt obligations we may incur, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors that may be beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on commercially reasonable or acceptable terms, which could result in a default on our obligations, including the 2021 Notes.\nIn addition, our significant indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences to our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022 make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u2022 put us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt; and\n\u2022 limit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including funding possible acquisitions of, or investments in, additional products, technologies, and companies.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the 2021 Notes in cash or to repurchase the 2021 Notes upon a fundamental change.\nHolders of the 2021 Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2021 Notes upon the occurrence of certain events deemed to be a \"fundamental change\" at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the 2021 Notes, unless we elect to\ndeliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2021 Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of 2021 Notes surrendered therefore or pay cash with respect to 2021 Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2021 Notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase 2021 Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2021 Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. Moreover, the occurrence of a fundamental change under the indenture could constitute an event of default under any such agreements. If the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the 2021 Notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2021 Notes.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the 2021 Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2021 Notes is triggered, holders of 2021 Notes will be entitled to convert the 2021 Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their 2021 Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their 2021 Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 2021 Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the 2021 Notes could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn May 2008, FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (ASC 470-20). Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the 2021 Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer's economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the 2021 Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital within shareholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component would be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2021 Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense as a result of the accretion of the discounted carrying value of the 2021 Notes to their face amount over the term of the notes. We will report lower net income (or larger net losses) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the accretion of the debt discount and the instrument's non-convertible coupon interest rate, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition, if the 2021 Notes become convertible, we would be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 2021 Notes as a current rather than a long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. Finally, we use the if-converted method to compute diluted earnings per share with respect to\nour convertible debt, which could more dilutive than assuming the debt would be settled in cash as opposed to shares.\nAny of these factors could cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns on shares of our common stock will be limited to changes in the value of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock may be prohibited or limited by the terms of any future debt financing arrangement. Any return to shareholders will therefore be limited to the increase, if any, of our stock price.\nBusiness interruptions could limit our ability to operate our business.\nOur operations and infrastructure, and those of our partners, third party suppliers and vendors are vulnerable to damage or interruption from cyber attacks and security breaches, human error, natural disasters, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, intentional acts of theft, vandalism, terrorism and similar events. In particular, our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay area, which has a history of seismic activity. We have not established a formal disaster recovery plan, and our back-up operations and our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that occur. A significant business interruption could result in losses or damages incurred by us and require us to cease or curtail our operations.\nOur product revenues have historically been lower in the first quarter of the year as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur product revenues have historically been lower in the first quarter of the year as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year. We believe this arises primarily as a result of the reduction by our wholesalers of inventory of our products in the first quarter and annual changes in health insurance plans that occur at the beginning of the calendar year.\nIn 2012 and 2013, our wholesalers ended the calendar year with higher levels of inventory of our products than at the end of the first quarter of the following year. As a result, in the first quarter of 2013 and 2014, product shipments were lower than prescription demand and net sales decreased as a result of the reduction of product inventory at our wholesalers. Any material reduction by our wholesalers of their inventory of our products in the first quarter of any calendar year as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding calendar year, could adversely affect our operating results and may cause our stock price to decline.\nMany health insurance plans and government programs reset annual limits on deductibles and out-of-pocket costs at the beginning of each calendar year and require participants to pay for substantially all of the costs of medical services and prescription drug products until such deductibles and annual out-of-pocket cost limits are met. In addition, enrollment in high-deductible health insurance plans has increased significantly in recent years. As a result of these factors, patients may delay filling or refilling prescriptions for our products or substitute less expensive generic products until such deductibles and annual out-of-pocket cost limits are met. Any reduction in the demand for our products, including as a result of the foregoing factors, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe consummation of the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to consummate the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results.\nThe completion of the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, including (i) our obtaining financing, through one or more transactions, in an aggregate amount sufficient to pay the purchase price (minus the $500.0 cash deposit) and any related fees and expenses and (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. The completion of the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition is not certain and is subject to risks, including the risk that we are unable to obtain financing for the remainder of the purchase price, the approval of governmental agencies is not obtained or that other closing conditions are not satisfied.\nIf the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition is not consummated, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having consummated the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022 if the acquisition agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay to Janssen Pharma a termination fee equal to $73.5 million;\n\u2022 the current price of our common stock may reflect a market assumption that the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition will occur, meaning that a failure to complete the acquisition could result in a decline in the price of our common stock; and\n\u2022 matters relating to the acquisition have required and will continue to require substantial commitments of time and resources by management, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us.\nWe also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to consummate the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition or to perform our obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement, or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us. If the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition is not consummated, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect our business, financial results and stock price.\nAdditional financing we intend to obtain to consummate the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition will cause us to incur a significant amount of additional indebtedness and may negatively impact our shareholders' equity position and subject us to restrictive operating and financial covenants.\nIn order to consummate the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition, we expect to raise at least $550.0 million of capital (net of fees) through the sale of our equity or equity-linked securities or through debt financing or a combination of debt and equity financing. The issuance of such securities may be highly dilutive, or otherwise disadvantageous, to existing shareholders or subject us to restrictive operating and financial covenants. Such financing may not be available on commercially reasonable or acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure to raise capital when needed and on acceptable terms may require us to reduce our costs and expenses and would limit our ability to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated circumstances and to continue operations. Any one of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will incur substantial transaction-related costs in connection with the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with consummating the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition and integrating the businesses and operations related to NUCYNTA\u00ae. There are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of integration expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are currently difficult to estimate accurately. Due to these factors, if we are unable to consummate the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition and realize the benefits thereof, the transaction and integration expenses associated with the NUCYNTA\u00ae Acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 85686, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ASRT"}
