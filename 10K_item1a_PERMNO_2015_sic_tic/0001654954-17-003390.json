{"cik": "1282224", "company": "DOLPHIN DIGITAL MEDIA INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-17", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Related to our Business and Financial Condition\nOur independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our independent auditors issued an explanatory paragraph in their audit report expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern based upon our net loss and negative cash flows from operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and our levels of working capital as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Management is planning to raise any necessary additional funds to fund our operating expenses through loans and additional sales of our Common Stock, securities convertible into our Common Stock, debt securities or a combination of such financing alternatives; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising any necessary additional capital. If we are not successful in raising additional capital, we may not have enough financial resources to support our business and operations and, as a result, may not be able to continue as a going concern and could be forced to liquidate.\nWe have a history of net losses and may continue to incur net losses.\nWe have a history of net losses and may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability in the future. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, our net losses were $37,189,679. Our accumulated deficit was $99,812,204 at December 31, 2016. Our ability to generate net profit in the future will depend on our ability to successfully produce and commercialize multiple web series and films, as no single project is likely to generate sufficient revenue to cover our operating expenses. If we are unable to generate net profit at some point, we will not be able to meet our debt service requirements or our working capital requirements. As a result we may need to (i) issue additional equity, which could dilute the value of your share holdings, (ii) sell a portion or all of our assets, including any project rights which might have otherwise generated revenue, or (iii) cease operations.\nOur business requires a substantial investment of capital and failure to access sufficient capital while awaiting delayed revenues will have a material adverse effect on our results of operation.\nThe production, acquisition and distribution of film or digital media content require a significant amount of capital. The budget for the projects we plan to produce will require between $6 and $8 million to produce. In addition, if our distributor does not provide the funds for the distribution and marketing of our film, we will require additional capital to distribute and market the film. We estimate distribution and marketing fees to be approximately $10,000 per theatrical screen. A significant amount of time may elapse between our expenditure of funds and the receipt of revenues from our productions. We do not have a traditional credit facility with a financial institution on which to depend for our liquidity needs and a time lapse may require us to fund a significant portion of our capital requirements through related party transactions with our CEO or other financing sources. There can be no assurance that any additional financing resources will be available to us as and when required, or on terms that will be acceptable to us. Our inability to raise capital necessary to sustain our operations while awaiting delayed revenues would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nOur success is primarily dependent on audience acceptance of our films and digital media productions, which is extremely difficult to predict and, therefore, inherently risky.\nWe cannot predict the economic success of any of our films because the revenue derived from the distribution of a film (which does not necessarily directly correlate with the production or distribution costs incurred) depends primarily upon its acceptance by the public, which cannot be accurately predicted. The economic success of a film also depends upon the public\u2019s acceptance of competing films, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure-time activities, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty.\nThe economic success of a film is largely determined by our ability to produce content and develop stories and characters that appeal to a broad audience and by the effective marketing of the film. The theatrical performance of a film is a key factor in predicting revenue from post-theatrical markets. If we are unable to accurately judge audience acceptance of our film content or to have the film effectively marketed, the commercial success of the film will be in doubt, which could result in costs not being recouped or anticipated profits not being realized. Moreover, we cannot assure you that any particular feature film will generate enough revenue to offset its distribution, fulfillment services and marketing costs, in which case we would not receive any revenues for such film from our distributors.\nIn addition, changing consumer tastes affect our ability to predict which digital media productions will be popular with web audiences. As we invest in various digital projects, stars and directors, it is highly likely that at least some of the digital projects in which we invest will not appeal to our target audiences. If we are unable to produce web content that appeals to our target audiences the costs of such digital media productions could exceed revenues generated and anticipated profits may not be realized. Our failure to realize anticipated profits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may incur significant write-offs if our feature films and other projects do not perform well enough to recoup production, marketing, distribution and other costs.\nWe are required to amortize capitalized production costs over the expected revenue streams as we recognize revenue from our films or other projects. The amount of production costs that will be amortized each quarter depends on, among other things, how much future revenue we expect to receive from each project. Unamortized production costs are evaluated for impairment each reporting period on a project-by-project basis. If estimated remaining revenue is not sufficient to recover the unamortized production costs, the unamortized production costs will be written down to fair value. In any given quarter, if we lower our previous forecast with respect to total anticipated revenue from any individual feature film or other project, we may be required to accelerate amortization or record impairment charges with respect to the unamortized costs, even if we have previously recorded impairment charges for such film or other project. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $2 million impairment of the capitalized production costs for our feature film, Max Steel. Such impairment charges have had and in the future could have, a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn the past, we purchased several scripts and project ideas for our digital media productions totaling approximately $0.6 million that failed to generate interest among distributors or advertisers. As a result of the write off of the costs incurred in purchasing such scripts and project ideas, our operating results were negatively impacted.\nOur business is currently substantially dependent upon the success of a limited number of film releases and digital media productions each year and the unexpected delay or commercial failure of any one of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows.\nWe generally expect to release one to two feature films and one digital production in the next year. The unexpected delay in release or commercial failure of just one of these films or digital media productions could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows in both the year of release and in the future. Historically, feature films that are successful in the domestic theatrical market are generally also successful in the international theatrical and ancillary markets, although each film is different and there is no way to guarantee such results. If our films fail to achieve domestic box office success, their success in the international box office and ancillary markets and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Further, we can make no assurances that the historical correlation between results in the domestic box office and results in the international box office and ancillary markets will continue in the future. If our feature films do not perform well in the domestic or international theatrical markets and ancillary markets, or our digital media productions do not perform as anticipated, the failure of any one of these could a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows.\nDelays, cost overruns, cancellation or abandonment of the completion or release of our web series or films may have an adverse effect on our business.\nThere are substantial financial risks relating to production, completion and release of web series and films. Actual costs may exceed their budgets due to factors such as labor disputes, unavailability of a star performer, equipment shortages, disputes with production teams or adverse weather conditions, any of which may cause cost overruns and delay or hamper film completion. We are typically responsible for paying all production costs in accordance with a budget and receive a fixed producer\u2019s fee for our services plus a portion of any project income. However to the extent that delays or cost overruns result in us not completing the web series or film within budget, there may not be enough funds left to pay us our producer\u2019s fee, to generate any project income or complete the project at all. If this were to occur, it would significantly and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nOur management has determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective and we have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting.\nIn connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective and we identified several material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of December 31, 2016, we concluded that our disclosure control and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting were not effective due to the following material weaknesses:\n\u25cf\nDesign deficiencies related to the entity level control environment, including risk assessment, information and communication and monitoring controls:\no\nThere is no documented fraud risk assessment or risk management oversight function.\no\nThere are no documented procedures related to financial reporting matters (both internal and external) to the appropriate parties.\no\nThere is no budget prepared and therefore monitoring controls are not designed effectively as current results cannot be compared to expectations.\no\nThere is no documented process to monitor and remediate deficiencies in internal controls.\n\u25cf\nInadequate documented review and approval of certain aspects of the accounting process including the documented review of accounting reconciliations and journal entries that they considered to be a material weakness in internal control. Specifically:\no\nThere is no documented period end closing procedures, specifically the individuals that are responsible for preparation, review and approval of period end close functions\no\nReconciliations are performed on all balance sheet accounts, including noncontrolling interest on at least a quarterly basis; however there is no documented review and approval by a member of management that is segregated from the period end financial reporting process.\no\nThere is no review and approval for the posting of journal entries.\n\u25cf\nInadequate segregation of duties within the accounting process, including the following:\no\nOne individual has the ability to add vendors to the master vendor file. This individual also has access to the Company checkbook that is maintained in a secured location.\no\nOne individual has sole access to our information technology system to initiate, process and record financial information. We have not developed any internal controls related to information technology systems including change management, physical security, access or program development.\nEach of the material weaknesses described above could result in a misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses described above or avoid potential future material weaknesses. If we are unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, our stock price could be negatively impacted and we could be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC.\nWe rely on third party distributors to distribute our films and their failure to perform or promote our films could negatively impact our ability to generate revenues and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur films are primarily distributed and marketed by third party distributors. If any of these third party distributors fails to perform under their respective arrangements, such failure could negatively impact the success of our films and have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and ability to generate revenues.\nWe generally do not control the timing and manner in which our distributors distribute our films; their decisions regarding the timing of release and promotional support are important in determining success. Any decision by those distributors not to distribute or promote one of our films or to promote our competitors\u2019 films or related products to a greater extent than they promote ours could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows and operating results.\nWe rely on third party relationships with online digital platforms for our advertising revenue and we may be unable to secure such relationships.\nWe anticipate entering into distribution agreements containing revenue share provisions with online digital platforms to distribute our digital media productions. Pursuant to these revenue share provisions, we will earn a portion of advertising revenues once our digital media productions are distributed online. If we fail to secure such relationships with online digital platforms, we will not be able to earn advertising revenues from our digital projects, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations. In addition, some of our distributors have moved from an advertisement-based model to a subscription-based model which makes it more difficult for us to use our funding and distribution methods.\nWe may be unable to attract or retain advertisers, which could negatively impact our results of operation.\nTypically, online digital platforms are responsible for securing advertisers and, as such, our ability to earn advertising revenues would depend on their success in doing so. However, at times we have, and may continue to, proactively secure advertising commitments against anticipated web series. Our ability to retain advertisers is contingent on our ability to successfully complete and deliver online projects which are commercially successful, which we may fail to do. Advertising revenues could also be adversely impacted by factors outside our control such as failure of our digital media productions to attract our target viewer audiences, lack of future demand for our digital media productions, the inability of third party online digital platforms to deliver ads in an effective manner, competition for advertising revenue from existing competitors or new digital media companies, declines in advertising rates, adverse legal developments relating to online advertising, including legislative and regulatory developments and developments in litigation. The existence of any of these factors could result in a decrease of our anticipated advertising revenues.\nOur success depends on the services of our CEO.\nOur success greatly depends on the skills, experience and efforts of our CEO, Mr. O\u2019Dowd. We have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. O\u2019Dowd, however, this agreement cannot assure us of his continued services. If Mr. O\u2019Dowd resigns or becomes unable to continue in his present role and is not adequately replaced, the loss of his services could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur kids clubs depend on sponsorship donations to generate revenue.\nWe generate revenues from our online kids clubs through a portion of the sale of memberships to various donors. Donors typically sponsor a school for $10,000 which entitles each child in the school to receive an annual online kids club membership and entitles the school to receive a Reading Oasis. Receipt of sponsorship donations are unpredictable and depend on a number of factors such as our ability to successfully brand, market and implement the online kids clubs as well as local and international business and economic conditions.\nRisks Related to the Industry\nThe popularity and commercial success of our digital media productions and films are subject to numerous factors, over which we may have limited or no control.\nThe popularity and commercial success of our digital media productions and films depends on many factors including, but not limited to, the key talent involved, the timing of release, the promotion and marketing of the digital media production or film, the quality and acceptance of other competing productions released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment, general economic conditions, the genre and specific subject matter of the digital media production or film, its critical acclaim and the breadth, timing and format of its initial release. We cannot predict the impact of such factors on any digital media production or film, and many are factors that are beyond our control. As a result of these factors and many others, our digital media productions and films may not be as successful as we anticipate, and as a result, our results of operations may suffer.\nThe creation of content for the entertainment industry is highly competitive and we will be competing with companies with much greater resources than we have.\nThe business in which we engage is highly competitive. Our primary business operations are subject to competition from companies which, in many instances, have greater development, production and distribution and capital resources than us. We compete for the services of writers, producers, directors, actors and other artists to produce our digital media and motion picture content, as well as for advertisement dollars. Larger companies have a broader and more diverse selection of scripts than we do, which translates to a greater probability that they will be able to more closely fit the demands and interests of advertisers than we can.\nAs a small independent producer we compete with major U.S. and international studios. Most of the major U.S. studios are part of large diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations that can provide both the means of distributing their products and stable sources of earnings that may allow them better to offset fluctuations in the financial performance of their film and other operations. In addition, the major studios have more resources with which to compete for ideas, storylines and scripts created by third parties, as well as for actors, directors and other personnel required for production. Such competition for the industry\u2019s talent and resources may negatively affect our ability to acquire, develop, produce, advertise and distribute digital media and motion picture content.\nWe must successfully respond to rapid technological changes and alternative forms of delivery or storage to remain competitive.\nThe entertainment industry continues to undergo significant developments as advances in technologies and new methods of product delivery and storage, and certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these developments emerge. New technologies affect the demand for our content, the manner in which our content is distributed to consumers, the sources and nature of competing content offerings and the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view our content. We and our distributors must adapt our businesses to shifting patterns of content consumption and changing consumer behavior and preferences through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. If we cannot successfully exploit these and other emerging technologies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nWe have and may in the future be adversely affected by union activity.\nWe retain the services of actors who are covered by collective bargaining agreements with Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (\u201cSAG-AFTRA\u201d) and we may also become signatories to certain guilds such as Directors Guild of America and Writers Guild of America in order to allow us to hire directors and talent for our productions. Collective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of these agreements. In addition, our digital projects fall within SAG-AFTRA\u2019s definition of \u201cnew media\u201d, which is an emerging category covered by its New Media and Interactive Media Agreements for actors. As such, our ability to retain actors is subject to uncertainties that arise from SAG-AFTRA\u2019s administration of this relatively new category of collective bargaining agreements. Such uncertainties have resulted and may continue to result in delays in production of our digital projects.\nIn addition, if negotiations to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements are not successful or become unproductive, the union could take actions such as strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages. Strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages or the possibility of such actions could result in delays in production of our digital projects. We could also incur higher costs from such actions, new collective bargaining agreements or the renewal of collective bargaining agreements on less favorable terms. Depending on their duration, union activity or labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOthers may assert intellectual property infringement claims or liability claims for digital media or film content against us which may force us to incur substantial legal expenses.\nThere is a possibility that others may claim that our productions and production techniques, or those of Dolphin Films, misappropriate or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties with respect to their previously developed web series, stories, characters, other entertainment or intellectual property. In addition, as distributors of digital media and film content, we may face potential liability for such claims as defamation, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of the materials distributed. If successfully asserted, our insurance may not be adequate to cover any of the foregoing claims. Irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims, we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources in defending against them, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights adequately, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to compete depends, in part, upon successful protection of our intellectual property. We attempt to protect proprietary and intellectual property rights to our productions through available copyright and trademark laws and distribution arrangements with companies for limited durations. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our intellectual property or to obtain and use property that we regard as proprietary. We cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States. Intellectual property protections may also be unavailable, limited or difficult to enforce in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to steal our intellectual property. Our failure to protect adequately our intellectual property and proprietary rights could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur online activities are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to privacy and child protection, which, if violated, could subject us to an increased risk of litigation and regulatory actions.\nIn addition to our company websites and applications, we use third-party applications, websites, and social media platforms to promote our digital media productions and engage consumers, as well as monitor and collect certain information about users of our online forums. A variety of laws and regulations have been adopted in recent years aimed at protecting children using the internet such as the Children\u2019s Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998 (\u201cCOPPA\u201d). COPPA sets forth, among other things, a number of restrictions on what website operators can present to children under the age of 13 and what information can be collected from them. There are also a variety of laws and regulations governing individual privacy and the protection and use of information collected from such individuals, particularly in relation to an individual\u2019s personally identifiable information (e.g., credit card numbers). Many foreign countries have adopted similar laws governing individual privacy, including safeguards which relate to the interaction with children. If our online activities were to violate any applicable current or future laws and regulations, we could be subject to litigation and regulatory actions, including fines and other penalties.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock and Preferred Stock\nWe have recently issued, and may in the future issue, a significant amount of equity securities and, as a result, your ownership interest in the Company has been, and may in the future be, substantially diluted and your investment in our Common Stock could suffer a material decline in value.\nFrom January 1, 2016 to April 17, 2017, the number of shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding has increased from 4,094,618 (adjusted for a 20:1 reverse stock split on May 10, 2016) to 18,755,865 shares. Of this amount, approximately 5,665,760 shares of Common Stock have been issued in private placements as payment to certain holders of the Company\u2019s debt pursuant to debt exchange agreements. Consequently, we have not received any cash proceeds in connection with such issuances of Common Stock. In addition, 1,525,000 shares of Common Stock were issued in private placements pursuant to subscription agreements. Generally, these subscription agreements and debt exchange agreements provide for past or future purchases of, or exchanges of debt for, our Common Stock at a price of $5.00 per share which, upon each exercise or exchange thus far, has been below the market price of our Common Stock. In addition, during 2016, the Company issued Warrants G, H, I, J and K. Warrants G, H and I are exercisable for an aggregate of 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock at exercise prices ranging from $5.00 to $7.00 per share. Warrants J and K were issued in exchange for debt and to purchase the remaining membership interests in Dolphin Kids Club and were exercised for an aggregate of 2,340,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.15 per share. Furthermore, as consideration for our recent 42West Acquisition, we (i) issued 1,230,280 shares of Common Stock on the closing date, (ii) will issue (a) 344,550 shares of Common Stock to certain employees within 30 days of the closing date, (b) 118,655 shares of Common Stock as bonuses during 2017 and (c) approximately 1,961,821 shares of Common Stock on January 2, 2018 and (iii) may issue approximately 1,963,126 shares of Common Stock based on the achievement of specified financial performance targets over a three-year period. As a result of these issuances, your ownership interest in the Company has been, and may in the future be, substantially diluted. The market price for our Common Stock has been volatile in the past, and these issuances could cause the price of our Common Stock to fluctuate substantially in the future. In addition, we have historically experienced significantly low trading volumes. Once restricted stock issued in the private placements and in the 42West Acquisition becomes freely tradable, these current or future shareholders may decide to trade their shares of Common Stock and, if our stock is thinly traded, this could have a material adverse effect on its market price.\nIn the near term, we will need to raise additional capital and may seek to do so by conducting one or more private placements of equity securities, securities convertible into equity securities or debt securities, selling additional securities in a registered public offering, or through a combination of one or more of such financing alternatives. Such issuances of additional securities would further dilute the equity interests of our existing shareholders, perhaps substantially, and may further exacerbate any or all of the above risks.\nThe Series C Convertible Preferred Stock has anti-dilution protections and super voting rights that may adversely affect our shareholders.\nFor a period of five years from March 7, 2016, the date of issuance, the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock will have certain anti-dilution protections. Upon triggers specified in its Certificate of Designation, the number of shares of Common Stock into which Series C Convertible Preferred Stock held by Mr. O\u2019Dowd (or any entity directly or indirectly controlled by Mr. O\u2019Dowd) can be converted will be increased, such that the total number of shares of Common Stock held by Mr. O\u2019Dowd (or any entity directly or indirectly controlled by Mr. O\u2019Dowd) (based on the number of shares of Common Stock held as of the date of issuance) will be preserved at the same percentage of shares of Common Stock outstanding currently held by such persons, which was approximately 53% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding. As a result, your ownership interests may be further diluted.\nIn addition, as a holder of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, Mr. O\u2019Dowd also has super voting rights of three votes per preferred share. Holders of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote together as a single class on all matters upon which Common Stock holders are entitled to vote. Your voting rights will be diluted as a result of these super voting rights. In addition, anti-dilution protections, described below, may result in an increase in the number of shares of Common Stock into which Series C Convertible Preferred Stock held by Mr. O\u2019Dowd and certain eligible persons can be converted, which could further dilute your percentage of voting rights.\nAs long as we are an issuer of \u201cpenny stock,\u201d we are subject to penny stock regulations and the protection provided by the federal securities laws relating to forward-looking statements does not apply to us, which could subject us to potentially costly legal action.\nBroker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks are regulated by certain penny stock rules adopted by the SEC. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer\u2019s presumed control over the market and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. In addition, broker-dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally, those persons with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 to $300,000 together with their spouse), must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. Consequently, these requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that is or becomes subject to the penny stock rules. To the extent our stock price falls below $5.00 per share, we are subject to the penny stock rules, and consequently, our shareholders will find it more difficult to sell their shares. Consequently, the penny stock regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operation. In addition, although federal securities laws provide a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by a public company that files reports under the federal securities laws, this safe harbor is not available to issuers of penny stocks. As a result, for as long as we are a penny stock, we will not have the benefit of this safe harbor protection in the event of any legal action based upon a claim that the material provided by us contained a material misstatement of fact or was misleading in any material respect because of our failure to include any statements necessary to make the statements not misleading.\nOur Common Stock is quoted only on the OTC Market Pink Sheets, which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.\nOur Common Stock is quoted on the OTC Market Pink Sheets. The OTC Market Pink Sheets is a significantly more limited market than the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ system. The quotation of our shares on the OTC Market may result in an illiquid market available for existing and potential shareholders to trade shares of our Common Stock and depress the trading price of our Common Stock, and may have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions\nWe are subject to risks associated with acquisitions and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions.\nWe have in the past completed acquisitions, and may in the future engage in discussions and activities with respect to possible acquisitions, intended to complement or expand our business, some of which may be significant transactions for us. For example, in March 2016, we acquired Dolphin Films, a content producer of motion pictures, and on March 30, 2017 we acquired 42West, a full-service entertainment marketing agency. Identifying suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to identify suitable candidates or complete acquisitions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis or at all.\nEven if we complete an acquisition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such transaction. Our recent acquisitions have required, and any similar future transactions may also require, significant efforts and expenditures, including with respect to integrating the acquired business with our historical business. We may encounter unexpected difficulties, or incur unexpected costs, in connection with acquisition activities and integration efforts, which include:\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management attention from managing our historical core business;\n\u25cf\npotential disruption of our historical core business or of the acquired business;\n\u25cf\nthe strain on, and need to continue to expand, our existing operational, technical, financial and administrative infrastructure;\n\u25cf\ninability to achieve synergies as planned;\n\u25cf\nchallenges in controlling additional costs and expenses in connection with and as a result of the acquisition;\n\u25cf\ndilution to existing shareholders from the issuance of equity securities;\n\u25cf\nbecoming subject to adverse tax consequences or substantial depreciation;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in assimilating employees and corporate cultures or in integrating systems and controls;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in anticipating and responding to actions that may be taken by competitors;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in realizing the anticipated benefits of the transaction;\n\u25cf\ninability to generate sufficient revenue from acquisitions to offset the associated acquisition costs;\n\u25cf\npotential loss of key employees, key clients or other partners of the acquired business as a result of the change of ownership; and\n\u25cf\nthe assumption of and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired businesses.\nIf any of our acquisitions do not perform as anticipated for any of the reasons noted above or otherwise, there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny due diligence by us in connection with potential future acquisition may not reveal all relevant considerations or liabilities of the target business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe intend to conduct such due diligence as we deem reasonably practicable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to any potential acquisition. The objective of the due diligence process will be to identify material issues which may affect the decision to proceed with any one particular acquisition target or the consideration payable for an acquisition. We also intend to use information revealed during the due diligence process to formulate our business and operational planning for, and our valuation of, any target company or business. While conducting due diligence and assessing a potential acquisition, we may rely on publicly available information, if any, information provided by the relevant target company to the extent such company is willing or able to provide such information and, in some circumstances, third party investigations.\nThere can be no assurance that the due diligence undertaken with respect to an acquisition, including the Dolphin Films Acquisition or the 42West Acquisition, will reveal all relevant facts that may be necessary to evaluate such acquisition including the determination of the price we may pay for an acquisition target or to formulate a business strategy. Furthermore, the information provided during due diligence may be incomplete, inadequate or inaccurate. As part of the due diligence process, we will also make subjective judgments regarding the results of operations, financial condition and prospects of a potential target. For example, the due diligence we conducted in connection with the Dolphin Films Acquisition and the 42West Acquisition may not have been complete, adequate or accurate and may not have uncovered all material issues and liabilities to which we are now subject. If the due diligence investigation fails to correctly identify material issues and liabilities that may be present in a target company or business, or if we consider such material risks to be commercially acceptable relative to the opportunity, and we proceed with an acquisition, we may subsequently incur substantial impairment charges or other losses.\nIn addition, following an acquisition, including the Dolphin Films Acquisition and the 42West Acquisition, we may be subject to significant, previously undisclosed liabilities of the acquired business that were not identified during due diligence and which could contribute to poor operational performance, undermine any attempt to restructure the acquired company or business in line with our business plan and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nClaims against us relating to any acquisition may necessitate our seeking claims against the seller for which the seller may not indemnify us or that may exceed the seller\u2019s indemnification obligations.\nAs discussed above, there may be liabilities assumed in any acquisition that we did not discover or that we underestimated in the course of performing our due diligence. Although a seller generally will have indemnification obligations to us under an acquisition or merger agreement, these obligations usually will be subject to financial limitations, such as general deductibles and maximum recovery amounts, as well as time limitations, as was the case in the 42West Acquisition. We cannot assure you that our right to indemnification from any seller will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the amount of any undiscovered or underestimated liabilities that we may incur. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to the 42West Business\nOur business could be adversely affected if we fail to retain the Principal Sellers ,other key employees and the clients they represent\nThe success of the 42West business substantially depends on our ability to retain the services of the Principal Sellers.. If we lose the services of one or more of these individuals, our ability to successfully implement our business plan with respect to the newly acquired business and the value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. Although we entered into three-year employment agreements with each of the Principal Sellers in connection with the 42West Acquisition, there can be no assurance that they will serve the term of their employment agreements or choose to remain with us following the expiration of such terms. In addition, the employees of 42West, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among 42West\u2019s most valuable assets. An important aspect of the business\u2019 competitiveness is its ability to retain these key employees. If 42West fails to hire and retain a sufficient number of these key employees, it may have a material adverse effect on our overall business and results of operations.\n42West\u2019s talent roster currently includes some of the best known and most highly respected members of the entertainment community in addition to major studios and networks, corporations and well-known consumer brands. These clients often form highly loyal relationships with certain public relations and marketing professionals rather than with a particular firm. The employment agreements with the Principal Sellers currently contain non-competition provisions that will prevent the Principal Sellers from continuing to provide services to such clients should they leave the Company , however, clients are free to engage other public relations and marketing professionals and there can be no assurance that they will choose to remain with our Company. The success of the 42West Acquisition, therefore, depends on our ability to continue to successfully maintain such client relationships should the Principal Sellers or other key employees leave our Company. If we are unable to retain the current 42West clients or attract new clients, we may lose all of the benefits of the acquisition which would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n42West operates in a highly competitive industry.\nThe entertainment marketing business is highly competitive. 42West must compete with other agencies, and with other providers of entertainment marketing services, in order to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients. The client\u2019s perception of the quality of an agency\u2019s creative work and the agency\u2019s reputation are critical factors in determining its competitive position.\nThe success of the 42West business depends on its ability to consistently and effectively deliver marketing and public relations services to its clients.\n42West\u2019s success depends on its ability to effectively and consistently staff and execute client engagements to achieve the clients\u2019 unique personal or professional goals. 42West works to design customized communications or publicity campaigns tailored to the particular needs and objectives of particular projects. In some of its engagements, 42West relies on other third parties to provide some of the services to its clients, and we cannot guarantee that these third parties will effectively deliver their services or that we will have adequate recourse against these third parties in the event they fail to effectively deliver their services. Other contingencies and events outside of our control may also impact 42West\u2019s ability to provide its services. 42West\u2019s failure to effectively and timely staff, coordinate and execute its client engagements may adversely impact existing client relationships, the amount or timing of payments from clients, its reputation in the marketplace and ability to secure additional business and our resulting financial performance. In addition, our contractual arrangements with our clients may not provide us with sufficient protections against claims for lost profits or other claims for damages.\nIf we are unable to adapt to changing client demands, social and cultural trends or emerging technologies, we may not remain competitive and our business, revenues and operating results could suffer.\nWe operate in an industry characterized by rapidly changing client expectations, marketing technologies, and social mores and cultural trends that impact our target audiences. The entertainment industry continues to undergo significant developments as advances in technologies and new methods of message delivery and consumption emerge. These developments drive changes in our target audiences\u2019 behavior to which we must adapt in order to reach our target audiences. In addition, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing social mores and cultural trends that impact the entertainment industry and our target audiences. We must adapt our business to these trends, as well as shifting patterns of content consumption and changing behaviors and preferences of our target audiences, through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. If we cannot successfully exploit emerging technologies or if the marketing strategies we choose misinterpret cultural or social trends and prove to be incorrect or ineffective, any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nA significant labor dispute in our clients\u2019 industries could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAn industry-wide strike or other job action by or affecting the Writers Guild, Screen Actors Guild or other major entertainment industry union could reduce the supply of original entertainment content, which would in turn reduce the demand for our talent and entertainment marketing services. An extensive work stoppage would affect feature film production as well as television and commercial production and could have a material adverse effect on our clients and the motion picture production industry in general. For example, on November 5, 2007, the Writers Guild declared a strike affecting the script writing for television shows and films. The strike, which lasted until February 12, 2008, significantly affected the entertainment industry which consequently, had a material adverse impact on revenue generated by public relations and entertainment marketing agencies. Contracts between entertainment industry unions and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (\u201cAMPTP\u201d) expire from time to time. The failure to finalize and ratify a new agreement with the AMPTP or the failure to enter into new commercial contracts upon expiration of the current contracts could lead to a strike or other job action. Any such severe or prolonged work stoppage could have an adverse effect on the television and/or motion picture production industries and could severely impair our clients\u2019 prospects. Any resulting decrease in demand for our talent and entertainment marketing and other public relations services would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.\nClients may terminate or reduce their relationships with us on short notice.\n42West\u2019s entertainment clients may choose to reduce their relationships with us, on a relatively short time frame and for any reason and can terminate their contracts with us with 30 days\u2019 notice. If a significant number of the 42West clients were to terminate their relationships with us, this could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations.\n42West\u2019s ability to generate new business from new and existing clients may be limited.\nTo increase its revenues, 42West needs to obtain additional clients or generate demand for additional services from existing clients. 42West\u2019s ability to generate initial demand for its services from new clients and additional demand from existing clients is subject to such clients\u2019 and potential clients\u2019 requirements, trends in the entertainment industry, financial conditions, strategic plans and internal resources of corporate clients, as well as the quality of 42West\u2019s employees, services and reputation. To the extent 42West cannot generate new business from new and existing clients due to these limitations, the ability of 42West to grow its business, and of the Company to increase its revenues, will be limited.\n42West\u2019s revenues are susceptible to declines as a result of unfavorable economic conditions.\nEconomic downturns often severely affect the marketing services industry. Some of our corporate clients may respond to weak economic performance by reducing their marketing budgets, which are generally discretionary in nature and easier to reduce in the short-term than other expenses related to operations. In addition, economic downturns could lead to reduced public demand for varying forms of entertainment for which we are engaged to provide public relations and media strategy and promotional services. Such reduced demand for our services could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\n42West relies on information technology systems and could face cybersecurity risks.\n42West relies on information technologies and infrastructure to manage its business, including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information and delivery of digital marketing services. The incidence of malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks or other malicious activities is on the rise worldwide. Power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities or human error may also affect our systems and result in disruption of our services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information or other confidential information.\nLikewise, data privacy breaches, as well as improper use of social media, by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information, strategic plans and trade secrets, could be exposed to third parties or to the general public. 42West also utilizes third parties, including third-party \u201ccloud\u201d computing services, to store, transfer or process data, and system failures or network disruptions or breaches in the systems of such third parties could adversely affect its reputation or business. Any such breaches or breakdowns could expose us to legal liability, be expensive to remedy, result in a loss of clients or clients\u2019 proprietary information and damage our reputation. Efforts to develop, implement and maintain security measures are costly, may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated.", "PERMNO": 17140, "SIC": 8700, "TIC": "DLPN"}
