{"cik": "850429", "company": "TREDEGAR CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The following risk factors should be considered, in addition to the other information included in this Form 10-K, when evaluating Tredegar and its businesses.\nPE Films\n\u2022\nPE Films is highly dependent on sales associated with its top five customers, the largest of which is P&G. PE Films\u2019 top five customers comprised approximately 21%, 26% and 29% of Tredegar\u2019s consolidated net sales, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, with net sales to P&G alone comprising approximately 10%, 13% and 16% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The loss or significant reduction of sales associated with one or more of these customers without replacement by new business could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Other factors that could adversely affect the business include, by way of example, (i) failure by a key customer to achieve success or maintain share in markets in which they sell products containing PE Films\u2019 materials, (ii) key customers using products developed by others that replace PE Films\u2019 business with such customer, (iii) delays in a key customer rolling out products utilizing new technologies developed by PE Films and (iv) operational decisions by a key customer that result in component substitution, inventory reductions and similar changes. While PE Films is undertaking efforts to expand its customer base, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful, or that they will offset any delay or loss of sales and profits associated with these large customers.\nIn recent years, PE Films lost substantial sales volume due to product transitions and incurred other sales losses associated with various customers. During October 2018, the Personal Care component of PE Films completed negotiations with a customer regarding a previously disclosed significant product transition. The total annual sales that will be adversely impacted by this product transition is approximately $70 million. During 2019, the Company expects sales for the product of $30 to $35 million with the potential for no sales thereafter. Any actions that the Company takes to reduce fixed costs to partially mitigate the decline in variable contribution that will accompany the decline in sales will depend on the level of success that Personal Care has with replacing the lost business with new products and business.\nPersonal Care has increased its annual R&D spending by approximately $5 million since 2014, reaching $12 million in 2018. Personal Care is also investing capital and is accelerating sales and marketing efforts to capture growth and diversify its customer base and product offerings in personal care products, but there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or that they will offset any loss of business due to product transitions.\nThe Personal Care component of PE Films had operating profit from ongoing operations plus depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter of 2018 of $3.1 million. As a result of the decline in sales from the significant product transition discussed above, the Company expects operating profit from ongoing operations plus depreciation and amortization for this component of approximately negative $1.5 million during the first half of 2019. Personal Care projects its operating profit from ongoing operations plus depreciation and amortization to turn positive in the second half of 2019 assuming production and sales growth targets are achieved.\nPE Films also anticipates that a portion of its film used in surface protection applications will be made obsolete by future customer product transitions to less costly alternative processes or materials. These transitions could possibly be fully implemented by the fourth quarter of 2019. When fully implemented, the Company estimates that the annualized adverse impact on future operating profit from this customer shift will be approximately $11 million. In response, the Company is aggressively pursuing new surface protection products, applications and customers, but there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or that they will offset any loss of business due to product transitions.\n\u2022\nPE Films and its customers operate in highly competitive markets. PE Films competes on product innovation, quality, price and service, and its businesses and their customers operate in highly competitive markets. Global market conditions continue to exacerbate the Company\u2019s exposure to margin compression due to competitive forces, especially as certain products move into the later stages of their product life cycles. In addition, the changing dynamics of consumer products retailing, including the impact of on-line retailers such as Amazon, is creating price and margin pressure on the customers of PE Films\u2019 personal care business. While PE Films continually works to identify new business opportunities with new and existing customers, primarily through the development of new products with improved performance and/or cost characteristics, there can be no assurances that such efforts will be successful or that they will offset business lost from competitive dynamics or customer product transitions.\n\u2022\nOur cost saving initiatives may not achieve the results we anticipate. PE Films has undertaken and will continue to undertake cost reduction initiatives to consolidate certain production, improve operating efficiencies and generate cost savings. PE Films cannot be certain that it will be able to complete these initiatives as planned or that the estimated operating efficiencies or cost savings from such activities will be fully realized or maintained over time. In addition, PE\nFilms may not be successful in moving production to other facilities or timely qualifying new production equipment. Failure to complete these initiatives could adversely affect PE Films\u2019 financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nFailure of PE Films\u2019 customers, who are subject to cyclical downturns, to achieve success or maintain market share could adversely impact PE Films\u2019 sales and operating margins. PE Films\u2019 plastic films serve as components for, or are used in the production of, various consumer products sold worldwide. A customer\u2019s ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market those products is integral to PE Films\u2019 success. Also, consumers of premium products made with or using PE Films\u2019 components may shift to less premium or less expensive products, reducing the demand for PE Films\u2019 plastic films. Cyclical downturns may negatively affect businesses that use PE Films\u2019 plastic film products, which could adversely affect sales and operating margins.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s inability to protect its intellectual property rights or its infringement of the intellectual property rights of others could have a material adverse impact on PE Films. PE Films operates in an industry where its significant customers and competitors have substantial intellectual property portfolios. The continued success of PE Films\u2019 business depends on its ability not only to protect its own technologies and trade secrets, but also to develop and sell new products that do not infringe upon existing patents or threaten existing customer relationships. Intellectual property litigation is very costly and could result in substantial expense and diversions of Company resources, both of which could adversely affect its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, there may be no effective legal recourse against infringement of the Company\u2019s intellectual property by third parties, whether due to limitations on enforcement of rights in foreign jurisdictions or as a result of other factors.\n\u2022\nAn unstable economic environment could have a disruptive impact on PE Films\u2019 supply chain. Certain raw materials used in manufacturing PE Films\u2019 products are sourced from single suppliers, and PE Films may not be able to quickly or inexpensively re-source from other suppliers. The risk of damage or disruption to its supply chain may increase if and when different suppliers consolidate their product portfolios, experience financial distress or disruption of manufacturing operations (such as, for example, the impact of hurricanes on petrochemical production). Failure to take adequate steps to effectively manage such events, which are intensified when a product is procured from a single supplier or location, could adversely affect PE Films\u2019 consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to restore its supply chain.\nFlexible Packaging Films\n\u2022\nOvercapacity in Latin American polyester film production and a history of uncertain economic conditions in Brazil could adversely impact the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Flexible Packaging Films. Competition in Brazil, Terphane\u2019s primary market, has been exacerbated by global overcapacity in the polyester industry generally, and by particularly acute overcapacity in Latin America. Additional PET capacity from a competitor in Latin America came on line in 2017. These factors have resulted in significant competitive pricing pressures and U.S. Dollar equivalent margin compression.\nFor flexible packaging films produced in Brazil, costs for operations in Brazil have been adversely impacted by inflation in Brazil that is higher than in the U.S. Flexible Packaging Films is exposed to additional foreign exchange translation risk because almost 90% of Flexible Packaging Films\u2019 Brazilian sales are quoted or priced in U.S. Dollars while a large part of its Brazilian costs are quoted or priced in Brazilian Real. This mismatch, together with a variety of economic variables impacting currency exchange rates, causes volatility that could negatively or positively impact operating profit for Flexible Packaging Films. While Flexible Packaging Films hedges this exposure on a short-term basis with foreign exchange forward rate contracts, the exposure continues to exist beyond the hedging periods.\n\u2022\nGovernmental failure to extend anti-dumping duties in Brazil on imported products or prevent competitors from circumventing such duties could adversely impact Flexible Packaging Films. In recent years, excess global capacity in the industry has led to increased competitive pressures from imports into Brazil. The Company believes that these conditions have shifted the competitive environment from a regional to a global landscape and have driven price convergence and lower product margins for Flexible Packaging Films. Favorable anti-dumping rulings or countervailing duties are in effect for products imported from China, Egypt, India, Mexico, UAE and Turkey. In January 2018, the Brazilian government opened new anti-dumping investigations for products imported from Peru and Bahrain. Competitors not currently subject to anti-dumping duties may choose to utilize their excess capacity by selling product in Brazil, which may result in pricing pressures that Flexible Packaging Films may not be able to offset with cost savings measures and/or manufacturing efficiency initiatives. There can be no assurance that efforts to impose anti-dumping constraints on products imported to Brazil from Peru and Bahrain, or to extend duties beyond 2020 on products imported from certain other countries, will be successful.\nAluminum Extrusions\n\u2022\nSales volume and profitability of Aluminum Extrusions is cyclical and seasonal and highly dependent on economic conditions of end-use markets in the U.S., particularly in the construction sector. Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 end-use markets can be cyclical and subject to seasonal swings in volume. Because of the capital intensive nature and level of fixed costs inherent in the aluminum extrusions business, the percentage drop in operating profits in a cyclical downturn will likely exceed the percentage drop in volume. In addition, during an economic slowdown, excess industry capacity often drives increased pricing pressure in many end-use markets as competitors protect their position with key customers. Any benefits associated with cost reductions and productivity improvements may not be sufficient to offset the adverse effects on profitability from pricing and margin pressure and higher bad debts (including a greater chance of loss associated with customers defaulting on fixed-price forward sales contracts) that usually accompany a downturn. In addition, higher energy costs can further reduce profits unless offset by price increases or cost reductions and productivity improvements.\n\u2022\nFailure to prevent competitors from circumventing anti-dumping and countervailing duties, or a reduction in such duties, could adversely impact Aluminum Extrusions. As of April 2017, the antidumping duty and countervailing duty orders on aluminum extrusions from China will remain in place until the next five-year review of the orders. Chinese and other overseas manufacturers continue to try to circumvent the antidumping and countervailing orders to avoid duties. A failure by, or the inability of, U.S. trade officials to curtail efforts to circumvent these duties, or the potential reduction of applicable duties pursuant to annual reviews of the orders, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Aluminum Extrusions.\n\u2022\nThe imposition of tariffs or duties on imported aluminum products could significantly increase the price of Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 main raw material, which could adversely impact demand for its products. In March 2018, the U.S. imposed tariffs of 10% on aluminum ingot and semi-finished aluminum imported into the U.S. from certain countries, including countries from which Bonnell Aluminum has historically sourced aluminum supplies. These tariffs have increased the cost of aluminum ingot used by Bonnell Aluminum to make its products. For the vast majority of its business, Bonnell Aluminum expects to be able to pass through higher aluminum costs to customers. However, sustained higher costs for aluminum extrusions could result in reduced demand and product substitutions in place of aluminum extrusions, which could materially and negatively affect Bonnell Aluminum\u2019s business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nCompetition from China could increase significantly if China is granted market economy status by the World Trade Organization. China has launched a formal complaint at the World Trade Organization challenging its non-market economy status, claiming that as of December 11, 2016, China\u2019s transition period as a non-market economy under its Accession Protocol to the World Trade Organization ended. China believes with respect to all Chinese-made products that it should receive market economy status and the rights attendant to that status under World Trade Organization rules. The U.S. and the European Union have each rejected that interpretation. If China is granted market economy status, the extent to which the U.S. antidumping laws will be able to limit unfair trade practices from China will likely be limited because the U.S. government will be forced to utilize Chinese prices and costs that do not reflect market principles in antidumping duty investigations involving China, which could ultimately limit the level of antidumping duties applied to unfairly traded Chinese imports. The volume of unfairly traded imports of Chinese aluminum extrusions could increase as a result and this, in turn, would likely create substantial pricing pressure on Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 products and could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Aluminum Extrusions.\n\u2022\nThe markets for Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 products are highly competitive with product quality, service, delivery performance and price being the principal competitive factors. Aluminum Extrusions has approximately 1,400 customers that are in a variety of end-use markets within the broad categories of building and construction, distribution, automotive and other transportation, machinery and equipment, electrical and consumer durables. No single customer exceeds 4% of Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 net sales. Future success and prospects depend on Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 ability to provide superior service, high quality products, timely delivery and competitive pricing to retain existing customers and participate in overall industry cross-cycle growth. Failure in any of these areas could lead to a loss of customers, which could have an adverse material effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Aluminum Extrusions.\n\u2022\nAluminum Extrusions may not have sufficient capacity to meet its growth targets and service all of its customers. Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 ability to grow and service existing customers is closely tied to having sufficient capacity. In recent years, increased demand, primarily from the nonresidential building and construction sector, has substantially increased Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 average capacity utilization.\nGeneral\n\u2022\nThe Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2017 and 2018. The Company\u2019s failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures increases the risk of a material misstatement in its consolidated financial statements, and its failure to meet its reporting and financial obligations, which in turn could have a negative impact on its financial condition.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for the Company to produce reliable financial statements. As discussed in Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d the Company\u2019s management concluded that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2018, as a result of certain deficiencies that were determined to constitute material weaknesses in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nUnder standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), a material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Under the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, a material weakness in the design of monitoring controls indicates that the Company has not sufficiently developed and/or documented internal controls by which management can review and oversee the Company\u2019s financial information to detect and correct material errors or that the personnel responsible for performing the review did not have the sufficient skill set or knowledge of the subject matter to perform a proper assessment.\nAs discussed in Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d to remediate the material weaknesses, the Company, with the assistance of its outside consultant, is in the process of implementing certain changes to its internal controls and reviewing the entire control environment to help ensure that there are no other material weaknesses. The Company believes that its remediation plan will be sufficient to remediate the identified material weaknesses and strengthen its internal control over financial reporting. However, remediation of the identified material weaknesses and strengthening the Company\u2019s internal control environment will require a substantial effort throughout 2019, and those efforts may extend beyond 2019. As the Company continues to evaluate and work to improve its internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, management may determine to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify the remediation plan. The Company cannot assure you, however, when it will remediate such weaknesses, nor can it be certain of whether additional actions will be required or the costs of any such actions. Moreover, the Company cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future.\nWhile the material weaknesses discussed in Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d did not result in material misstatements of the Company\u2019s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2018, or any interim period during 2017 or 2018, any failure to remediate the material weaknesses, or the development of new material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, could result in material misstatements in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and cause it to fail to meet its reporting and financial obligations, which in turn could have a negative impact on its financial condition.\n\u2022\nTredegar has an underfunded defined benefit (pension) plan. Tredegar sponsors a pension plan that covers certain hourly and salaried employees in the U.S. The plan was substantially frozen to new participants in 2007, and frozen to benefit accruals for active participants in 2014. As of December 31, 2018, the plan was underfunded under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) measures by $81.9 million. Tredegar expects that it will be required to make a cash contribution of approximately $8.1 million to its underfunded pension plan in 2019, and may be required to make higher cash contributions in future periods depending on the level of interest rates and investment returns on plan assets.\n\u2022\nNoncompliance with any of the covenants in the Company\u2019s $400 million revolving credit facility, which matures in March of 2021, could result in all debt under the agreement outstanding at such time becoming due and limiting its borrowing capacity, which could have a material adverse effect on consolidated financial condition and liquidity. The credit agreement governing Tredegar\u2019s revolving credit facility contains restrictions and financial covenants that, if violated, could restrict the Company\u2019s operational and financial flexibility. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, would result in all outstanding debt under the credit facility at such time becoming due, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition and liquidity.\n\u2022\nTredegar\u2019s performance is influenced by costs incurred by its operating companies, including, for example, the cost of raw materials and energy. These costs include, without limitation, the cost of resin (the raw material on which PE Films primarily depends), PTA and MEG (the raw materials on which Flexible Packaging Films primarily depends), aluminum (the raw material on which Aluminum Extrusions primarily depends), natural gas (the principal fuel necessary for Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 plants to operate), electricity and diesel fuel. Resin, aluminum and natural gas prices are volatile as shown in the charts in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures section. The Company attempts to mitigate the effects of increased costs through price increases and contractual pass-through provisions, but there are no assurances that higher prices can effectively be passed through to customers or that Tredegar will be able to offset fully or on a timely basis the effects of higher raw material and energy costs through price increases or pass-through arrangements. Further, the Company\u2019s cost control efforts may not be sufficient to offset any increases in raw material, energy or other costs.\n\u2022\nTredegar may not be able to successfully integrate strategic acquisitions. Acquisitions involve special risks, including, without limitation, meeting revenue, margin, working capital and capital expenditure expectations that substantially drive valuation, diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from existing businesses, the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and potential difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving anticipated operational improvements. Acquired businesses may not achieve expected results.\n\u2022\nTredegar is subject to various environmental laws and regulations and could become exposed to material liabilities and costs associated with such laws. The Company is subject to various environmental obligations and could become subject to additional obligations in the future. Changes in environmental laws and regulations, or their application, including those relating to global climate change and plastic products, could subject Tredegar to significant additional capital expenditures and operating expenses. Moreover, future developments in federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations are difficult to predict. Environmental laws have become and are expected to continue to become increasingly strict. As a result, Tredegar expects to be subject to new environmental laws and regulations. However, any such changes are uncertain and, therefore, it is not possible for the Company to predict with certainty the amount of additional capital expenditures or operating expenses that could be necessary for compliance with respect to any such changes. See Government Regulation in \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d for a further discussion of this risk factor.\n\u2022\nMaterial disruptions at one of the Company\u2019s major manufacturing facilities could negatively impact financial results. Tredegar believes its facilities are operated in compliance with applicable local laws and regulations and that the Company has implemented measures to minimize the risks of disruption at its facilities. Such a disruption could be a result of any number of events: an equipment failure with repairs requiring long lead times, labor stoppages or shortages, cybersecurity attacks, utility disruptions, constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials, and severe weather conditions. A material disruption in one of the Company\u2019s operating locations could negatively impact production and its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nAn inability to renegotiate the Company\u2019s collective bargaining agreements could adversely impact its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Some of the Company\u2019s employees are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. Tredegar may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements when they expire, which could result in strikes or work stoppages or higher labor costs. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at the Company\u2019s facilities in the future. Any such work stoppages (or potential work stoppages) could negatively impact Tredegar\u2019s ability to manufacture its products and adversely affect its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nTredegar\u2019s valuation of its $7.5 million cost-basis investment in kal\u00e9o is volatile and uncertain. Tredegar uses the fair value method to account for its fully-diluted ownership interest of approximately 20% in kaleo, Inc. (\u201ckal\u00e9o\u201d), a privately held specialty pharmaceutical company. There is no active secondary market for buying or selling stock in kal\u00e9o. The Company\u2019s fair value estimates can fluctuate materially between reporting periods, primarily due to variances in its performance versus expectations and changes in the valuation of guideline public companies as measured by their enterprise value-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples. Additionally, the estimated fair value of the Company\u2019s investment in kal\u00e9o could decline. Kal\u00e9o\u2019s first product, an epinephrine auto-injector, was licensed to Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC (\u201cSanofi\u201d) in 2009. Sanofi commenced commercial sales in the first quarter of 2013. Kal\u00e9o subsequently developed and commenced commercial sales of its second product, a naloxone auto-injector (\u201cEvzio\u201d), in the third quarter of 2014. Public pressure to lower the price of pharmaceutical products continues to mount, which could affect the price at which kal\u00e9o sells its products. The U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation of kal\u00e9o\u2019s Evzio business in 2018, the impact of which on kal\u00e9o and on the value of the Company\u2019s interest in kal\u00e9o cannot yet be estimated with any certainty. See Note 4 to the Notes to Financial Statements (\u201cNote 4\u201d) for more information.\n\u2022\nRising trade tensions. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s business involves imports to and from the U.S. and other countries where the Company produces and sells its products. Trade tensions have been rising between the U.S. and other countries, particularly China. An increase in tariffs and other trade barriers between the U.S. and China, or between the U.S. and other countries, could cause an increase in the cost of the Company\u2019s products or otherwise negatively impact the production and sale of the Company\u2019s products in world markets.\n\u2022\nA failure in the Company\u2019s information technology systems as a result of cybersecurity attacks or other causes could negatively affect Tredegar\u2019s business. The Company depends on information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) to record and process customers' orders, manufacture and ship products in a timely manner, secure its production processes and know-how, and maintain the financial accuracy of its business records. An IT system failure due to computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, or other malicious causes could disrupt our operations and prevent us from being able to process transactions with our customers, operate our manufacturing facilities and properly report transactions in a timely manner. Increased global IT security threats and cyber-crime pose a potential risk to the security and availability of the Company\u2019s IT systems, networks, and services, including those that are managed, hosted, provided, or used by third parties, as well as to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the Company\u2019s data. To date, interruptions of the Company\u2019s IT systems have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on the Company\u2019s operations. A significant protracted failure of or security breach of the IT systems, networks, or service providers the Company relies upon, or a loss or disclosure of business or other sensitive information, as a result of a cybersecurity incident or other cause, could result in damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and legal challenges, and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.", "PERMNO": 75649, "SIC": 3081, "TIC": "TG"}
