{"cik": "1136174", "company": "CATASYS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-07", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information in this report, including the risk factors listed below. Risks and uncertainties in addition to those we describe below, that may not be presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also harm our business and operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our Company. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed, the price of our common stock could decline, and future events and circumstances could differ significantly from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks related to our business\nWe have a limited operating history, expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses and may be unable to obtain additional financing.\nWe have been unprofitable since our inception in 2003 and expect to incur substantial additional operating losses and negative cash flow from operations for at least the next twelve months. At December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents was approximately $4.8 million and accumulated deficit was approximately $293 million. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents used by operating activities was $6.9 million. Although we have taken actions to increase our revenue and we may need to additional financing, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts. We may not be successful in raising necessary funds on acceptable terms or at all, and we may not be able to offset our operating losses by sufficient reductions in expenses and increases in revenue. If this occurs, we may be unable to meet our cash obligations as they become due and we may be required to further delay or reduce operating expenses and curtail our operations, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may fail to successfully manage and grow our business, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nContinued expansion could put significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources. The need to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC will continue to place significant demands on our financial and accounting staff, financial, accounting and information systems, and our internal controls and procedures, any of which may not be adequate to support our anticipated growth. The need to comply with the state and federal healthcare, security and privacy regulation will continue to place significant demands on our staff and our policies and procedures, any of which may not be adequate to support our anticipated growth. We may not be able to effectively hire, train, retain, motivate and manage required personnel. Our failure to manage growth effectively could limit our ability to satisfy our reporting obligations, or achieve our marketing, commercialization and financial goals.\nWe may need additional funding, and we cannot guarantee that we will find adequate sources of capital in the future.\nWe have incurred negative cash flows from operations since inception and have expended, and expect to continue to expend, substantial funds to grow our business. We may require additional funds before we achieve positive cash flows and we may never become cash flow positive.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, such financing will result in further dilution to our stockholders. Any equity securities issued also may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations.\nWe do not know whether additional financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on commercially acceptable terms, we may need to continue to downsize, curtail program development efforts or halt our operations altogether.\nOur programs may not be as effective as we believe them to be, which could limit our potential revenue growth.\nOur belief in the efficacy of our OnTrak solution is based on a limited experience with a relatively small number of patients. Such results may not be statistically significant, have not been subjected to close scientific scrutiny, and may not be indicative of the long-term future performance of treatment with our programs. If the initially indicated results cannot be successfully replicated or maintained over time, utilization of our programs could decline substantially. There are no standardized methods for measuring efficacy of programs such as ours. Even if we believe our solutions are effective, our customers could determine they are not utilizing different outcomes measures. In addition, even if our customers determine our solutions are effective they may discontinue them because they determine that the aggregate cost savings are not sufficient or that our programs do not have a high enough return on investment. Our success is dependent on our ability to enroll third-party payor members in our OnTrak solutions. Large scale outreach and enrollment efforts have not been conducted and only for limited time periods and we may not be able to achieve the anticipated enrollment rates.\nOur OnTrak solution may not become widely accepted, which could limit our growth.\nOur ability to achieve further marketplace acceptance for our OnTrak solution may be dependent on our ability to contract with a sufficient number of third party payors and to demonstrate financial and clinical outcomes from those agreements. If we are unable to secure sufficient contracts to achieve recognition or acceptance of our OnTrak solution or if our program does not demonstrate the expected level of clinical improvement and cost savings, it is unlikely that we will be able to achieve widespread market acceptance.\nDisappointing results for our solutions or failure to attain our publicly disclosed milestones could adversely affect market acceptance and have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nDisappointing results, later-than-expected press release announcements or termination of evaluations, pilot programs or commercial OnTrak solutions could have a material adverse effect on the commercial acceptance of our solutions, our stock price and on our results of operations. In addition, announcements regarding results, or anticipation of results, may increase volatility in our stock price. In addition to numerous upcoming milestones, from time to time we provide financial guidance and other forecasts to the market. While we believe that the assumptions underlying projections and forecasts we make publicly available are reasonable, projections and forecasts are inherently subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Any failure to achieve milestones, or to do so in a timely manner, or to achieve publicly announced guidance and forecasts, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete successfully.\nThe healthcare business in general, and the behavioral health treatment business in particular, are highly competitive. While we believe our products and services are unique, we operate in highly competitive markets. We compete with other healthcare management service organizations, care management and disease management companies, including Managed Behavioral Healthcare Organizations (MBHOs), other specialty healthcare and managed care companies, and healthcare technology companies that are offering treatment and support of behavioral health on-line and on mobile devices. Most of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. We believe that our ability to offer customers a comprehensive and integrated behavioral health solution, including the utilization of our analytical models and innovative member engagement methodologies, will enable us to compete effectively. However, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter more effective competition in the future, that we will have financial resources to continue to improve our offerings or that we will be successful improving them, which would limit our ability to maintain or increase our business.\nOur competitors may develop and introduce new processes and products that are equal or superior to our programs in treating behavioral health conditions. Accordingly, we may be adversely affected by any new processes and products developed by our competitors.\nWe depend on key personnel, the loss of which could impact the ability to manage our business.\nWe are highly dependent on our senior management and key operating and technical personnel. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management and key operating and technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We also rely on consultants and advisors to assist us in formulating our strategy. All of our consultants and advisors are either self-employed or employed by other organizations, and they may have conflicts of interest or other commitments, such as consulting or advisory contracts with other organizations, that may affect their ability to contribute to us.\nWe will need to hire additional employees in order to achieve our objectives. There is currently intense competition for skilled executives and employees with relevant expertise, and this competition is likely to continue. The inability to attract and retain sufficient personnel could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to future litigation, which could result in substantial liabilities that may exceed our insurance coverage.\nAll significant medical treatments and procedures, including treatment utilizing our programs, involve the risk of serious injury or death. While we have not been the subject of any such claims, our business entails an inherent risk of claims for personal injuries and substantial damage awards. We cannot control whether individual physicians and therapists will apply the appropriate standard of care in determining how to treat their patients. While our agreements typically require physicians to indemnify us for their negligence, there can be no assurance they will be willing and financially able to do so if claims are made. In addition, our license agreements require us to indemnify physicians, hospitals or their affiliates for losses resulting from our negligence.\nWe currently have insurance coverage for personal injury claims, directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance coverage, and errors and omissions insurance. We may not be able to maintain adequate liability insurance at acceptable costs or on favorable terms. We expect that liability insurance will be more difficult to obtain and that premiums will increase over time and as the volume of patients treated with our programs increases. In the event of litigation, we may sustain significant damages or settlement expense (regardless of a claim's merit), litigation expense and significant harm to our reputation.\nIf third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate payment rates for our solutions, our revenue and prospects for profitability will be harmed.\nOur future revenue growth will depend in part upon our ability to contract with health plans and other insurance payors for our OnTrak solutions. To date, we have not received a significant amount of revenue from our OnTrak solutions from health plans and other insurance payors, and acceptance of our OnTrak solutions is critical to the future prospects of our business. In addition, insurance payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs, and may not cover or provide adequate payment for our programs. Adequate insurance reimbursement might not be available to enable us to realize an appropriate return on investment in research and product development, and the lack of such reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our operations and could adversely affect our revenues and earnings.\nWe may not be able to achieve promised savings for our OnTrak contracts, which could result in pricing levels insufficient to cover our costs or ensure profitability.\nWe anticipate that many of our OnTrak contracts will be based upon anticipated or guaranteed levels of savings for our customers and achieving other operational metrics resulting in incentive fees based on savings. If we are unable to meet or exceed promised savings, achieve agreed upon operational metrics, or favorably resolve contract billing and interpretation issues with our customers, we may be required to refund from the amount of fees paid to us any difference between savings that were guaranteed and the savings, if any, which were actually achieved; or we may fail to earn incentive fees based on savings. Accordingly, during or at the end of the contract terms, we may be required to refund some or all of the fees paid for our services. This exposes us to significant risk that contracts negotiated and entered into may ultimately be unprofitable. In addition, managed care operations are at risk for costs incurred to provide agreed upon services under our solution. Therefore, failure to anticipate or control costs could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) of approximately $235 million for federal income tax purposes that will begin to expire in 2025. These NOLs may be used to offset future taxable income, to the extent we generate any taxable income, and thereby reduce or eliminate our future federal income taxes otherwise payable. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes limitations on a corporation's ability to utilize NOLs if it experiences an ownership change as defined in Section 382. In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period. In the event that an ownership change has occurred, or were to occur, utilization of our NOLs would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 determined by multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years. We may be found to have experienced an ownership change under Section 382 as a result of events in the past or the issuance of shares of common stock, or a combination thereof. If so, the use of our NOLs, or a portion thereof, against our future taxable income may be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382, which may result in expiration of a portion of our NOLs before utilization.\nWe have not held regular annual meetings in the past, and if we are required by the Delaware Court of Chancery to hold an annual meeting pursuant to Section 211(c) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), it could result in the unanticipated expenditure of funds, time and other Company resources.\nSection 2.1 of the Company\u2019s By-Laws provides that an annual meeting shall be held each year on a date and at a time designated by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and Section 211(b) of the DGCL provides for an annual meeting of stockholders to be held for the election of directors. Section 211(c) of the DGCL provides that if there is a failure to hold the annual meeting for a period of 13 months after the latest to occur of the organization of the corporation, its last annual meeting or last action by written consent to elect directors in lieu of an annual meeting, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order a meeting to be held upon the application of any stockholder or director. Section 211(c) also provides that the failure to hold an annual meeting shall not affect otherwise valid corporate acts or result in a forfeiture or dissolution of the corporation.\nWe have not held regular annual meetings in the past because a substantial majority of our stock is owned by a small number of stockholders, making it easy to obtain written consent in lieu of a meeting when necessary. In light of our historical liquidity constraints, handling matters by written consent has allowed the Company to save on the financial and administrative resources required to prepare for and hold such annual meetings. Additionally, we listed our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market in April 2017. Pursuant to NASDAQ\u2019s corporate governance requirements, the Company will be obligated to hold regular annual meetings in the future, and it is currently contemplated that we will hold such meetings beginning in 2018.\nTo our knowledge, no stockholder or director has requested the Company\u2019s management to hold such an annual meeting and no stockholder or director has applied to the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking an order directing the Company to hold a meeting. However, if one or more stockholders or directors were to apply to the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking such an order, and if the Delaware Court of Chancery were to order an annual meeting before the Company was prepared to hold one, the preparation for the annual meeting and the meeting itself could result in the unanticipated expenditure of funds, time, and other Company resources.\nRisks related to our intellectual property\nConfidentiality agreements with employees, treating physicians and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nIn order to protect our proprietary technology and processes, we rely in part on confidentiality provisions in our agreements with employees, treating physicians, and others. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nWe may be subject to claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, and unfavorable outcomes could harm our business.\nOur future operations may be subject to claims, and potential litigation, arising from our alleged infringement of patents, trade secrets, trademarks or copyrights owned by other third parties. Within the healthcare, drug and bio-technology industry, many companies actively pursue infringement claims and litigation, which makes the entry of competitive products more difficult. We may experience claims or litigation initiated by existing, better-funded competitors and by other third parties. Court-ordered injunctions may prevent us from continuing to market existing products or from bringing new products to market and the outcome of litigation and any resulting loss of revenues and expenses of litigation may substantially affect our ability to meet our expenses and continue operations.\nRisks related to our industry\nRecent changes in insurance and health care laws have created uncertainty in the health care industry.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2010, generally known as the Health Care Reform Law, significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans and changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers. The 2016 federal elections, which resulted in the election of the Republican presidential nominee and Republican majorities in both houses of Congress, is likely to prompt renewed legislative efforts to significantly modify or repeal the Health Care Reform Law, is likely to impact how the executive branch implements the law, and may impact how the federal government responds to lawsuits challenging the Health Care Reform Law. We cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on our business. There may also be other risks and uncertainties associated with the Health Care Reform Law. If we fail to comply or are unable to effectively manage such risks and uncertainties, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur policies and procedures may not fully comply with complex and increasing regulation by state and federal authorities, which could negatively impact our business operations.\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated and continues to undergo significant changes as third-party payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, traditional indemnity insurers, managed care organizations and other private payors, increase efforts to control cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services. Healthcare companies are subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local laws, regulations and judicial decisions. Our failure or the failure of our treating physicians, to comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may result in the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions that we cannot afford, or require redesign or withdrawal of our programs from the market.\nWe or our healthcare professionals may be subject to regulatory, enforcement and investigative proceedings, which could adversely affect our financial condition or operations.\nWe or one or more of our healthcare professionals could become the subject of regulatory, enforcement, or other investigations or proceedings, and our relationships, business structure, and interpretations of applicable laws and regulations may be challenged. The defense of any such challenge could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention. In addition, any such challenge could require significant changes to how we conduct our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, regardless of whether the challenge ultimately is successful. If determination is made that we or one or more of our healthcare professionals has failed to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business practices may be found to constitute illegal fee-splitting or corporate practice of medicine, which may lead to penalties and adversely affect our business.\nMany states, including California where our principal executive offices are located, have laws that prohibit business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine, exercising control over medical judgments or decisions of physicians or other health care professionals (such as nurses or nurse practitioners), or engaging in certain business arrangements with physicians or other health care professionals, such as employment of physicians and other health care professionals or fee-splitting. The state laws and regulations and administrative and judicial decisions that enumerate the specific corporate practice and fee-splitting rules vary considerably from state to state and are enforced by both the courts and government agencies, each with broad discretion. Courts, government agencies or other parties, including physicians, may assert that we are engaged in the unlawful corporate practice of medicine, fee-splitting, or payment for referrals by providing administrative and other services in connection with our treatment programs. As a result of such allegations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, our contracts could be found invalid and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or we could be required to restructure our contractual arrangements. If so, we may be unable to restructure our contractual arrangements on favorable terms, which would adversely affect our business and operations.\nOur business practices may be found to violate anti-kickback, physician self-referral or false claims laws, which may lead to penalties and adversely affect our business.\nThe healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation with respect to kickbacks, physician self-referral arrangements, false claims and other fraud and abuse issues.\nThe federal anti-kickback law (the \u201cAnti-Kickback Law\u201d) prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program. \u201cRemuneration\u201d is broadly defined to include anything of value, such as, for example, cash payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, or the furnishing of services, supplies, or equipment. The Anti-Kickback Law is broad, and it prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry.\nRecognizing the breadth of the Anti-Kickback Law and the fact that it may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the health care industry, the Office of Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) has issued a series of regulations, known as the \u201csafe harbors.\u201d Compliance with all requirements of a safe harbor immunizes the parties to the business arrangement from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Law. The failure of a business arrangement to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the arrangement is illegal or that the OIG will pursue prosecution. Still, in the absence of an applicable safe harbor, a violation of the Anti-Kickback Law may occur even if only one purpose of an arrangement is to induce referrals. The penalties for violating the Anti-Kickback Law can be severe. These sanctions include criminal and civil penalties, imprisonment, and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Law, and some apply to items and services reimbursable by any payor, including private insurers.\nIn addition, the federal ban on physician self-referrals, commonly known as the Stark Law, prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare patients to an entity providing certain \u201cdesignated health services\u201d if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has any financial relationship with the entity. A \u201cfinancial relationship\u201d is created by an investment interest or a compensation arrangement. Penalties for violating the Stark Law include the return of funds received for all prohibited referrals, fines, civil monetary penalties, and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. In addition to the Stark Law, many states have their own self-referral bans, which may extend to all self-referrals, regardless of the payor.\nThe federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government. Under the False Claims Act, a person acts knowingly if he has actual knowledge of the information or acts in deliberate ignorance or in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information. Specific intent to defraud is not required. Violations of other laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Law or the FDA prohibitions against promotion of off-label uses of drugs, can lead to liability under the federal False Claims Act. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the federal government and to share in any amounts paid by the defendant to the government in connection with the action. The number of filings of qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each false claim. Conduct that violates the False Claims Act may also lead to exclusion from the federal health care programs. Given the number of claims likely to be at issue, potential damages under the False Claims Act for even a single inappropriate billing arrangement could be significant. In addition, various states have enacted similar laws modeled after the False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state health care programs, and, in several states, such laws apply to claims submitted to all payors.\nOn May 20, 2009, the Federal Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, or FERA, became law, and it significantly amended the federal False Claims Act. Among other things, FERA eliminated the requirement that a claim must be presented to the federal government. As a result, False Claims Act liability extends to any false or fraudulent claim for government money, regardless of whether the claim is submitted to the government directly, or whether the government has physical custody of the money. FERA also specifically imposed False Claims Act liability if an entity \u201cknowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the Government.\u201d As a result, the knowing and improper failure to return an overpayment can serve as the basis for a False Claims Act action. In March 2010, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the ACA, which also made sweeping changes to the federal False Claims Act. The ACA also established that Medicare and Medicaid overpayments must be reported and returned within 60 days of identification or when any corresponding cost report is due.\nFinally, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations created the crimes of health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including a private insurer. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, or exclusion from the federal health care programs.\nFederal or state authorities may claim that our fee arrangements, our agreements and relationships with contractors, hospitals and physicians, or other activities violate fraud and abuse laws and regulations. If our business practices are found to violate any of these laws or regulations, we may be unable to continue with our relationships or implement our business plans, which would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, defending our business practices could be time consuming and expensive, and an adverse finding could result in substantial penalties or require us to restructure our operations, which we may not be able to do successfully.\nOur business practices may be subject to state regulatory and licensure requirements.\nOur business practices may be regulated by state regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. These regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically. Some of our business and related activities may be subject to state health care-related regulations and requirements, including managed health care, utilization review (UR) or third-party administrator-related regulations and licensure requirements. These regulations differ from state to state, and may contain network, contracting, and financial and reporting requirements, as well as specific standards for delivery of services, payment of claims, and adequacy of health care professional networks. If a determination is made that we have failed to comply with any applicable state laws or regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to healthcare anti-fraud initiatives, which may lead to penalties and adversely affect our business.\nState and federal government agencies are devoting increased attention and resources to anti-fraud initiatives against healthcare providers and the entities and individuals with whom they do business, and such agencies may define fraud expansively to include our business practices, including the receipt of fees in connection with a healthcare business that is found to violate any of the complex regulations described above. While to our knowledge we have not been the subject of any anti-fraud investigations, if such a claim were made, defending our business practices could be time consuming and expensive and an adverse finding could result in substantial penalties or require us to restructure our operations, which we may not be able to do successfully.\nOur use and disclosure of patient information is subject to privacy and security regulations, which may result in increased costs.\nIn providing administrative services to healthcare providers and operating our treatment programs, we may collect, use, disclose, maintain and transmit patient information in ways that will be subject to many of the numerous state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, storage, privacy and security of patient-identifiable health information, including the administrative simplification requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH). The HIPAA Privacy Rule restricts the use and disclosure of patient information (\u201cProtected Health Information\u201d or \u201cPHI\u201d), and requires safeguarding that information. The HIPAA Security Rule and HITECH establish elaborate requirements for safeguarding PHI transmitted or stored electronically. HIPAA applies to covered entities, which may include healthcare facilities and also includes health plans that will contract for the use of our programs and our services. HIPAA and HITECH require covered entities to bind contractors that use or disclose protected health information (or \u201cBusiness Associates\u201d) to compliance with certain aspects of the HIPAA Privacy Rule and all of the HIPAA Security Rule. In addition to contractual liability, Business Associates are also directly subject to regulation by the federal government. Direct liability means that we are subject to audit, investigation and enforcement by federal authorities. HITECH imposes new breach notification obligations requiring us to report breaches of \u201cUnsecured Protected Health Information\u201d or PHI that has not been encrypted or destroyed in accordance with federal standards. Business Associates must report such breaches so that their covered entity customers may in turn notify all affected patients, the federal government, and in some cases, local or national media outlets. We may be required to indemnify our covered entity customers for costs associated with breach notification and the mitigation of harm resulting from breaches that we cause. If we are providing management services that include electronic billing on behalf of a physician practice or facility that is a covered entity, we may be required to conduct those electronic transactions in accordance with the HIPAA regulations governing the form and format of those transactions. Services provided under our OnTrak solution not only require us to comply with HIPAA and HITECH but also Title 42 Part 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations (\u201cPart 2\u201d). Part 2 is a federal, criminal law that severely restricts our ability to use and disclose drug and alcohol treatment information obtained from federally-supported treatment facilities. Our operations must be carefully structured to avoid liability under this law. Our OnTrak solution qualifies as a federally funded treatment facility which requires us to disclose information on members only in compliance with Title 42. In addition to the federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing the privacy and security of health and personal information. The penalties for violation of these laws vary widely and the area is rapidly evolving. We believe that we have taken the steps required of us to comply with health information privacy and security laws and regulations in all jurisdictions, both state and federal. However, we may not be able to maintain compliance in all jurisdictions where we do business. Failure to maintain compliance, or changes in state or federal privacy and security laws could result in civil and/or criminal penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business, including significant reputational damage associated with a breach. If regulations change or it is determined that we are not in compliance with privacy regulations we may be required to modify aspects of our program which may adversely affect program results and our business or profitability. Under HITECH, we are subject to prosecution or administrative enforcement and increased civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance, including a new, four-tiered system of monetary penalties. We are also subject to enforcement by state attorneys general who were given authority to enforce HIPAA under HITECH.\nCertain of our professional healthcare employees, such as nurses, must comply with individual licensing requirements.\nAll of our healthcare professionals who are subject to licensing requirements, such as our care coaches, are licensed in the state in which they provide professional services in person. While we believe our nurses provide coaching and not professional services, one or more states may require our healthcare professionals to obtain licensure if providing services telephonically across state lines to the state\u2019s residents. Healthcare professionals who fail to comply with these licensure requirements could face fines or other penalties for practicing without a license, and we could be required to pay those fines on behalf of our healthcare professionals. If we are required to obtain licenses for our nurses in states where they provide telephonic coaching, it would significantly increase the cost of providing our product. In addition, new and evolving agency interpretations, federal or state legislation or regulations, or judicial decisions could lead to the implementation of out-of-state licensure requirements in additional states, and such changes would increase the cost of services and could have a material effect on our business.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business, prevent us from accessing critical information or expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected patient health information, personally identifiable information about our employees, intellectual property, and proprietary business information. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing an off-site co-location facility. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business critical information including research and development information, commercial information and business and financial information.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, viruses, breaches or interruptions due to employee error or malfeasance, terrorist attacks, earthquakes, fire, flood, other natural disasters, power loss, computer systems failure, data network failure, Internet failure or lapses in compliance with privacy and security mandates. Any such virus, breach or interruption could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. We have measures in place that are designed to detect and respond to such security incidents and breaches of privacy and security mandates. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as HIPAA, government enforcement actions and regulatory penalties. We may also be required to indemnify our customers for costs associated with having their data on our system breached. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also interrupt our operations, including our ability to bill our customers, provide customer support services, conduct research and development activities, process and prepare company financial information, manage various general and administrative aspects of our business and damage our reputation, or we may lose one or more of our customers, especially if they felt their data may be breached, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nRisks related to our common stock\nOur common stock has limited trading volume, and it is therefore susceptible to high price volatility.\nOur common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \u201cCATS\u201d and has limited trading volume. As such, our common stock is more susceptible to significant and sudden price changes than stocks that are widely followed by the investment community and actively traded on an exchange. The liquidity of our common stock depends upon the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers. We cannot assure you that you will be able to find a buyer for your shares. In the future, if we successfully list the common stock on a securities exchange or obtain trading authorization, we will not be able to assure you that an organized public market for our securities will develop or that there will be any private demand for the common stock. We could also subsequently fail to satisfy the standards for continued national securities exchange trading, such as standards having to do with a minimum share price, the minimum number of public shareholders or the aggregate market value of publicly held shares. Any holder of our securities should regard them as a long-term investment and should be prepared to bear the economic risk of an investment in our securities for an indefinite period.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our operating results and the market for our common stock.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we maintain internal control over financial reporting that meets applicable standards. As with many smaller companies with small staff, material weaknesses in our financial controls and procedures may be discovered. If we are unable, or are perceived as unable, to produce reliable financial reports due to internal control deficiencies, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and operating results, which could result in a negative market reaction and adversely affect our ability to raise capital.\nApproximately 61% of our outstanding common stock is beneficially owned by our chairman and chief executive officer, who has the ability to substantially influence the election of directors and other matters submitted to stockholders.\n10,467,605 shares are beneficially held of record by Acuitas Group Holdings, LLC (\u201cAcuitas\u201d), whose sole managing member is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, which represents beneficial ownership of approximately 61% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, he has and is expected to continue to have the ability to significantly influence the election of our Board of Directors and the outcome of all other matters submitted to our stockholders. His interest may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders, and he may act in a manner that advances his best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders. One consequence to this substantial influence or control is that it may be difficult for investors to remove management of our Company. It could also deter unsolicited takeovers, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices.\nOur stock price may be subject to substantial volatility, and the value of our stockholders' investment may decline.\nThe price at which our common stock will trade may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the number of shares available for sale in the market, quarterly variations in our operating results and actual or anticipated announcements of our OnTrak solution, announcements regarding new or discontinued OnTrak solution contracts, new products or services by us or competitors, regulatory investigations or determinations, acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors, recruitment or departures of key personnel, the gain or loss of significant customers, changes in the estimates of our operating performance, actual or threatened litigation, market conditions in our industry and the economy as a whole.\nNumerous factors, including many over which we have no control, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock, including:\n\u25cf\nannouncements of new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\ncurrent events affecting the political, economic and social situation in the United States;\n\u25cf\ntrends in our industry and the markets in which we operate;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf\nacquisitions and financings by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe gain or loss of a significant customer;\n\u25cf\nquarterly variations in operating results;\n\u25cf\nthe operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may consider to be comparable;\n\u25cf\npurchases or sales of blocks of our securities; and\n\u25cf\nissuances of stock.\nFurthermore, stockholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our stock drops significantly, which may cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management.\nFuture sales of common stock by existing stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur, could depress our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by, or the perceived possibility of sales by, our existing stockholders. We have completed a number of private placements of our common stock and other securities over the last several years, and we have effective resale registration statements pursuant to which the purchasers can freely resell their shares into the market. In addition, most of our outstanding shares are eligible for public resale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As of March 2, 2018, approximately 4.7 million shares of our common stock are held by our affiliates and may be sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or in accordance with the volume and other limitations of Rule 144 or pursuant to other exempt transactions. Future sales of common stock by significant stockholders, including those who acquired their shares in private placements or who are affiliates, or the perception that such sales may occur, could depress the price of our common stock.\nFuture issuances of common stock and hedging activities may depress the trading price of our common stock.\nAny future issuance of equity securities, including the issuance of shares upon direct registration, upon satisfaction of our obligations, compensation of vendors, exercise of outstanding warrants, or effectuation of a reverse stock split, could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders, and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock. As of March 2, 2018, we have outstanding options to purchase approximately 1,885,052 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase approximately 2,035,528 shares of our common stock at prices ranging from $1.80 to $6,312.00 per share. We may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy, in connection with acquisitions, to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options or for other reasons.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing, which might include sales of equity securities. The issuance of any additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into, exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive common stock or the exercise of such securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of shares of our common stock. Holders of shares of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock made after this offering or the perception that such sales could occur. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their interests in our Company.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law could discourage a change in control, or an acquisition of us by a third party, even if the acquisition would be favorable to you.\nOur certificate of incorporation and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of our Company, even when these attempts may be in the best interests of stockholders. For example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to issue one or more series of preferred stock, which could have voting and conversion rights that adversely affect or dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock. Delaware law also imposes conditions on certain business combination transactions with \u201cinterested stockholders.\u201d These provisions and others that could be adopted in the future could deter unsolicited takeovers or delay or prevent changes in our control or management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. These provisions may also limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have paid no cash dividends on our common stock to date, and we intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the continued development and growth of our business. As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Further, any payment of cash dividends will also depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors, including contractual restrictions to which we may be subject, and will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors.\nA few of our outstanding warrants contain anti-dilution provisions that, if triggered, could cause substantial dilution to our then-existing stockholders and adversely affect our stock price.\nA few of our outstanding warrants contain anti-dilution provisions. As a result, if we, in the future, issue or grant any rights to purchase any of our common stock or other securities convertible into our common stock for a per share price less than the exercise price of our warrants, the exercise price, or in the case of some of our warrants the exercise price and number of shares of common stock, will be reduced. If our available funds and cash generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements in the future, then we may need to raise substantial additional funds in the future to support our working capital requirements and for other purposes. If shares of our common stock or securities exercisable for our common stock are issued in consideration of such funds at an effective per share price lower than our existing warrants, then the anti-dilution provisions would be triggered, thus possibly causing substantial dilution to our then-existing shareholders if such warrants are exercised. Such anti-dilution provisions may also make it more difficult for us to obtain financing.\nThe exercise of our outstanding warrants may result in a dilution of our current stockholders' voting power and an increase in the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market, which may negatively impact the market price of our stock.\nThe exercise of some or all of our outstanding warrants could significantly dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. As of March 2, 2018, we had outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,035,528 shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from $1.80 to $18.00 per share. To the extent warrants are exercised, additional shares of common stock will be issued, and such issuance may dilute existing stockholders and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market.\nIn addition to the dilutive effects described above, the exercise of those warrants would lead to a potential increase in the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our shares.", "PERMNO": 89956, "SIC": 8060, "TIC": "OTRK"}
