The following risk factors and other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed with the SEC should be considered for a better understanding of our Company. These important factors and other matters discussed herein could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ materially.\nOPERATING RISKS\nOur current or future development, expansion and acquisition activities may not be successful, which could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy.\nExecution of our future growth plan is dependent on successful ongoing and future development, expansion and acquisition activities. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to complete development projects or acquisitions we undertake or continue to develop attractive opportunities for growth. Factors that could cause our development, expansion and acquisition activities to be unsuccessful include:\n\u2022\nOur inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals or the imposition of adverse conditions upon the approval of any acquisition;\n\u2022\nOur inability to secure adequate utility rates through regulatory proceedings;\n\u2022\nOur inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nThe possibility that one or more credit rating agencies would downgrade our issuer credit rating to below investment grade, thus increasing our cost of doing business;\n\u2022\nOur inability to successfully integrate any businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\nOur inability to attract and retain management or other key personnel;\n\u2022\nOur inability to negotiate acceptable acquisition, construction, fuel supply, power sales or other material agreements;\n\u2022\nThe trend of utilities building their own generation or looking for developers to develop and build projects for sale to utilities under turnkey arrangements;\n\u2022\nReduced growth in the demand for utility services in the markets we serve;\n\u2022\nChanges in federal, state, local or tribal laws and regulations, particularly those which would make it more difficult or costly to fully develop our coal reserves, our oil and gas reserves and our generation capacity;\n\u2022\nFuel prices or fuel supply constraints;\n\u2022\nPipeline capacity and transmission constraints;\n\u2022\nCompetition within our industry and with producers of competing energy sources; and\n\u2022\nChanges in tax rates and policies.\nOur financial performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. If the risks involved in our operations are not appropriately managed or mitigated, our operations may not be successful and this could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOperating electric generating facilities, oil and gas properties, the coal mine and electric and natural gas distribution systems involves risks, including:\n\u2022\nOperational limitations imposed by environmental and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nInterruptions to supply of fuel and other commodities used in generation and distribution. The Utilities Group purchases fuel from a number of suppliers. Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the delivery of fuel due to various factors, including but not limited to, transportation delays, labor relations, weather and environmental regulations, which could limit the Utilities Group\u2019s ability to operate their facilities;\n\u2022\nBreakdown or failure of equipment or processes, including those operated by PacifiCorp at the Wyodak plant;\n\u2022\nInability to recruit and retain skilled technical labor;\n\u2022\nDisrupted transmission and distribution. We depend on transmission and distribution facilities, including those operated by unaffiliated parties, to deliver the electricity and gas that we sell to our retail and wholesale customers. If transmission is interrupted, our ability to sell or deliver product and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered;\n\u2022\nOperating hazards such as leaks, mechanical problems and accidents, including explosions, affecting our natural gas distribution system which could impact public safety, reliability and customer confidence;\n\u2022\nElectricity is dangerous for employees and the general public should they come in contact with power lines or electrical equipment. Natural conditions and other disasters such as wind, lightning and winter storms can cause wildfires, pole failures and associated property damage and outages. For example, as described in more detail under \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d a fire investigator concluded that a forest and grassland fire in the western Black Hills of Wyoming and South Dakota in 2012 was caused by the failure of a transmission structure owned, operated and maintained by Black Hills Power, and claims have been made against us related to the fire;\n\u2022\nDisruption in the functioning of our information technology and network infrastructure which are vulnerable to disability, failures and unauthorized access. If our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions; and\n\u2022\nLabor relations. Approximately 30% of our employees are represented by a total of six collective bargaining agreements.\nConstruction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve significant risks which could reduce profitability.\nThe construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve many risks, including:\n\u2022\nThe inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals along with the cost of complying with or satisfying conditions imposed upon such approvals;\n\u2022\nContractual restrictions upon the timing of scheduled outages;\n\u2022\nThe cost of supplying or securing replacement power during scheduled and unscheduled outages;\n\u2022\nThe unavailability or increased cost of equipment;\n\u2022\nThe cost of recruiting and retaining or the unavailability of skilled labor;\n\u2022\nSupply interruptions, work stoppages and labor disputes;\n\u2022\nIncreased capital and operating costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nOpposition by members of public or special-interest groups;\n\u2022\nWeather interferences;\n\u2022\nAvailability and cost of fuel supplies;\n\u2022\nUnexpected engineering, environmental and geological problems; and\n\u2022\nUnanticipated cost overruns.\nThe ongoing operation of our facilities involves many of the risks described above, in addition to risks relating to the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. New plants may employ recently developed and technologically complex equipment, including newer environmental emission control technology. Any of these risks could cause us to operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues, increase expenses or cause us to incur higher operating and maintenance costs and penalties. While we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance and our rights under warranties or performance guarantees may not be timely or adequate to cover lost revenues, increased expenses, liability or liquidated damage payments.\nOperating results can be adversely affected by variations from normal weather conditions.\nOur utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance. Demand for electricity is typically greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating. Because natural gas is primarily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand for this product depends heavily upon winter weather patterns throughout our service territory and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating seasons. Accordingly, our utility operations have historically generated lower revenues and income when weather conditions are cooler than normal in the summer and warmer than normal in the winter. Unusually mild summers and winters therefore could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur businesses are located in areas that could be subject to seasonal natural disasters such as severe snow and ice storms, flooding and wildfires. These factors could result in interruption of our business, damage to our property such as power lines and substations and repair and clean-up costs associated with these storms. We may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring transmission and distribution property following these natural disasters through a change in our regulated rates thereby resulting in a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur coal mining operations are subject to operating risks that are beyond our control which could affect our profitability and production levels. Our surface mining operations could be disrupted or materially affected due to adverse weather or natural disasters such as heavy snow, strong winds, rain or flooding. Additionally, weather patterns can also affect electricity demand. Extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, cause increased power usage, and therefore, increased generating requirements and the use of coal. Conversely, mild temperatures could result in lower electrical demand.\nWeather conditions can also limit or temporarily halt our drilling, completion and producing activities and other crude oil and natural gas operations. Primarily in the winter and spring, our operations can be curtailed because of cold, snow and wet conditions. Severe weather could further curtail these operations, including drilling, and completion of new wells or production from existing wells. In addition, weather conditions and other events could temporarily impair our ability to transport our crude oil and natural gas production.\nPrices for some of our products and services as well as a portion of our operating costs are volatile and may cause our revenues and expenses to fluctuate significantly.\nA portion of our net income is attributable to sales of contract and off-system wholesale electricity and natural gas. Energy prices are influenced by many factors outside our control, including, among other things, fuel prices, transmission constraints, supply and demand, weather, general economic conditions, and the rules, regulations and actions of system operators in those markets. Moreover, unlike most other commodities, electricity cannot be stored and therefore must be produced concurrently with its use. As a result, wholesale power markets may be subject to significant, unpredictable price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time.\nThe success of our crude oil and natural gas operations is affected by the prevailing market prices of crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices and markets historically have been, and are likely to continue to be, unpredictable. A decrease in crude oil or natural gas prices would not only reduce revenues and profits, but would also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable and may result in charges to earnings for impairment of the net capitalized cost of these assets. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for crude oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control.\nThe proliferation of domestic crude oil and natural gas shale plays in recent years has provided the market with an abundant new supply of crude oil and natural gas. The increase in domestic natural gas supply has driven prices down in recent years. The ratio of crude oil to natural gas prices remains at high levels, far in excess of the six to one heating value equivalent ratio. There is also risk that the increased domestic crude oil resources could drive crude oil prices lower.\nOur mining operation requires reliable supplies of replacement parts, explosives, fuel, tires and steel-related products. If the cost of these increase significantly, or if sources of supplies and mining equipment become unavailable to meet our replacement demands, our productivity and profitability could be lower than our current expectations. In recent years, industry-wide demand growth exceeded supply growth for certain surface mining equipment and off-the-road tires. As a result, lead times for procuring some items generally increased to several months and prices for these items increased significantly.\nOur operations rely on storage and transportation assets owned by third parties to satisfy our obligations. If storage capacity is inadequate or transportation is disrupted, our ability to satisfy our obligations may be hindered.\nOur Utilities Group and Power Generation segment rely on pipeline companies and other owners of gas storage facilities to deliver natural gas to ratepayers, to supply our natural gas-fired power plants and to hedge commodity costs. If storage capacity is inadequate or transportation is disrupted, our ability to satisfy our obligations may be hindered. As a result, we may be responsible for damages incurred by our counterparties, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current market rates, or for penalties imposed by state regulatory authorities.\nThreats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt our businesses, or the businesses of third parties, may impact our operations in unpredictable ways and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nWe are subject to the potentially adverse operating and financial effects of terrorist acts and threats and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups. Our generation, transmission and distribution facilities, fuel storage facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets, could be direct targets of, or indirectly affected by, such activities. Terrorist acts or other similar events could harm our businesses by limiting their ability to generate, purchase or transmit power and by delaying their development and construction of new generating facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities. These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure our assets and could adversely affect our operations by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels. They could also impair our ability to raise capital by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity.\nThe implementation of security guidelines and measures and maintenance of insurance, to the extent available, addressing such activities could increase costs. These types of events could materially adversely affect our financial results. In addition, these types of events could require significant management attention and resources and could adversely affect our reputation among customers and the public.\nA disruption of the regional electric transmission grid, natural gas pipeline infrastructure or other fuel sources, could negatively impact our business. Because generation, transmission systems and natural gas pipelines are part of an interconnected system, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption caused by the impact of an event on the interconnected system (such as severe weather or a generator or transmission facility outage, pipeline rupture, or a sudden significant increase or decrease in wind generation) within our system or within a neighboring system. Any such disruption could have a material impact on our financial results.\nA cyber attack may disrupt our operations, or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information and create a potential liability.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continuous use and operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information including personal information about our customers and employees. Cyber attacks targeting our electronic control systems used at our generating facilities and for electric and gas distribution systems, could result in a full or partial disruption of our electric and/or gas operations. Cyber attacks targeting other key information technology systems could further add to a full or partial disruption to our operations. Any disruption of these operations could result in a loss of service to customers and a significant decrease in revenues, as well as significant expense to repair system damage and remedy security breaches. Any theft, loss and/or fraudulent use of customer, shareowner, employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack could subject us to significant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others.\nWe have instituted security measures and safeguards to protect our operational systems and information technology assets. FERC, through the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, requires certain safeguards be implemented to deter cyber attacks. The security measures and safeguards we have implemented may not always be effective due to the evolving nature and sophistication of cyber attacks. Despite our implementation of security measures and safeguards, all of our information technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access, including cyber attacks. If our information technology systems were to fail or be breached by a cyber attack or a computer virus and be unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised which could have a material adverse effect not only on our financial results, but on our public reputation as well.\nIncreased risks of regulatory penalties could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nBusiness activities in the energy sector are heavily regulated, primarily by agencies of the federal government. Agencies that historically sought voluntary compliance, or issued non-monetary sanctions, now employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations. The FERC, CFTC, EPA, OSHA, SEC and MSHA may impose significant civil and criminal penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to our business. In addition, FERC delegated certain aspects of authority for enforcement of electric system reliability standards to the NERC, with similar penalty authority for violations. If a serious regulatory violation occurred and penalties were imposed by FERC or another federal agency, this action could have a material adverse effect on our operations and/or our financial results.\nCertain Federal laws, including the Migratory Bird Act and the Endangered Species Act, provide special protection to certain designated species. These laws and any state equivalents provide for significant civil and criminal penalties for non-permitted activities that result in harm to or harassment of certain protected animals, including damage to their habitats. If such species are located in an area in which we conduct operations, or if additional species in those areas become subject to protection, our operations and development projects, particularly transmission, generation, wind, pipeline or drilling projects, could be restricted or delayed, or we could be required to implement expensive mitigation measures.\nOur energy production, transmission and distribution activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other catastrophic events. These events could disrupt or impair our operations, create additional costs and cause substantial loss to us.\nInherent in our natural gas and electricity transmission and distribution activities, as well as our production, transportation and storage of crude oil and natural gas and our coal mining operations, are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, blow-outs, fires, releases of hazardous materials, explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial adverse financial impacts. These events could result in injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property or natural resources (including public parks), environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Particularly for our transmission and distribution lines located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the damages resulting from any such events could be significant.\nUtilities\nRegulatory commissions may refuse to approve some or all of the utility rate increases we have requested or may request in the future, or may determine that amounts passed through to customers were not prudently incurred and therefore are not recoverable, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nOur regulated electric and gas utility operations are subject to cost-of-service regulation and earnings oversight from federal and state utility commissions. This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of desired earnings levels. Our retail electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. The rates that we are allowed to charge may or may not match our related costs and allowed return on invested capital at any given time. While rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will judge all of our costs, including our direct and allocated borrowing and debt service costs, to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that produce a full recovery of our costs and the return on invested capital allowed by the applicable state public utility commission.\nTo some degree, each of our gas and electric utilities are permitted to recover certain costs (such as increased fuel and purchased power costs) without having to file a rate case. To the extent we are able to pass through such costs to our customers and a state public utility commission subsequently determines that such costs should not have been paid by the customers; we may be required to refund such costs. Any such costs not recovered through rates, or any such refund, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flow.\nIf regulatory commissions refuse to approve the implementation of a cost of service gas program to serve our natural gas utilities and the fuel needs of our electric utilities, it could adversely affect future operations or require us to make changes to our business strategy.\nWe are evaluating the implementation of a program supporting our natural gas and electric utilities that can provide longer-term price stability for our regulated customers by enhancing our current utility gas supply portfolio, through the addition of utility or affiliate owned natural gas production and reserves. In addition to providing our customers the benefits associated with more predictable long-term commodity prices, it also provides additional opportunities for increased earnings. We will require regulatory approval from our state commissions to implement this program. If regulatory commissions refuse to approve the program, we may have to reconsider our long-term strategy, including the potential for vertical integration of our oil and gas operations in support of this program.\nIf market or other conditions adversely affect operations or require us to make changes to our business strategy in any of our utility businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash goodwill impairment charge. Any significant impairment of our goodwill related to these utilities would cause a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net income and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nWe had approximately $353 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2014. A substantial portion of the goodwill is related to the Aquila Transaction. If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect operations in any of our businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash impairment charge, which would reduce our reported assets, net income and shareholders\u2019 equity. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made. The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including: future business operating performance, changes in economic conditions and interest rates, regulatory, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in technologies. Any changes in key assumptions, or actual performance compared with key assumptions, about our business and its future prospects could affect the fair value of one or more business segments, which may result in an impairment charge.\nMunicipal governments may seek to limit or deny franchise privileges which could inhibit our ability to secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation.\nMunicipal governments within our utility service territories possess the power of condemnation and could establish a municipal utility within a portion of our current service territories by limiting or denying franchise privileges for our operations and exercising powers of condemnation over all or part of our utility assets within municipal boundaries. Although condemnation is a process that is subject to constitutional protections requiring just and fair compensation, as with any judicial procedure, the outcome is uncertain. If a municipality sought to pursue this course of action, we cannot assure that we would secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation.\nPower Generation\nOur ability to execute the purchase option for the sale of Wygen I to Cheyenne Light Fuel & Power could adversely affect our Power Generation segment.\nBlack Hills Wyoming has a power sales agreement with Cheyenne Light which expires in December 2022. This power sales agreement includes an option for Cheyenne Light to purchase Black Hills Wyoming\u2019s ownership interest in the Wygen I facility until 2019. This purchase by Cheyenne Light, estimated to be approximately $154 million at December 31, 2014, would be subject to WPSC approval in order to obtain regulatory treatment. The inability to obtain power sales contracts at reasonable rates to fully utilize these assets subsequent to the expiration of long-term contracts could affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nCoal Mining\nIf the assumptions underlying our reclamation and mine closure obligations are materially inaccurate, our costs could be significantly greater than anticipated or be incurred sooner than anticipated.\nOur mining consists of surface mining operations. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and similar state laws and regulation establish operations, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining. We estimate our total reclamation liabilities based on permit requirements, engineering studies and our engineering expertise related to these requirements. The estimate of ultimate reclamation liability is reviewed periodically by our management and engineers and by government regulators. The estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from our original assumptions or if government regulations change significantly. GAAP requires that asset retirement obligations be recorded as a liability based on fair value, which reflects the present value of the estimated future cash flows. In estimating future cash flows, we consider the estimated current cost of reclamation and apply inflation rates. The resulting estimated reclamation obligations could change significantly if actual amounts or the timing of these expenses change significantly from our assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nEstimates of the quality and quantity of our coal reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in three dimensional structural modeling. Significant inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the estimated quantity and quality of our reserve which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThere are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of coal reserves. The process of coal volume estimation requires interpretations of drill hole log data and subsequent computer modeling of the intersected deposit. Significant inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the quantity and quality of our reserve estimates. The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of engineering and geological interpretation, conditions encountered during actual reserve recovery and undetected deposit anomalies. Variance from the assumptions used and drill hole modeling density could result in additions or deletions from our volume estimates. In addition, future environmental, economic or geologic changes may occur or become known that require reserve revisions either upward or downward from prior reserve estimates.\nOil and Gas\nEstimates of the quantity and value of our proved oil and gas reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves. Significant inaccuracies in interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThere are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and their associated value. The process of estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves requires interpretation of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Significant inaccuracies in interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretations and judgment and the assumptions used regarding quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves, future capital expenditures and prices for crude oil and natural gas. Actual prices, production, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves may vary from those assumed in our estimates. These variances may be significant. Any significant variance from the assumptions used could cause the actual quantity of our reserves and future net cash flow to be materially different from our estimates. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production, changes in future capital expenditures and fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices after the date of the estimate may result in substantial upward or downward revisions.\nThe potential adoption of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in restrictions which could increase costs and cause delays to the completion of certain oil and gas wells and potentially preclude the economic drilling and completion of wells in certain reservoirs.\nHydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used extensively for decades to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. We routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques on our crude oil and natural gas properties. Hydraulic fracturing involves using mostly water, sand and a small amount of certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to enhance flow of hydrocarbons into the well-bore. The process is typically regulated by state crude oil and natural gas commissions; however, the EPA does assert federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities when diesel comprises part of the fracturing fluid. In addition several agencies of the federal government including the EPA and the BLM are conducting studies of the fracturing stimulation process which may result in additional regulations. In May 2013, the U.S. Department of the Interior re-proposed rules regulating the use of hydraulic fracturing on Federal and Indian Lands, with final action expected in 2015. In addition, legislation has been introduced before Congress, called the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act, to provide the federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process.\nCertain states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. In the event federal, state, local or municipal legal restrictions on the hydraulic fracturing are adopted in areas where we are conducting or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such regulations that may be significant, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from utilizing fracture stimulation and effectively preclude the drilling of wells.\nExploratory and development drilling are speculative activities that may not result in commercially productive reserves. Lack of drilling success could result in uneconomical investments and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDrilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered. There can be no assurance that new wells drilled by us or in which we have an interest will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment. Drilling for oil and gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain. Our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including economic conditions, mechanical problems, pressure or irregularities in formations, title problems, weather conditions, compliance with governmental rules and regulations and shortages in or delays in the delivery of equipment and services. Such equipment shortages and delays are caused by the high demand for rigs and other needed equipment by a large number of companies in active drilling basins. High activity in some basins may cause shortages of rigs and equipment in other basins. Our future drilling activities may not be successful. Lack of drilling success could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could incur additional and substantial write-downs of the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties, which would cause a decrease in our assets and stockholders' equity and could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC on a quarterly basis. This quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test. Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects. In calculating future net revenues, SEC-defined commodity prices and recent costs are utilized. Such prices and costs are utilized except when different prices and costs are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts. Two primary factors in the ceiling test are natural gas and crude oil reserve quantities and SEC-defined crude oil and gas prices, both of which impact the present value of estimated future net revenues. Revisions to estimates of natural gas and crude oil reserves, or an increase or decrease in prices, can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. The amount by which net book value, less deferred income tax, exceeds the tax adjusted net present value of reserves is written off as an expense.\nWe recorded a non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2012 due to the full cost ceiling limitations. Using our year-end reserve information and holding all other variables constant, a price sensitivity analysis indicates it is probable a ceiling impairment charge will occur in 2015 if crude oil and natural gas prices remain at or near the low levels experienced in late 2014 and early 2015. See Note 12 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFINANCING RISKS\nOur credit ratings could be lowered below investment grade in the future. If this were to occur, it could impact our access to capital, our cost of capital and our other operating costs.\nOur issuer credit rating is Baa1 (Stable outlook) by Moody\u2019s; BBB (Stable outlook) by S&P; and BBB+ (Stable outlook) by Fitch. Reduction of our credit ratings could impair our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and to complete new financings on reasonable terms, or at all. A credit rating downgrade, particularly to a sub-investment grade, could also result in counterparties requiring us to post additional collateral under existing or new contracts or trades. In addition, a ratings downgrade would increase our interest expense under some of our existing debt obligations, including borrowings under our credit facilities.\nDerivatives regulations included in current financial reform legislation could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates.\nIn July 2010, Dodd-Frank was passed by Congress and signed into law. Dodd-Frank contains significant derivatives regulations, including a requirement that certain transactions be cleared resulting in a requirement to post cash collateral (commonly referred to as \u201cmargin\u201d) for such transactions. Dodd-Frank provides for a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users such as utilities and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions.\nWe use crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments for our hedging activities for our oil and gas production activities and our gas utility operations. We also use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations. As a result of Dodd-Frank regulations promulgated by the CFTC, we may be required to post collateral to clearing entities for certain swap transactions we enter into. In addition, many of the transactions which were previously classified as swaps have been converted to exchange-traded futures contracts, which are subject to futures margin posting requirements. Such a requirement could have a significant impact on our business by reducing our ability to execute derivative transactions to reduce commodity price and interest rate uncertainty and to protect cash flows. Requirements to post collateral may cause significant liquidity issues by reducing our ability to use cash for investment or other corporate purposes, or may require us to increase our level of debt. In addition, a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral could result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby decreasing our profitability.\nOur hedging activities that are designed to protect against commodity price and financial market risks may cause fluctuations in reported financial results due to accounting requirements associated with such activities.\nWe use various financial contracts and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps to manage commodity price and financial market risks. The timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always match up with the gains or losses on the commodities or assets being hedged. The difference in accounting can result in volatility in reported results, even though the expected profit margin may be essentially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated.\nOur use of derivative financial instruments could result in material financial losses.\nFrom time to time, we have sought to limit a portion of the potential adverse effects resulting from changes in commodity prices and interest rates by using derivative financial instruments and other hedging mechanisms. To the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor. In addition, even though they are closely monitored by management, our hedging activities can result in losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the hedge arrangement, the hedge is economically imperfect, commodity prices or interest rates move unfavorably related to our physical or financial positions, or hedging policies and procedures are not followed.\nMarket performance or changes in other assumptions could require us to make significant unplanned contributions to our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. Increasing costs associated with our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nWe have two defined benefit pension plans and three non-pension postretirement plans that cover certain eligible employees. Assumptions related to future costs, return on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements and the expense recognized related to these plans. These estimates and assumptions may change based on actual return on plan assets, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations.\nWe have a holding company corporate structure with multiple subsidiaries. Corporate dividends and debt payments are dependent upon cash distributions to the holding company from the subsidiaries. The subsidiaries may not be allowed or may be unable to make dividend payments or loan funds to the holding company, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations or pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe are a holding company. Our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets. Our operating cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise. In addition, each subsidiary\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us depends on any applicable contractual or regulatory restrictions that may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash, working capital or debt service funds.\nWe expect to continue our policy of paying regular cash dividends. However, there is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on our future earnings, capital requirements and financial conditions and are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Our operating subsidiaries have certain restrictions on their ability to transfer funds in the form of dividends or loans to us. See \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d within Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these restrictions and their impact on our liquidity.\nWe may be unable to obtain the financing needed to refinance debt, fund planned capital expenditures or otherwise execute our operating strategy. Lack of credit at reasonable rates would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nOur ability to execute our operating strategy is highly dependent upon our access to capital. Historically, we have addressed our liquidity needs (including funds required to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance debt and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures) with operating cash flow, borrowings under credit facilities, proceeds of debt and equity offerings and proceeds from asset sales. Our ability to access the capital markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend on many factors, including changes in our credit ratings, changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies, volatility in commodity or electricity prices and general economic and market conditions.\nIn addition, because we are a holding company and our utility assets are owned by our subsidiaries, if we are unable to adequately access the credit markets, we could be required to take additional measures designed to ensure that our utility subsidiaries are adequately capitalized to provide safe and reliable service. Possible additional measures would be evaluated in the context of then-prevailing market conditions, prudent financial management and any applicable regulatory requirements.\nNational and regional economic conditions may cause increased counterparty credit risk, late payments and uncollectible accounts, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nA future recession may lead to an increase in late payments from retail, commercial and industrial utility customers, as well as our non-utility customers. If late payments and uncollectible accounts increase, earnings and cash flows from our continuing operations may be reduced.\nOur ability to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. Our insurance coverage may not provide protection against all significant losses.\nOur ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost of such insurance, could be affected by developments affecting insurance businesses, international, national, state or local events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all, or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to us. A loss for which we are not fully insured could materially and adversely affect our financial results. Our insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which the Company may be subject, including but not limited to environmental hazards, fire-related liability from natural events or inadequate facility maintenance, risks associated with our oil and gas exploration and production activities, distribution property losses, cyber-security risks and dangers that exist in the gathering and transportation in pipelines.\nOur operations are also subject to all the hazards and risks normally incident to the development, exploitation, production and transportation of, and the exploration for, oil and gas, including unusual or unexpected geologic formations, pressures, down hole fires, mechanical failures, blowouts, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, gas or well fluids, pollution and other environmental risks. These hazards could result in substantial losses to us due to injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage and suspension of operations. We maintain insurance coverage for our operated wells and we participate in insurance coverage maintained by the operators of our wells, although there can be no assurances that such coverage will be sufficient to prevent a material adverse effect to us if any of the foregoing events occur.\nIncreasing costs associated with our health care plans and other benefits may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nThe costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years. We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to health care plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise. The increasing costs and funding requirements associated with our health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nIn March 2010, the President of the United States signed PPACA as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201c2010 Acts\u201d). The 2010 Acts will have a substantial impact on health care providers, insurers, employers and individuals. The 2010 Acts will impact employers and businesses differently depending on the size of the organization and the specific impacts on a company\u2019s employees. Certain provisions of the 2010 Acts are effective while other provisions of the 2010 Acts will be effective in future years. The 2010 Acts could require, among other things, changes to our current employee benefit plans and in our administrative and accounting processes, as well as changes to the cost of our plans. The ultimate extent and cost of these changes cannot be determined at this time and are being evaluated and updated as related regulations and interpretations of the 2010 Acts become available.\nOur electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. Within our utility rates we have generally recovered the cost of providing employee benefits. As benefit costs continue to rise, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will allow recovery.\nWe have deferred a substantial amount of income tax related to various tax planning strategies, including the deferral of a gain associated with the assets sold in the IPP Transaction. If the Internal Revenue Service successfully challenges these tax positions, our results of operations, financial position or liquidity could be adversely affected.\nWe have deferred a substantial amount of tax payments through various tax planning strategies including the deferral of approximately $125 million in income taxes associated with a like-kind exchange related to the IPP Transaction and the Aquila Transaction.\nThe IRS has challenged our position with respect to the like-kind exchange. As stated in a revised Notice of Proposed Adjustment received from the IRS in April 2013, their position is to disallow a significant portion of the gain deferred as reported on our originally filed 2008 tax return. A 30 Day Letter along with a Revenue Agent's Report were received on July 30, 2014, indicating no change in the IRS' position. We disagree with such a position and will pursue all available IRS and/or legal channels to challenge the proposed adjustment. A protest was timely filed with IRS Appeals in August 2014. In the event we are unsuccessful in our challenge, the amount of deferred income tax on a worst case basis that could be accelerated into a current taxes payable based on the revised NOPA would be approximately $88 million. However, we would be entitled to a cash tax benefit associated with the additional tax depreciation that would result from increasing the depreciable cost for tax purposes in the assets acquired. This net current tax liability would accrue interest, which is estimated to be approximately $19 million before income tax effect.\nIn certain circumstances, the IRS may assess penalties when challenging our tax positions. If we were unsuccessful in defending against these penalties, it may have a material impact on our results of operations. No penalties have been assessed by the IRS in connection with the like-kind exchange transaction.\nAn effective system of internal control may not be maintained, leading to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to make an assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal controls. Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of these controls. During their assessment of these controls, management or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify areas of weakness in control design or effectiveness, which may lead to the conclusion that a material weakness in internal control exists. Any control deficiencies we identify in the future could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity.\nENVIRONMENTAL RISKS\nFederal and state laws concerning greenhouse gas regulations and air emissions may materially increase our generation and production costs and could render some of our generating units uneconomical to operate and maintain.\nWe own and operate regulated and non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants in South Dakota, Wyoming and Colorado. Recent developments under federal and state laws and regulations governing air emissions from fossil-fuel generating plants will likely result in more stringent emission limitations, which could have a material impact on our costs of operations. Various pending or final state and EPA regulations that will impact our facilities are also discussed in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption \u201cEnvironmental Matters.\u201d\nOn May 20, 2011, with amendments on December 21, 2012, the EPA\u2019s Industrial and Commercial Boiler regulations became effective, which provide for hazardous air pollutant-related emission limits and monitoring requirements. The compliance deadline for this rule was March 21, 2014. Engineering evaluations were completed and confirmed the significant impact on our Neil Simpson I, Osage and Ben French facilities. These units were permanently retired on March 21, 2014. We have requested recovery for the remaining net book values of these plants and prudent decommissioning costs of these units. The WPSC granted approval to our request in the Wyoming rate case approved in August 2014, and our request with the SDPUC is pending with a decision expected in March 2015.\nOn February 16, 2012, the EPA published in the Federal Register the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from Coal and Oil Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units (MATS), with an effective date of April 16, 2012. Affected units have a compliance deadline of April 16, 2015, with a pathway defined to apply for a one year extension due to certain circumstances. It is expected that all of our plants will be in compliance by the initial 2015 deadline, with the primary impacts to Neil Simpson II, Wygen I, Wygen II, Wygen III and the Wyodak Plant including installation of mercury sorbent injection systems, along with additional monitoring and testing requirements.\nThe GHG Tailoring Rule, implementing regulations of GHG for permitting purposes, became effective in June 2010. This rule will impact us in the event of a major modification at an existing facility or in the event of a new major source as defined by EPA regulations. Upon renewal of operating permits for existing facilities, monitoring and reporting requirements will be implemented. New projects or major modifications to existing projects will result in a Best Available Control Technology review that could impose more stringent emissions control practices and technologies. The EPA\u2019s GHG New Source Performance Standard for new steam electric generating units was expected to be final by the end of 2014. As proposed, it effectively prohibits new coal fired units until carbon capture and sequestration becomes technically and economically feasible. It also effectively prohibits simple cycle natural gas combustion turbines from generating more than one-third of their capacity, averaged over a three year period. The rule was not finalized in 2014 and may be delayed to June 2015 to coincide with issuance of the Clean Power Plan regulations.\nOn June 2, 2014, the EPA proposed the Clean Power Plan to cut carbon emissions from existing electric generating units. The design of the Clean Power Plan is to decrease existing coal-fired generation, increase the utilization of existing gas generation, increase renewable energy and demand side management. This rule could have a significant impact on our coal and natural gas generating fleet. The rule calls for states to develop plans to meet their assigned emission rate targets by 2030. The rule also allows states to formulate a regional approach whereby they would join with other states and be assigned a new single target for the group. We are currently evaluating this proposal, but cannot predict the impact on operations as this rule is expected to be final in June 2015. State plans are expected to be due at the earliest in June 2016, with extensions possible to 2017 and 2018.\nDue to uncertainty as to the final outcome of federal climate change legislation, or regulatory changes under the Clean Air Act, we cannot definitively estimate the effect of GHG legislation or regulation on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The impact of GHG legislation or regulation on our company will depend upon many factors, including but not limited to, the timing of implementation, the GHG sources that are regulated, the overall GHG emissions cap level and the availability of technologies to control or reduce GHG emissions. If a \u201ccap and trade\u201d structure is implemented, the impact will depend on the degree to which offsets are allowed, the allocation of emission allowances to specific sources and the effect of carbon regulation on natural gas and coal prices.\nNew or more stringent regulations or other energy efficiency requirements could require us to incur significant additional costs relating to, among other things, the installation of additional emission control equipment, the acceleration of capital expenditures, the purchase of additional emissions allowances or offsets, the acquisition or development of additional energy supply from renewable resources and the closure of certain generating facilities. To the extent our regulated fossil-fuel generating plants are included in rate base we will attempt to recover costs associated with complying with emission standards or other requirements. We will also attempt to recover the emission compliance costs of our non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants from utility and other purchasers of the power generated by those non-regulated power plants. Any unrecovered costs could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, future changes in environmental regulations governing air emissions could render some of our power generating units more expensive or uneconomical to operate and maintain.\nThe failure to achieve or maintain compliance with existing or future governmental laws, regulations or requirements could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Additionally, the potentially high cost of complying with such requirements or addressing environmental liabilities could also adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nOur business is subject to extensive energy, environmental and other laws and regulations of federal, state, tribal and local authorities. We generally must obtain and comply with a variety of regulations, licenses, permits and other approvals in order to operate, which can require significant capital expenditure and operating costs. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and the imposition of penalties, liens or fines, claims for property damage or personal injury, or environmental clean-up costs. In addition, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities, which could require additional unexpected expenditures or cause us to reevaluate the feasibility of continued operations at certain sites and have a detrimental effect on our business.\nIn connection with certain acquisitions, we assumed liabilities associated with the environmental condition of certain properties, regardless of when such liabilities arose, whether known or unknown, and in some cases agreed to indemnify the former owners of those properties for environmental liabilities. Future steps to bring our facilities into compliance or to address contamination from legacy operations, if necessary, could be expensive and could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition. We expect our environmental compliance expenditures to be substantial in the future due to the continuing trends toward stricter standards, greater regulation, more extensive permitting requirements and an increase in the number of assets we operate.\nThe characteristics of coal may make it difficult for coal users to comply with various environmental standards related to coal combustion or utilization and the use of alternative energy sources for power generation as mandated by states could reduce coal consumption. As a result, coal users may switch to other fuels, which would affect the volume of our sales and the price of our products.\nCoal contains impurities, including but not limited to sulfur, mercury, chlorine, carbon and other elements or compounds, many of which are released into the air when coal is burned. More stringent environmental regulations of emissions from coal-fueled power plants could increase the costs of using coal, thereby reducing demand for coal as a fuel source and the volume and price of our coal sales. Renewable energy requirements and changes to regulations could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of power plants in the future.\nProposed reductions in emissions of mercury, sulfur dioxides, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, or greenhouse gases may require the installation of costly emission control technology or the implementation of other measures. For example, in order to meet the federal Clean Air Act limits for SO2 emission from power plants, coal users may need to install scrubbers, use SO2 emission allowances (some of which they may purchase), blend high-sulfur coal with low-sulfur coal or switch to other fuels. Reductions in mercury emission required by certain states and the EPA will likely require some power plants to install new equipment, at substantial cost, or discourage the use of certain coals containing higher levels of mercury. On June 2, 2014, the EPA proposed the Clean Power Plan to cut carbon emissions from existing electric generating units. The design of the Clean Power Plan is to decrease existing coal-fired generation, increase the utilization of existing gas generation, increase renewable energy and demand side management. This rule could have a significant impact on our coal and natural gas generating fleet. The rule calls for states to develop plans to meet their assigned emission rate targets by 2030. The rule also allows states to formulate a regional approach whereby they would join with other states and be assigned a new single target for the group. We are currently evaluating this proposal, but cannot predict the impact on operations as this rule is expected to be final in June 2015. State plans are expected to be due at the earliest in June 2016, with extensions possible to 2017 and 2018.\nCoal competes with other energy sources, such as natural gas, wind, solar and hydropower. If the Clean Power Plan Rule regulations were to have an adverse effect on coal as a domestic energy source, this rule could have a significant impact on our coal mining operations.\nExisting or proposed legislation focusing on emissions enacted by the United States or individual states could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative for our customers and could impose a tax or fee on the producer of the coal. If our customers decrease the volume of coal they purchase from us or switch to alternative fuels as a result of existing or future environmental regulations aimed at reducing emissions, our operations and financial results could be adversely impacted.", "PERMNO": 61946, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "BKH"}
