{"cik": "12208", "company": "BIO RAD LABORATORIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-04-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn evaluating our business and whether to invest in any of our securities, you should carefully read the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report. We believe that any of the following risks could have a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, our industry or the trading price of our common stock. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time. We cannot predict these new risks and uncertainties, nor can we assess the extent to which any such new risks and uncertainties or the extent to which the risks and uncertainties set forth below may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, our industry or the trading price of our common stock.\nOur settlement with government agencies in connection with violations by us of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs previously disclosed, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and consented to the entry of an Order by the SEC (SEC Order), effective November 3, 2014, which actions resolved both the DOJ and the SEC investigations into our violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Under the terms of the NPA and the SEC Order, we agreed to pay a financial penalty and certain amounts in disgorgement and interest as well as to compliance, reporting and cooperation obligations to be performed for two years. On October 28, 2016, the DOJ and SEC informed Bio-Rad that they did not intend to extend the NPA after it expired November 2, 2016.\nWhether by virtue of disclosure of the NPA and the SEC Order or otherwise, we may be subject to investigations by foreign governments or further claims by third parties arising from conduct subject to the investigation or our other international operations. For additional information regarding further claims by third parties, see Note 13, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Many of our customers in our significant international operations are government agencies or state-owned or state-controlled universities, hospitals and laboratories. The disclosure of the NPA and the SEC Order and any further violations of the FCPA could harm our reputation with these customers, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any further violations of the FCPA also could result in more punitive actions by the SEC and DOJ, which also could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur international operations expose us to additional costs and legal and regulatory risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have significant international operations. We have direct distribution channels in over 35 countries outside the United States, and in 2017 our foreign subsidiaries generated 63% of our net sales. Compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include, among others, data privacy requirements (including with respect to the invalidation of the U.S.-European Union safe harbor by the European Court of Justice in October 2015, compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield adopted by the European Commission in July 2016, and the requirements for compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation, which takes effect May 25, 2018), labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, export requirements, U.S. laws such as the FCPA and other U.S. federal laws and regulations established by the office of Foreign Asset Control, foreign laws such as the UK Bribery Act 2010 or other foreign laws which prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers.\nGiven the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that we may inadvertently breach some provisions, for example, through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements, or otherwise. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these challenges through policies, procedures and internal controls. However, we have a dispersed international sales organization, and we use distributors and agents in many of our international operations. This structure makes it more difficult for us to ensure that our international selling operations comply with our global policies and procedures.\nViolations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Violations of laws and regulations also could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, or our business, results of operations and financial condition. See also our risk factor regarding government regulations below.\nThe industries and market segments in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe life science and clinical diagnostics markets are each highly competitive. Some of our competitors have merged, and some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do and are less leveraged than we are, making them better equipped to license technologies and intellectual property from third parties or to fund research and development, manufacturing and marketing efforts. Moreover, competitive and regulatory conditions in many markets in which we operate restrict our ability to fully recover, through price increases, higher costs of acquired goods and services resulting from inflation and other drivers of cost increases. Many public tenders have become more competitive due to governments lengthening the commitments of their public tenders to multiple years, which reduce the number of tenders in which we can participate annually. Because the value of these multiple-year tenders is so high, our competitors have been more aggressive with their pricing. Our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from competition could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to grow our business because of our failure to develop new or improved products.\nOur future growth depends in part on our ability to continue to improve our product offerings and develop and introduce new product lines and extensions that integrate technological advances. In particular, we may not be able to keep up with changes in the clinical diagnostics industry, such as the trend toward molecular diagnostics or point-of-care tests. If we are unable to integrate technological advances into our product offerings or to design, develop, manufacture and market new product lines and extensions successfully and in a timely manner, our business, results\nof operations and financial condition will be adversely affected. We have experienced product launch delays in the past, and may do so in the future. We cannot assure you that our product and process development efforts will be successful or that new products we introduce will achieve market acceptance. Failure to launch successful new products or improvements to existing products may cause our products to become obsolete, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs stated above, a significant portion of our operations and sales are outside of the United States. When we make purchases and sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollars, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our international sales are largely denominated in local currencies. As a result, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar negatively impacts our consolidated net sales expressed in U.S. dollars. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, our expenses at our international sites increase. In addition, the volatility of other currencies, such as the Swiss Franc, Brazilian Real and Russian Ruble, may negatively impact our operations outside of the United States and increase our costs to hedge against currency fluctuations. We cannot assure you that future shifts in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may experience difficulties implementing our new global enterprise resource planning system.\nWe are engaged in a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system (ERP). The ERP is designed to efficiently maintain our books and records and provide information important to the operation of our business to our management team. The ERP will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources. In implementing the ERP, we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the ERP could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship product, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. For example, we experienced system implementation issues in our Clinical Diagnostics segment during our first deployment that impacted invoicing and caused an increase in accounts receivable. In our second deployment, we experienced delays in manufacturing and logistics, which adversely impacted our sales. We launched our third deployment in Western Europe in April 2017. We have experienced system implementation issues impacting the timing of payment of vendor invoices and resulting in delays in product availability and shipments. We also have experienced lower productivity levels related to the April 2017 go-live of the ERP in Western Europe, which adversely impacted our sales during the second and third quarters of 2017. The third deployment was more complex than our prior deployments due to its scope. While we invested significant resources in planning, project management and training, additional and significant implementation issues may arise. In addition, our efforts to centralize various business processes and functions within our organization in connection with our ERP implementation may continue to disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRecent and planned changes to our organizational structure and executive management team could negatively impact our business.\nWe made significant changes to our organizational structure in 2014, 2015 and 2016, and we continued to make significant organizational changes in 2017. In 2014 and 2015, we functionalized our manufacturing and selling organizations globally and separated them from our marketing and research and development organizations. Specifically, we combined our international selling organization with our North American selling divisions into one global selling group and consolidated our manufacturing, procurement and logistics operations into one global supply chain group. We also created new management positions to head each of these groups. In addition, we appointed new executives to head each of our Life Science and Clinical Diagnostics segments, and we appointed a Chief Operating Officer. We also restructured our Life Science segment based on functional groups rather than product line divisions. In 2016, we began implementing the reorganization of the structure of our European organization. We continued to implement the reorganization of our European organization in 2017. These changes may have unintended consequences, such as distraction of our management and employees, business disruption,\nattrition of our workforce, inability to attract or retain key employees, and reduced employee morale or productivity.\nOur failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements, our failure to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which in turn could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nMaintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements. During the third quarter of 2017, we identified two items that were recorded in the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 that should have been recorded in the three-month period ended June 30, 2017. In each case, the misrecorded item was due to errors as a result of data migration and system configuration arising from our new European business structure during our ERP system conversion in Europe in April 2017. Our review controls and our user acceptance testing controls were not sufficiently designed to identify these items on a timely basis. Though there was no impact on the financial statements for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of September 30, 2017 and that this deficiency constituted a material weakness. Our management believes that our enhanced post-conversion management review control activities and augmented user acceptance testing of system changes, which were designed to remediate the material weakness over financial reporting disclosed as of September 30, 2017, were sufficiently implemented as of December 31, 2017.\nIn connection with our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, we determined that we did not maintain a sufficient complement of personnel in certain European countries with appropriate training and expertise in accounting and reporting in the new ERP system following the system conversion and European reorganization that the Company undertook in April 2017, including the implementation of reporting lines, appropriate authorities and responsibilities within and between our accounting and reporting function, information technology and the business operations in these European countries. We did not conduct continuous risk assessment over changes in our European business operations, IT systems and personnel to identify and assess necessary changes in internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we did not design effective control activities over the accounting for financial statement amounts, including inventory and revenue, reported by entities impacted by the European reorganization, including management review controls with sufficient precision to identify and investigate potential outliers. These control deficiencies resulted in immaterial misstatements to inventory, revenue and cost of goods sold, certain of which were corrected in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017, prior to issuance.\nBecause the deficiencies create a reasonable possibility of material misstatement in the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, they represent a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting and accordingly, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2017. KPMG, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of the audit, has issued an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017.\nIn response to this evaluation and assessment, our management is enhancing its control environment in the entities impacted by the ERP system conversion and European reorganization by (i) increasing resources with sufficient accounting and reporting expertise within our reorganized business and using our new ERP system, (ii) implementing and monitoring reporting lines and appropriate authorities and responsibilities within the accounting and reporting function, information technology and the business operations, and (iii) providing training to our control owners to effectively perform controls in the new environment including training on reconciliation review controls and certain ERP system enhancements. Our management is also enhancing its risk assessment process to continuously assess the potential impact on internal control over financial reporting of changes to business operations, including changes relating to similar ERP system conversions and reorganizations that may occur in the future. In addition, our management also is in the process of designing additional control activities over financial\nstatement amounts reported by entities impacted by the European reorganization. However, we cannot assure you that these efforts will be effective in timely remediating the material weakness or that additional deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future.\nSuch material weaknesses have adversely affected us in the past and could affect us in the future, and the results of our periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure to maintain or implement new or improved internal controls, or any difficulties that we may encounter in their maintenance or implementation, could result in additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. This could cause us to lose public confidence, and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. For further information regarding our controls and procedures, see Part II, Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBreaches of our information systems could have material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThrough our sales and eCommerce channels, we collect and store confidential information that customers provide to, among other things, purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs and register on our Web site. We also acquire and retain information about suppliers and employees in the normal course of business. We also create and maintain proprietary information that is critical to our business, such as our product designs and manufacturing processes. Despite recent initiatives to improve our technology systems, such as our enterprise resource planning implementation and the centralization of our global information technology organization, we could experience a significant data security breach. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors\u2019 information systems and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer, supplier, employee or other business information, such as our intellectual property. Third parties could also gain control of our systems and use them for criminal purposes while appearing to be us. As a result, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, be exposed to claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations, employees and other persons, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, incur additional expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach, or suffer other adverse consequences. Our operations and ability to process sales orders, particularly through our eCommerce channels, could also be disrupted. Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, corruption, or destruction of our systems, as well as any data breaches, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. See also our risk factors regarding our ERP implementation above and our information technology systems below.\nRisks relating to intellectual property rights may negatively impact our business.\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret, patent and trademark laws and third-party nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights and products. However, we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable, or that meaningful protection or adequate remedies will be available to us. For instance, unauthorized third parties have attempted to copy our intellectual property, reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary, or have developed equivalent technologies independently, and may do so in the future. Additionally, third parties have asserted patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us, and may do so in the future. If we are unable to license or otherwise access protected technology used in our products, or if we lose our rights under any existing licenses, we could be prohibited from manufacturing and marketing such products. From time to time, we also must enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others through litigation. As a result, we could incur substantial costs, be forced to redesign our products, or be required to pay damages to an infringed party. Any of the foregoing matters could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGlobal economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our operations.\nIn recent years, we have been faced with very challenging global economic conditions. A deterioration in the global economic environment may result in decreased demand for our products, increased competition, downward pressure on the prices for our products and longer sales cycles. A weakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers, which could result in interruptions in supply in the future. We have also experienced delays in collecting receivables in certain countries in Western Europe, and we may experience similar delays in these and other countries or regions experiencing liquidity problems. As of December 31, 2017, we had accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal of $41.0 million. In addition, a slowing of growth in the Chinese economy and in emerging markets, especially those oil-producing countries that have been affected by the decline in oil prices, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We also are monitoring developments following the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union to determine if there will be any potential impact on our business.\nReductions in government funding and the capital spending programs of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur customers include universities, clinical diagnostics laboratories, government agencies, hospitals and pharmaceutical, biotechnology and chemical companies. The capital spending programs of these institutions and companies have a significant effect on the demand for our products. Such programs are based on a wide variety of factors, including the resources available to make such purchases, the availability of funding from grants by governments or government agencies, the spending priorities for various types of equipment and the policies regarding capital expenditures during industry downturns or recessionary periods. If government funding to our customers were to decrease, or if our customers were to decrease or reallocate their budgets in a manner adverse to us, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere have been, and will continue to be, significant changes in the healthcare industry in an effort to reduce costs. These changes include:\n\u2022\nThe trend towards managed care, together with healthcare reform of the delivery system in the United States and efforts to reform in Europe, has resulted in increased pressure on healthcare providers and other participants in the healthcare industry to reduce selling prices. Consolidation among healthcare providers and consolidation among other participants in the healthcare industry has resulted in fewer, more powerful groups, whose purchasing power gives them cost containment leverage. In particular, there has been a consolidation of laboratories and a consolidation of blood transfusion centers. These industry trends and competitive forces place constraints on the levels of overall pricing, and thus could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins for products we sell in clinical diagnostic markets.\n\u2022\nThird party payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, have reduced their reimbursements for certain medical products and services. Our Clinical Diagnostics business is impacted by the level of reimbursement available for clinical tests from third party payors. In the United States payment for many diagnostic tests furnished to Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries is made based on the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS), a fee schedule established and adjusted from time to time by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Some commercial payors are guided by the CLFS in establishing their reimbursement rates. Clinicians may decide not to order clinical diagnostic tests if third party payments are inadequate, and we cannot predict whether third party payors will offer adequate reimbursement for tests utilizing our products to make them commercially attractive. Legislation, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (PPACA) and the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, has reduced\nthe payments for clinical laboratory services paid under the CLFS. In addition, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA) has made significant changes to the way Medicare will pay for clinical laboratory services, which has further reduced reimbursement rates.\n\u2022\nThe PPACA has also imposed a 2.3% excise tax on the sales of certain medical devices in the U.S., which we are required to pay on most of our United States Clinical Diagnostic sales. However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Pub. L. 114-113), signed into law on December 18, 2015, included a two year moratorium on the medical device excise tax. On January 22, 2018, the moratorium on the medical device excise tax was further extended until January 1, 2020.\nTo the extent that the healthcare industry seeks to address the need to contain costs stemming from reform measures such as those contained in the PPACA and the PAMA, or in future legislation, by limiting the number of clinical tests being performed or the amount of reimbursement available for such tests, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. If these changes in the healthcare markets in the United States and Europe continue, we could be forced to alter our approach in selling, marketing, distributing and servicing our products.\nWe are subject to substantial government regulation, and any changes in regulation or violations of regulations by us could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.\nSome of our products (primarily our Clinical Diagnostic products), production processes and marketing are subject to U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign regulation, including by the FDA in the United States and its foreign counterparts. The FDA regulates our Clinical Diagnostic products as medical devices, and we are subject to significant regulatory clearances or approvals to market our Clinical Diagnostic products and other requirements including, for example, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, such as the FDA\u2019s medical device reporting regulations and reporting of corrections and removals. The FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can impose a variety of enforcement actions ranging from public warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals, seizure or recall of our products, total or partial shutdown of production, withdrawal of approvals or clearances already granted, and criminal prosecution.\nThe FDA can also require us to repair, replace or refund the cost of devices that we manufactured or distributed.\nIn addition, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions, which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis. Changes in the FDA\u2019s review of certain clinical diagnostic products referred to as laboratory developed tests, which are tests developed by a single laboratory for use only in that laboratory, could affect some of our customers who use our Life Science instruments for laboratory developed tests. In the past, the FDA has chosen to not enforce applicable regulations and has not reviewed such tests for approval. However, the FDA has issued draft guidance that it may begin enforcing its medical device requirements, including premarket submission requirements, to such tests. Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, clearance or approval for our products could prevent us from generating revenue from these products and adversely affect our business operations and financial results. Additionally, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Regulatory enforcement or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our products and dissuade our customers from using our products.\nMany foreign governments have similar rules and regulations regarding the importation, registration, labeling, sale and use of our products. Such agencies may also impose new requirements that may require us to modify or re-register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries. For example, in April 2017 the European Parliament voted to enact final regulations that include broad changes to its regulations regarding in vitro diagnostic devices and medical devices, including stricter product labeling requirements, Russia has enacted more stringent medical product registration and labeling regulations, China has enacted stricter labeling requirements, and we expect other countries, such as Brazil and India, to impose more regulations that impact our product registrations. Due to these evolving and diverse requirements, we face\nuncertain product approval timelines, additional time and effort to comply, reduced sales and potential fines for noncompliance. Increasing protectionism in such countries also impedes our ability to compete with local companies. For example, we may not be able to participate in certain public tenders in Russia because of increasing measures to restrict access to such tenders for companies without local manufacturing capabilities. Such regulations could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are also subject to government regulation of the use and handling of a number of materials and controlled substances. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements for controlled substances pursuant to the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. Failure to comply with present or future laws and regulations could result in substantial liability to us, suspension or cessation of our operations, restrictions on our ability to expand at our present locations or require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur other significant expenses.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate acquired companies, products or technologies into our company successfully, or we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisitions.\nAs part of our overall business strategy, we pursue acquisitions of and investments in complementary companies, products and technologies. In order to be successful in these activities, we must, among other things:\n\u2022\nassimilate the operations and personnel of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nretain acquired business customers;\n\u2022\nminimize potential disruption to our ongoing business;\n\u2022\nretain key technical and management personnel;\n\u2022\nintegrate acquired companies into our strategic and financial plans;\n\u2022\naccurately assess the value of target companies, products and technologies;\n\u2022\ncomply with new regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nharmonize standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nminimize the impact to our relationships with our employees and customers; and\n\u2022\nassess, document and remediate any deficiencies in disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nThe benefits of any acquisition may prove to be less than anticipated and may not outweigh the costs reported in our financial statements. Completing any potential future acquisitions could cause significant diversion of our management\u2019s time and resources. If we acquire new companies, products or technologies, we may be required to assume contingent liabilities or record impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets over time. We cannot assure you that we will successfully overcome these risks or any other problems we encounter in connection with any acquisitions, and any such acquisitions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nProduct quality and liability issues could harm our reputation and negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe must adequately address quality issues associated with our products, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. Our instruments, reagents and consumables are complex, and identifying the root cause of quality issues, especially those affecting reagents or third-party components, is difficult. We may incur significant costs and expend substantial time in researching and remediating such issues. Quality issues could also delay our launching or manufacturing of new products. In addition, quality issues, unapproved uses of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks related to our products, could result in product recalls or product liability or other claims being brought against us. These issues could harm our reputation, impair our relationship with existing customers and harm our ability to attract new customers, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLack of key personnel could hurt our business.\nOur products are very technical in nature. In general, only highly qualified and well-trained scientists have the necessary skills to develop, market and sell our products, and many of our manufacturing positions require very specialized knowledge and skills. In addition, the global nature of our business also requires that we have sophisticated and experienced staff to comply with increasingly complex international laws and regulations. We face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors, customers, marketing partners and other companies throughout our industry. In particular, the job market in Northern California, where many of our employees are located, is very competitive. If we do not offer competitive compensation and benefits, we may fail to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified personnel, which could impair our ability to properly run our business.\nIn some cases we rely on temporary personnel or consultants, and we may do so in the future. Such temporary personnel or consultants may lack the knowledge and/or specific skills necessary for our business, require time to train without benefiting us through extended employment and increase our costs. In addition, as noted above, our strategic initiatives, such as our internal restructuring and ERP implementation, may be burdensome and disruptive and lead to employee dissatisfaction and attrition.\nA reduction or interruption in the supply of components and raw materials could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales.\nThe manufacture of many of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials. We manufacture our products in numerous manufacturing facilities around the world. We acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful. Further, while we seek to diversify our sources of components and materials, in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier. In addition, due to the regulatory environment in which we operate, we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials. If our supply is reduced or interrupted or of poor quality, and we are unable to develop alternative sources for such supply, our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or cost-effective manner could be adversely affected, which would adversely affect our ability to sell our products.\nIf our information technology systems are disrupted, or if we fail to successfully implement, manage and integrate our information technology and reporting systems, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur information technology (IT) systems are an integral part of our business, and a serious disruption of our IT systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We depend on our IT systems to process orders, manage inventory and collect accounts receivable. Our IT systems also allow us to efficiently purchase products from our suppliers and ship products to our customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations and provide customer service. We may experience disruption of our IT systems due to redundancy issues with our network servers. We cannot assure you that our contingency plans will allow us to operate at our current level of efficiency.\nOur ability to implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning, reporting and analytical processes. We expect that we will need to continue to improve and further integrate our IT systems, reporting systems and operating procedures by training and educating our employees with respect to these improvements and integrations on an ongoing basis in order to effectively run our business. We may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality when we upgrade or change systems. If we fail to successfully manage and integrate our IT systems, reporting systems and operating procedures, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See also our risk factors regarding our ERP implementation and data security above and events beyond our control below.\nNatural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war or other events beyond our control may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees, facilities, information systems, security systems, vendors and customers, which could significantly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities, including in the western United States, France, Switzerland, Germany and Singapore. In particular, the western United States has experienced a number of earthquakes, wildfires, floods, landslides and other natural disasters in recent years. These occurrences could damage or destroy our facilities which may result in interruptions to our business and losses that exceed our insurance coverage. In addition, strikes or other labor unrest at any of our sites or surrounding areas could cause disruption to our business.\nActs of terrorism, bioterrorism, violence or war could also affect the markets in which we operate, our business operations and strategic plans. Political unrest may affect our sales in certain regions, such as in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may have higher than anticipated tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. We report our results of operations based on our determination of the amount of taxes owed in various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation, judgment and calculations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain. Our determination of tax liability is always subject to review or examination by tax authorities in various tax jurisdictions. Tax authorities have disagreed with our judgment in the past and may disagree with positions we take in the future resulting in assessments of additional taxes. Any adverse outcome of such review or examination could have a negative impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nEconomic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. For example, in recent years, the tax authorities in Europe have disagreed with our tax positions related to hybrid debt, research and development credits, transfer pricing and indirect taxes, among others. We regularly assess the likelihood of the outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\nThe results from various tax examinations, audits and litigation may differ from the liabilities recorded in our financial statements and could materially and adversely affect our financial results and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nChanges in tax laws or rates, changes in the interpretation of tax laws or changes in the jurisdictional mix of our earnings could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act made a number of substantial changes, including, among other changes, the imposition of a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on previously unrepatriated earnings accumulated offshore since 1986, establishment of a global minimum income tax and base erosion tax provisions related to offshore activities and affiliated party payments, and reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for US taxable income, resulting in a one-time remeasurement of deferred taxes to reflect their value at a lower tax rate of 21%. These changes to U.S. tax laws will significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings.\nTo determine the transition tax, the Tax Act requires complex computations not previously provided in U.S. tax law, including calculating and supporting with primary evidence U.S. tax attributes such as accumulated foreign earnings and profits, foreign taxes paid, and other tax components involved in foreign tax credit calculations since\n1986. The application of accounting guidance for such items is currently uncertain, and compliance with the Tax Act and the accounting for such provisions require collection of information not previously required, regularly produced or within our control. As a result, these provisional tax amounts recorded are based on our reasonable estimate and we will need additional information to complete our assessment. As additional regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities, as accounting treatment is clarified, as we perform additional analysis on the application of the Tax Act, and as we refine estimates in calculating the effect, our final analysis, which will be recorded in the period completed, may be materially different from our current provisional amounts, which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nWe are still evaluating the tax provisions related to two new U.S. tax base erosion provisions, the base-erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT) provisions and the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) provisions. The BEAT provisions in the Tax Reform Act eliminate the deduction of certain base-erosion payments made to related foreign corporations, and impose a minimum tax if greater than regular tax. The GILTI provisions require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary\u2019s tangible assets. We are not yet able to reasonably estimate the effect of the BEAT and GILTI provisions of the Tax Act.\nOur global operations subject us to income and other taxes in the U.S. and in numerous foreign jurisdictions, each with different tax schemes and tax rates. In addition to the changes in tax laws, the interpretation of tax laws and tax rates in these jurisdictions, the jurisdictional mix of our earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates can have a significant impact on our effective tax rate from period to period.\nThe liability for the transition tax, changes to the provisional tax amounts, and other ongoing effects of the Tax Act, including the effect of our investment in Sartorius, and the jurisdictional mix of our earnings could materially affect our financial results and cash flow.\nIn addition, the adoption of some or all of the recommendations set forth in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s project on \u201cBase Erosion and Profit Shifting\u201d (BEPS) by tax authorities in the countries in which we operate, could negatively impact our effective tax rate. These recommendations focus on payments from affiliates in high tax jurisdictions to affiliates in lower tax jurisdictions and the activities that give rise to a taxable presence in particular country.\nOur reported financial results may be materially affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\nFor example, in January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01, \"Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\" Amendments under ASU 2016-01, among other items, require that all equity investments in unconsolidated entities (other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting), such as our investment in the preferred shares of Sartorius AG, will generally be measured at fair value through earnings. Entities may elect to record equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, and plus or minus subsequent adjustments for observable price changes. Changes in the basis of these equity investments will be reported in current earnings. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We expect that the impact of adoption of ASU 2016-01 will materially impact our consolidated statement of income due to our ownership of preferred shares of Sartorius AG. In future periods after adoption, changes in the market value of the preferred shares of Sartorius AG along with our other equity investments may materially impact our consolidated statement of income.\nEnvironmental, health and safety regulations and enforcement proceedings may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods, emissions to air and discharges to water, as well as handling and disposal practices for solid, hazardous and medical wastes. In addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations, we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liability and clean-up responsibility for spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate. The environmental laws and regulations also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills, disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the United States and abroad in connection with our operations.\nWe may in the future incur capital and operating costs to comply with currently existing laws and regulations, and possible new statutory enactments, and these expenditures may be significant. We have incurred, and may in the future incur, fines related to environmental matters and/or liability for costs or damages related to spills or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment at sites where we have operated, or at off-site locations where we have sent hazardous substances for disposal. We cannot assure you, however, that such matters or any future obligations to comply with environmental or health and safety laws and regulations will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur debt may restrict our future operations.\nWe have substantial debt and have the ability to incur additional debt. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $435.0 million of outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we have a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $200.0 million, $0.5 million of which has been utilized for domestic standby letters of credit. Our incurrence of substantial amounts of debt may have important consequences. For instance, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to our outstanding debt;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which will reduce funds available for other business purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared with some of our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing required to fund working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes.\nOur existing credit facility and the terms of our other debt instruments, including agreements we may enter in the future, contain or will contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place restrictions on our ability to, among other things: incur additional debt; acquire other businesses or assets through merger or purchase; create liens; make investments; enter into transactions with affiliates; sell assets; in the case of some of our subsidiaries, guarantee debt; and declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders. Our existing credit facility also requires that we comply with certain financial ratios, including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio test and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio test.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of these restrictions could result in a default. An event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, acceleration of our other\nindebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on our outstanding notes and repay the principal amount of our outstanding notes or may cause the future subsidiary guarantors, if any, to be unable to make payments under the guarantees.\nWe are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws.\nWe are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the U.S. federal government and the U.S. states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These healthcare laws and regulations include, for example:\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in return for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase order or recommendation of, any item or services for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nU.S. federal false claims laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. In addition, the U.S. federal government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, biologics, devices and medical supplies to record any transfers of value to U.S. physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals;\n\u2022\nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\"HIPAA\"), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; and\n\u2022\nstate or foreign law equivalents of each of the U.S. federal laws above, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.\nThese laws will continue to impose administrative, cost and compliance burdens on us. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of these requirements. In addition, any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur losses in future periods due to write-downs in the value of financial instruments.\nWe have positions in a variety of financial instruments including asset backed securities and other similar instruments. Financial markets are quite volatile and the markets for these securities can be illiquid. The value of these securities will continue to be impacted by external market factors including default rates, changes in the value of the underlying property, such as residential or commercial real estate, rating agency actions, the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the financial strength of various entities, such as financial guarantors who provide insurance for the securities. Should we need to convert these positions to cash, we may not be able to sell\nthese instruments without significant losses due to current debtor financial conditions or other market considerations.\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d could adversely impact our business.\nAs part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC adopted disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries, as well as procedures regarding a manufacturer's efforts to identify the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals. In March and April 2017, the European Parliament and the European Council formally approved a conflict minerals regulation, and the requirements will become effective starting in January 2021. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, additional costs in order to comply with the SEC\u2019s disclosure requirements. In addition, we might incur further costs due to possible changes to our products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of our due diligence activities. As our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the specified minerals used in our products through our due diligence procedures, which may harm our reputation. In addition, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as \u201cDRC conflict free\u201d, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we do not do so. We filed our report for the calendar year 2016 with the SEC on May 10, 2017.\nRisks related to our common stock\nA significant majority of our voting stock is held by the Schwartz family, which could lead to conflicts of interest.\nWe have two classes of voting stock: Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. With a few exceptions, holders of Class A and Class B Common Stock vote as a single class. When voting as a single class, each share of Class A Common Stock is entitled to one-tenth of a vote, while each share of Class B Common Stock has one vote. In the election or removal of directors, the classes vote separately and the holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to elect 25% of the Board of Directors, with holders of Class B Common Stock electing the remaining directors.\nAs a result of the Schwartz family's ownership of our Class A and Class B Common Stock, they are able to elect a majority of our directors, effect fundamental changes in our direction and control matters affecting us, including the determination of business opportunities that may be suitable for our company. The Schwartz family may exercise its control over us according to interests that are different from other investors\u2019 or debtors\u2019 interests. In particular, this concentration of ownership and voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company.", "PERMNO": 61516, "SIC": 3826, "TIC": "BIO"}
