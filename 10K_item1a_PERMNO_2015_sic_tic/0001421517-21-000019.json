{"cik": "1421517", "company": "Energy Recovery, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nThe following discussion sets forth what management currently believes could be the most significant risks and uncertainties that could impact our businesses, results of operations, and financial condition. Other risks and uncertainties, including those not currently known to us or our management, could also negatively impact our businesses, results of operations, and financial conditions. Accordingly, the following should not be considered a complete discussion of all of the risks and uncertainties we may face. We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time in other reports we file with the SEC.\nRisks Related to our Water Segment\nOur Water segment depends on the construction of new desalination plants, and the retrofit of existing plants, for revenue, and as a result, our operating results have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant variability due to volatility in capital spending, availability of project financing, and other factors affecting the water desalination industry.\nWe currently derive the majority of our revenue from sales of products and services used in desalination plants for municipalities, hotels, mobile containerized desalination solutions, resorts, and agricultural operations in dry or drought-ridden regions of the world. The demand for our Water segment products may decrease if the construction of desalination plants or the retrofit of existing plants, declines for political, economic, or other factors, especially in these dry or drought-ridden regions. In addition, the desalination industry has been experiencing a technology shift from thermal desalination plants to SWRO production. If this technology shift does not continue or we are unable to capture a portion of the market created by this shift, our Water segment sales and revenue can be negatively impacted.\nOther factors that could affect the number and capacity of desalination plants built or the timing of their completion, include the availability of required engineering and design resources; a weak global economy; shortage in the supply of credit and other forms of financing; changes in government regulation, permitting requirements, or priorities; and reduced capital spending for desalination. Each of these factors could result in reduced or uneven demand for our Water segment products. Pronounced variability or delays in the construction of desalination plants or reductions in spending for desalination, could negatively impact our Water segment sales and revenue, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our entire business, financial condition, or results of operations and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast our future sales and revenue.\nOur Water segment faces competition from a number of companies that offer competing energy recovery and pump solutions. If any one of these companies produces superior technology or offers more cost-effective products, our competitive position in the market could be harmed and our profits may decline.\nThe market for ERD and pumps for desalination plants is competitive and evolving. We expect competition, especially competition on price, to persist and intensify as the desalination market grows and new competitors enter the market. Some of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources; longer operating histories; or greater name recognition. They may also have more extensive products and product lines that would enable them to offer multi-product or packaged solutions as well as competing products at lower prices or with other more favorable terms and conditions. As a result, our ability to sustain our market share may be adversely impacted, which would affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, if one of our competitors were to merge or partner with another company, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our continuing ability to compete effectively.\nIf we are unable to collect unbilled receivables, which are caused in part by holdback provisions, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur contracts with large EPC firms generally contain holdback provisions that typically delay final installment payments for our products by up to 24 months, after the product has been shipped and revenue has been recognized. Generally, 10% or less of the revenue we recognize pursuant to our customer contracts is subject to such holdback provisions and is accounted for as contract assets. Such holdbacks may result in relatively high unbilled receivables. If we are unable to collect these performance holdbacks, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Form 10-K 2020 Annual Report | 11\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our components. If our suppliers are not able to meet our demand and/or requirements, our business could be harmed.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers for vessel housings, stainless steel ports, alumina powder, and tungsten carbide for our portfolio of PX ERDs and stainless steel castings and components for our Turbochargers and pumps. Our reliance on a limited number of manufacturers for these supplies involves several risks, including reduced control over delivery schedules, quality assurance, manufacturing yields, production costs, and lack of guaranteed production capacity or product supply. We do not have long-term supply agreements with these suppliers but secure these supplies on a purchase order basis. Our suppliers have no obligation to supply products to us for any specific period, in any specific quantity, or at any specific price, except as set forth in a particular purchase order. Our requirements may represent a small portion of the total production capacities of these suppliers, and our suppliers may reallocate capacity to other customers, even during periods of high demand for our products. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, product quality issues and delivery delays with our suppliers due to factors such as high industry demand or the inability of our vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements. If our suppliers were to cancel or materially change their commitments to us or fail to meet quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, we could lose time-sensitive customer orders, be unable to develop or sell our products cost-effectively or on a timely basis, if at all, and have significantly decreased revenue, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. We may qualify additional suppliers in the future, which would require time and resources. If we do not qualify additional suppliers, we may be exposed to increased risk of capacity shortages due to our dependence on current suppliers.\nA sustained downturn in the economy or prolonged lower oil prices, could impact future desalination plants and the retrofit of existing plants, which could result in decreased demand for our water products and services.\nThe demand for our water products and services depends primarily on the continued construction of new large scale desalination plants and the retrofit of existing plants, particularly in the countries that make up the Gulf Cooperation Council (\u201cGCC\u201d). The recent economic decline caused by the spread of COVID-19 or a prolonged decrease in oil prices, may have a negative economic impact on these and other countries, which may impact the availability of project financing for new desalination and retrofit projects, such as the ability to secure credit for these projects, which would result in the postponement or cancellation, and/or change government priorities or otherwise reduce spending for desalination projects, each of which could result in decreased demand for our water products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our entire business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to product defects, which could lead to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provision or result in a significant or a large number of warranty or other claims in any given year.\nWe provide a warranty for certain products for a period of 18 to 30 months and provide up to a five-year warranty for the ceramic components of our PX-branded products. We test our products in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means; however, there can be no assurance that our testing will reveal latent defects in our products, which may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market. The testing may not replicate the harsh, corrosive, and varied conditions of the desalination and other plants in which they are installed. It is also possible that components purchased from our suppliers could break down under those conditions. Certain components of our Turbochargers and pumps are custom-made and may not scale or perform as required in production environments. Accordingly, there is a risk that we may have significant warranty claims or breach supply agreements due to product defects. We may incur additional cost of revenue if our warranty provisions are not sufficient to cover the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products. If these additional expenses are significant, they could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Form 10-K 2020 Annual Report | 12\nRisks Related to our Emerging Technologies\nThe VorTeq License Agreement with Schlumberger Technology Corporation (\u201cSchlumberger\u201d) was mutually terminated, effective June 1, 2020. We will continue the development of the VorTeq technology without the collaboration of Schlumberger and we may not be able to successfully develop and subsequently commercialize the VorTeq technology.\nIn October 2015, we entered into the VorTeq License Agreement with Schlumberger, which provided Schlumberger with exclusive worldwide rights to our VorTeq technology for hydraulic fracturing onshore applications. In performing the obligations under the license, we provided research and development services to commercialize the technology in accordance with the Key Performance Indicators (\u201cKPIs\u201d), as defined in the VorTeq License Agreement. In order to commercialize the VorTeq technology, the VorTeq License Agreement provided, among other things, that we successfully meet certain specified milestones against key performance indicators set forth in the VorTeq License Agreement. We received a non-refundable up-front $75.0 million exclusivity fee in connection with the VorTeq License Agreement, and the agreement provided for two additional milestone payments of $25.0 million each if the KPIs related to those two milestones would have been achieved. Effective June 1, 2020, we entered into an agreement to terminate the VorTeq License Agreement. As a result, we will pursue the development and commercialization of the VorTeq technology without the collaboration of Schlumberger, and we will not receive the two additional $25.0 million milestone payments that were contemplated by the VorTeq License Agreement. However, there is no exclusivity with respect to the VorTeq technology, and we will be able to pursue the entire hydraulic fracturing market if we successfully commercialize it.\nThe VorTeq technology is a relatively new technology and the hydraulic fracturing process is extremely complex, which presents a wide range of technological challenges for us. If we are unable to successfully solve these challenges or find suitable collaboration partners, we may not be able to successfully commercialize the VorTeq technology, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operation. The successful commercialization of the VorTeq depends heavily on the support of fracking operators and ultimate adoption of the technology by these companies. If the hydraulic fracturing operators fail to adopt the VorTeq technology, for any reason, we may not be able to successfully commercialize the VorTeq technology and we may not receive any return on our significant research and development investment. Failure to commercialize the VorTeq technology could have an adverse effect on our entire business, financial condition, or results of operation.\nWe may be impacted by prolonged deflation in global oil prices which may cause delays or cancellations of projects by oil & gas customers, negatively affecting the rate of our market penetration and consequently our revenue and profitability.\nA deflationary oil and gas environment, as a result of decreased demand or lower oil prices, may delay and even stall adoption and deployment of our products for customers within the oil & gas industry, including but not limited to the VorTeq and IsoBoost. Emerging market economies, those dependent on commodity exports, and especially those for whom oil exports make up a significant percent of total exports, may be unable to retrofit or expand their oil exploration, production, and gas processing infrastructure, thus negatively impacting our addressable market and future revenue. Additionally, oil price deflation may continue to lead to widespread liquidity and insolvency issues for exploration, production, and processing customers, which may negatively affect our addressable markets and therefore our financial performance.\nOur diversification into new fluid flow markets, such as oil & gas, and industrial wastewater, may not be successful.\nWe have made a substantial investment in research, development, and sales to execute on our diversification strategy into fluid flow markets such as oil & gas and industrial wastewater. While we see diversification as core to our growth strategy, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts. Our model for growth is based in part on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, both in terms of geographies and product areas, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services that we develop and market. Any inability to execute this model for growth could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operation results. For example, while we believe that our products will enable gas processing plant operators to operate at a high level of energy efficiency with minimal downtime, we may be subject to warranty claims if customers of these offerings experience significant downtimes or failures for which our warranty reserves may be inadequate given the lack of historical failure rates associated with new product introductions. We also could be subject to damage claims based on our products, which we may not be able to properly insure. In addition, profitability, if any, in new industrial verticals may be lower than in our Water segment, and we may not be sufficiently successful in our diversification efforts to recoup investments.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Form 10-K 2020 Annual Report | 13\nRisks Related to our General Business\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, making our future operating results difficult to predict and causing our operating results to fall below expectations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. We have experienced significant fluctuations in revenue from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, and we expect such fluctuations to continue. In addition, in the past, customer buying patterns led to a significant portion of our sales occurring in the fourth quarter. This presents the risk that delays, cancellations, or other adverse events in the fourth quarter could have a substantial negative impact on annual results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Since it is difficult for us to anticipate our future results, in the event our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, our stock price may decline.\nOur sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, our sales are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from quarter to quarter, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate.\nOur sales efforts involve substantial education of our current and prospective customers about the use and benefits of our energy recovery products. This education process can be time-consuming and typically involves a significant product evaluation process which is particularly pronounced when dealing with product introduction into new fluid flow industrial verticals. In our Water segment, the average sales cycle for our OEM customers, which are involved with smaller desalination plants, ranges from one to 12 months. The average Water segment sales cycle for our international EPC firm customers, which are involved with larger desalination plants, range from 16 to 36 months, or more. These long sales cycles make quarter-by-quarter revenue predictions difficult and results in our expending significant resources well in advance of orders for our products.\nOur business entails significant costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term while demand for our products is variable and subject to fluctuation, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur business requires investments in facilities, equipment, research and development, and training that are either fixed or difficult to reduce or scale in the short term. At the same time, the market for our products is variable and has experienced downturns due to factors such as economic recessions, increased precipitation, uncertain global financial markets, and political changes, many of which are outside of our control. During periods of reduced product demand, we may experience higher relative costs and excess manufacturing capacity, resulting in high overhead and lower gross profit margins while causing cash flow and profitability to decline. Similarly, although we believe that our existing manufacturing facilities are capable of meeting current demand and demand for the foreseeable future, the continued success of our business depends on our ability to expand our manufacturing, research and development, and testing facilities to meet market needs. If we are unable to respond timely to an increase in demand, our revenue, gross profit margin, net income, and cash flow may be adversely affected.\nParts of our inventory may become excess or obsolete, which would increase our cost of revenues.\nInventory of raw materials, parts, components, work in-process, or finished products may accumulate, and we may encounter losses due to a variety of factors, including technological change in the water desalination and oil & gas industries that result in product changes; long delays in shipment of our products or order cancellations; our need to order raw materials that have long lead times and our inability to estimate exact amounts and types of items needed, especially with regard to the configuration of our high-efficiency pumps and IsoBoost system; and cost reduction initiatives resulting in component changes within the products.\nIn addition, we may from time to time purchase more inventory than is immediately required in order to shorten our delivery time in case of an anticipated increase in demand for our products. If we are unable to forecast demand for our products with a reasonable degree of certainty and our actual orders from our customers are lower than these forecasts, we may accumulate excess inventory that we may be required to write off, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Form 10-K 2020 Annual Report | 14\nWe may not generate positive returns on our research and development strategy.\nDeveloping our products is expensive and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our R&D expenses were $23.4 million, or approximately 20% of our total revenue, $23.4 million, or approximately 27% of our total revenue, and $17.0 million, or approximately 23% of our total revenue, respectively. We believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our innovation and our product development efforts. By investing in R&D, we believe we are well positioned to continue to execute on our product strategy, take into consideration our customers\u2019 cost and efficiency sensitivities and take advantage of other market opportunities. We expect that our results of operations may be impacted by the timing and size of these investments. In addition, these investments may take several years to generate positive returns, if ever.\nBusiness interruptions may damage our facilities or those of our suppliers.\nOur operations and those of our suppliers may be vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, flood, and other natural disasters, as well as power loss, telecommunications failure, and other events beyond our control. Our headquarters in California is located near major earthquake faults and has experienced earthquakes in the past. In addition, our facilities in California are located in areas that are subject to public safety power shutdowns (\u201cPSPS\u201d). If a natural disaster occurs or we are subject to PSPS, our ability to conduct our operations could be seriously impaired, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We cannot be sure that the insurance we maintain against general business interruptions will be adequate to cover all of our losses.\nWe are currently involved in legal proceedings, and may be subject to additional future legal proceedings, that may result in material adverse outcomes.\nIn addition to the IP litigation risks discussed above, we are presently involved, and may become involved in the future, in various commercial and other disputes as well as related claims and legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the course of our business. See Note 8, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies - Litigation,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about certain legal proceedings in which we are involved. Our current legal proceedings and any future lawsuits to which we may become a party are, and will likely be, expensive and time consuming to investigate, defend and resolve, and will divert our management\u2019s attention. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nWe release guidance in our quarterly earnings conference calls, quarterly earnings releases, or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our management\u2019s estimates as of the date of release. This guidance, which includes forward-looking statements, will be based on projections prepared by our management. These projections will not be prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our registered public accountant nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections. Accordingly, no such person will express any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the projections.\nProjections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We will continue to state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to imply that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such third parties.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Form 10-K 2020 Annual Report | 15\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance and the differences may be adverse and material.\nIn preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements, which, if not accurate, may significantly impact our financial results.\nWe make assumptions, judgments and estimates for a number of items, including the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill, long-lived assets and other intangible assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets, the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards. We also make assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee-related liabilities, including commissions and variable compensation, and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, allowances for doubtful accounts, and legal contingencies. These assumptions, judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates, and such differences could significantly impact our financial results.\nOur global operations expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally, and our results of operations may be adversely affected by our efforts to comply with the laws of other countries, as well as U.S. laws which apply to international operations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and U.S. export control laws.\nWe operate on a global basis with offices or activities in Europe, Africa, Asia, South America and North America. We face risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations include tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, export control laws, and laws which prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers, including the U.S. FCPA or other anti-corruption laws that have recently been the subject of a substantial increase in global enforcement. Many of our products are subject to U.S. export law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold, or require an export license in connection with sales outside the U.S. Given the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently or intentionally breached, for example, through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements, or otherwise. Also, we may be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions or conditions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions or conditions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our business, and our operating results. In addition, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced significant governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business, licenses, or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or through other methods that relevant law and regulations prohibit us from using. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. These factors or any combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue or our overall financial performance.\nUncertainty in the global geopolitical landscape may impact our operations outside the U.S.\nThere is uncertainty as to the position the U.S. will take with respect to world affairs. This uncertainty may include such issues as U.S. support for existing treaty and trade relationships with other countries, including, notably, China. This uncertainty, together with other recent key global events, such as recently enacted currency control regulations and tariff regimes in or against China, ongoing terrorist activity, and potential hostilities in the Middle East, may adversely impact (i) the ability or willingness of non-U.S. companies to transact business in the U.S., including with us; (ii) our ability to transact business in other countries, including the Middle East, where many of the water megaprojects are planned; (iii) regulation and trade agreements affecting U.S. companies; (iv) global stock markets (including The Nasdaq Global Market on which our common shares are traded); and (v) general global economic conditions. All of these factors are outside of our control, but may nonetheless cause us to adjust our strategy in order to compete effectively in global markets.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Form 10-K 2020 Annual Report | 16\nActs of War or Terrorism.\nThreats or acts of war or terrorism can adversely affect our business. Terrorist attacks in the U.S., Europe and in other countries, and continuing hostilities in the Middle East and elsewhere have created significant instability and uncertainty in the world. These and future events may have a material adverse effect on world financial markets as well as the water industry, as many large existing and planned water desalination plants are located in the Middle East. In addition, threats or acts of war or terrorism can cause our customers to curtail their purchase of our products. These factors or any combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue or our overall financial performance.\nChanges in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our financial obligations and instruments, including our Loan and Pledge Agreement with Citibank N.A., dated January 27, 2017, are, or may be, made at variable interest rates that use LIBOR (or metrics derived from or related to LIBOR) as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or to disappear entirely. These reforms may also result in new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established, or alternative reference rates to be established. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate, or SOFR, which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR, and central banks in several other jurisdictions have also announced plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies. The potential consequences of these actions cannot be fully predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us. Changes in market interest rates may influence our financing costs, and the returns on financial investments and could reduce our earnings and cash flows. In addition, any transition process may involve, among other things, increased volatility or illiquidity in markets for instruments that rely on LIBOR, reductions in the value of certain instruments or the effectiveness of related transactions such as hedges, increased borrowing costs, uncertainty under applicable documentation, or difficult and costly consent processes. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.\nIf we need additional capital to fund future growth, it may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.\nOur primary source of cash historically has been customer payments for our products and services and proceeds from the issuance of common stock. This has funded our operations and capital expenditures. We may require additional capital from equity or debt financing in the future to fund our operations or respond to competitive pressures or strategic opportunities, such as a potential acquisition or the expansion of operations. We may not be able to secure such additional financing on favorable terms or at all. The terms of additional financing may place limits on our financial and operational flexibility. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities, or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new securities that we issue could have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of existing or future holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain necessary financing on terms satisfactory to us, if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges or opportunities could be significantly limited.\nWe may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses, technologies, and assets. These acquisition activities may be unsuccessful or divert management\u2019s attention.\nWe may consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other businesses, technologies, and assets, and such acquisitions or investments are subject to risks that could affect our business, including risks related to:\n\u2022the necessity of coordinating geographically disparate organizations;\n\u2022implementing common systems and controls;\n\u2022integrating personnel with diverse business and cultural backgrounds;\n\u2022integrating acquired research and manufacturing facilities, technology and products;\n\u2022combining different corporate cultures and legal systems;\n\u2022unanticipated expenses related to integration, including technical and operational integration;\n\u2022increased costs and unanticipated liabilities, including with respect to registration, environmental, health and safety matters, that may affect sales and operating results;\n\u2022retaining key employees;\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Form 10-K 2020 Annual Report | 17\n\u2022obtaining required government and third-party approvals;\n\u2022legal limitations in new jurisdictions;\n\u2022installing effective internal controls and audit procedures;\n\u2022issuing common stock that could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders;\n\u2022spending cash and incurring debt;\n\u2022assuming contingent liabilities; and\n\u2022creating additional expenses.\nWe may not be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions or investments. Similarly, we may not be able to obtain financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms. If we do complete acquisitions, we cannot ensure that they will ultimately strengthen our competitive or financial position or that they will not be viewed negatively by customers, financial markets, investors, or the media. In addition, the success of any acquisitions or investments also will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations.\nThe integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex, time-consuming, and expensive process and we may not realize the anticipated revenues or other benefits associated with our acquisitions if we fail to successfully manage and operate the acquired business. If we fail in any acquisition integration efforts and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems, operating procedures, financial controls, and human resources practices, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn connection with certain acquisitions, we may agree to issue common stock or assume equity awards that dilute the ownership of our current stockholders, use a substantial portion of our cash resources, assume liabilities, record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, and incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses, all of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nWe have global operations and face risks related to health epidemics, including the COVID-19 global pandemic, that could materially impact our results of operations.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Any new outbreak of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. These could include disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel or to distribute our products, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers or customers. Any disruption of our suppliers or customers would likely impact our sales and operating results. In addition, a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could impact our operating results.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Form 10-K 2020 Annual Report | 18\nOur business may be further impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic.\nDuring 2020, COVID-19 spread throughout the world, resulting in widespread travel restrictions and extended shutdowns, occupancy limits or other restrictions of non-essential businesses, including manufacturing. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is uncertain at this time and will depend on future developments, including the availability, efficacy and distribution of various vaccines, but further prolonged closures or restrictions throughout the world or the further rollback of reopening measures due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases and continued decreases in the general level of economic activity may further disrupt our operations and the operations of our suppliers and customers. If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively due to illness, quarantines, government actions or orders, facility closures or other reasons in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations will likely be impacted. We may be unable to manufacture sufficient products to perform fully on our contracts and some of our costs may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance. The severity and longevity of the COVID-19 pandemic may also cause customers to suspend their decisions on using our products and/or services, and give rise to significant changes in regional and global economic conditions that could interfere with the planning and construction of large desalination plants, which we rely on. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and may further affect our supply base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy, which could impact our ability to fulfill orders on time or at anticipated cost. Additionally, it is unclear what longer term effects the virus will have on the global economy. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Information Technology\nWe may have risks associated with security of our information technology systems.\nWe make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information technology systems and data. Despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such systems, it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. For example, on October 2, 2020, we detected a cyberattack on our network that temporarily disrupted access to some systems. In accordance with our ESG enterprise risk management policies related to financial and cybersecurity risks, we immediately took steps to isolate affected systems and contain the disruption to our information technology infrastructure. We implemented measures to prevent additional systems from being affected, including taking systems off-line as a precaution. We engaged third party information technology experts to restore and recover those affected systems to full functionality as quickly as possible. We believe there has been no material impact to our operating activities or controls over financial reporting nor have we found any evidence to indicate that any data was compromised or stolen from the affected systems. We do not believe that this incident will have a long-term material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Although we have sufficient controls in place, we have implemented additional enhanced security features and monitoring procedures.\nThere is a risk of industrial espionage, cyberattacks, misuse or theft of information or assets, or damage to assets by people who may gain unauthorized access to our facilities, systems, or information. Such cybersecurity breaches, misuse, or other disruptions could lead to the disclosure of confidential information, improper usage and distribution of our IP, theft, manipulation and destruction of private and proprietary data, and production downtimes. Although we actively employ measures to prevent unauthorized access to our information systems, preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our rights is inherently difficult. These events could adversely affect our financial results and any legal action in connection with any such cybersecurity breach could be costly and time-consuming and may divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of us and our products. In addition, we must frequently expand our internal information system to meet increasing demand in storage, computing and communication, which may result in increased costs. Our internal information system is expensive to expand and must be highly secure due to the sensitive nature of our customers\u2019 information that we transmit. Building and managing the support necessary for our growth places significant demands on our management and resources. These demands may divert these resources from the continued growth of our business and implementation of our business strategy.\nOur actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA wide variety of provincial, state, national, foreign, and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data. These privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations are evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations. Further, our legal and regulatory obligations in foreign jurisdictions are subject to unexpected changes, including the potential for regulatory or other governmental entities to enact new or additional laws or regulations, to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations, or to increase penalties significantly. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can delay or impede the development and offering of new products and services.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Form 10-K 2020 Annual Report | 19\nFor example, the General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018, imposes more stringent data protection requirements, and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance, than the European Union laws that previously applied. Additionally, California recently enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which became effective January 1, 2020. We may also be subject to additional obligations relating to personal data by contract that industry standards apply to our practices. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or other processing, could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, fines, damage to our reputation, and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business. Further, evolving and changing definitions of personal data and personal information, including the classification of internet protocol addresses, machine identification information, location data, and other information, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting business relationships and partnerships that may involve the sharing or uses of data, and may require significant costs, resources, and efforts in order to comply.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our technology or enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed, and we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nOur competitive position depends on our ability to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and to protect our technology from copying by others. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright, and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which may offer only limited protection. We hold a number of U.S. and counterpart international patents, and when their terms expire, we could become more vulnerable to increased competition. The protection of our IP in some countries may be limited. While we have expanded our portfolio of patent applications, we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims, and even if patents are issued, they may be contested, circumvented, or invalidated. Moreover, while we believe our issued patents and patent pending applications are essential to the protection of our technology, the rights granted under any of our issued patents or patents that may be issued in the future may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and as with any technology, competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies now or in the future. In addition, our granted patents may not prevent misappropriation of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where IP laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as those in the U.S. This may render our patents impaired or useless and ultimately expose us to currently unanticipated competition. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our products, trademarks, and other proprietary rights is expensive, difficult, and in some cases, impossible. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our IP rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. IP litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could harm our business.\nClaims by others that we infringe their proprietary rights could harm our business.\nThird parties could claim that our technology infringes their IP rights. In addition, we or our customers may be contacted by third parties suggesting that we obtain a license to certain of their IP rights that they may believe we are infringing. We expect that infringement claims against us may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur. In addition, to the extent that we gain greater visibility, we believe that we will face a higher risk of being the subject of IP infringement claims. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract management from our business. Furthermore, a party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages. A judgment against us could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products. In addition, we might be required to seek a license for the use of such IP, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Any of these events could seriously harm our business. Third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers. Because we generally indemnify our customers if our products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, any such claims would require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on their behalf in one or more jurisdictions, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Form 10-K 2020 Annual Report | 20\nRisks Related to Tax and Governmental Regulations\nWe may have risks associated with our international tax optimization structure.\nIn 2015, we implemented an international tax optimization structure. While we continue to conclude that uncertain tax positions are unlikely, it is possible that the international tax structure could be examined by the Internal Revenue Service in the U.S. and/or the Tax Authorities in Ireland, and it is possible that such an examination could result in an unfavorable impact on us.\nThe enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities, the adoption of other corporate tax reform policies, or changes in tax legislation or policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nOur future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. In addition, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d) made significant changes to the taxation of U.S. business entities that may have a meaningful impact to our provision for income taxes. These changes included a reduction to the federal corporate income tax rate, the current taxation of certain foreign earnings, the imposition of base-erosion prevention measures which may limit the deduction of certain transfer pricing payments, and possible limitations on the deductibility of net interest expense or corporate debt obligations. Accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act required significant judgments and estimates that are based on current interpretations of the Tax Act. The U.S. Department of the Treasury continues to issue regulations that affect various components of the Tax Act. Our future effective tax rate may be impacted by changes in interpretation of the regulations, as well as additional legislation and guidance regarding the Tax Act.\nIn addition, many countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation\u2019s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer-pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. As a result of the heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities, and legislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings. Any such changes in policies or rulings may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change.\nDue to the scale of our international business activities any substantial changes in international corporate tax policies, enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially and adversely affect our business, the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our financial condition and results of operations generally.\nNew or revised tax regulations could have a material effect on our financial statements\nNew tax laws or regulations could be enacted at any time, and existing tax laws or regulations could be interpreted, amended, or applied in a manner that has a material effect on us, which could materially impact our business and financial condition. For example, on March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) was enacted in response to the macroeconomic environment conditions posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act is a sweeping stimulus bill intended to bolster the U.S. economy, among other things, and provide emergency assistance to qualifying businesses and individuals. Based on available guidance, we anticipate that the legislative changes will have a negligible effect on our earnings and cash flow. As the enacted legislation includes provisions that would expire after certain periods of time, the fact that our business has the potential to change its operating situation, and the existence of potential changes by state tax authorities related to conformity with federal tax regulations, the possibility exists that the future benefit of the legislation could change. In addition, it is uncertain if, and to what extent, various states will conform to the CARES Act, or any newly enacted or revised federal tax legislation. For more information related to the CARES Act, see Note 9, \u201cIncome Taxes,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe U.S. Congress may make substantial changes to fiscal, regulation and other federal policies that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nChanges in general economic conditions in the U.S. or other regions could adversely affect our business. There have been and may be significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and government policy. While it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur, changes at the local, state or federal level could impact our business. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals that could have a material impact on us include, but are not limited to, modifications to international trade policy; public company reporting requirements; and environmental regulation.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Form 10-K 2020 Annual Report | 21\nBeginning in 2018, the U.S. imposed additional duties, ranging from 10% to 25%, on a variety of goods imported from China. Effective in September 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (\u201cUSTR\u201d) imposed tariffs of 10% on approximately $200 billion worth of goods imported from China (\u201cList 3 products\u201d), including categories of products we import from China and increased these tariffs to 25% effective in May 2019. In August 2019, the U.S. administration directed the USTR to increase tariffs on List 3 products from 25% to 30%, effective October 2019, which were subsequently delayed indefinitely. China responded to the multiple U.S. tariff lists by announcing several lists of products from the U.S. that are subject to additional tariffs upon import to China. The first round of Chinese retaliatory tariffs went into effect on July 6, 2018, and a second set was implemented on August 23, 2018. Our products are not impacted by these tariffs. A third group of items subject to 5% to 10% tariff went into effect on September 24, 2018, which includes our PX, Turbocharger and pump products.\nWe cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the U.S. and other countries, what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by the other countries in retaliation. Accordingly, it is difficult to predict how such actions may impact our business, or the business of our customers. Our business operations, as well as the businesses of our customers on which we are substantially dependent, are located in various countries at risk for escalating trade disputes, including the U.S. and China. Any resulting trade wars could have a significant adverse effect on world trade and could adversely impact our revenues, gross margins and business operations.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.\nThe SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo (also referred to as the \u201cDRC\u201d) and adjoining countries in their products. Based on our purchasing policy and supplier selection, it is considered unlikely that any conflict minerals are used in the manufacturing of our products. Nevertheless, we are continuing reasonable country of origin inquiry and have implemented a program of due diligence on the source and chain of custody for conflict minerals. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including loss of customers and potential changes to products, processes, or sources of supply. The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary materials from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict-free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we have implemented.\nRisks Related to our Internal Control\nChanges in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) could adversely affect our financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. The FASB periodically issues new accounting standards on a variety of topics. For information regarding new accounting standards, please refer to Note 1, \u201cDescription of Business and Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These and other such standards generally result in different accounting principles, which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in variability of our financial results.\nWe are required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and publicly disclose material weaknesses in our controls. Any adverse results from such evaluation may adversely affect investor perception, and our stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and to disclose in our filing if such controls were unable to provide assurance that a material error would be prevented or detected in a timely manner. We have an ongoing program to review the design of our internal controls framework in keeping with changes in business needs, implement necessary changes to our controls design and test the system and process controls necessary to comply with these requirements. If in the future, our internal controls over financial reporting are determined to be not effective resulting in a material weakness or significant deficiency, investor perceptions regarding the reliability of our financial statements may be adversely affected which could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Form 10-K 2020 Annual Report | 22\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nInsiders and principal stockholders will likely have significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval.\nOur directors, executive officers, and other principal stockholders beneficially own, in the aggregate, a substantial amount of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders could likely have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or our company\u2019s assets.\nThe market price of our common stock may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile and subject to fluctuations. Changes in the stock market generally, as it concerns our industry, as well as geopolitical, economic, and business factors unrelated to us, may also affect our stock price. Significant declines in the market price of our common stock or failure of the market price to increase could harm our ability to recruit and retain key employees, reduce our access to debt or equity capital, and otherwise harm our business or financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to use our common stock effectively as consideration in connection with any future acquisitions.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022authorize our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\u2022require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our Board of Directors, the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, or the president;\n\u2022establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our Board of Directors;\n\u2022establish that our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II, and Class III, with each class serving staggered terms;\n\u2022provide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u2022provide that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u2022specify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors; and\n\u2022require a super-majority of votes to amend certain of the above-mentioned provisions.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law regulating corporate takeovers. Section 203 generally prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder subject to certain exceptions.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Form 10-K 2020 Annual Report | 23\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities.\nIn recent years, shareholder activists have become involved in numerous public companies. Shareholder activists frequently propose to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction and operations of the company. Such proposals may disrupt our business and divert the attention of our Board of Directors, management and employees, and any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan, be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, all of which could adversely affect our business. A proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting could also require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses. In addition, actions of activist shareholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nOur share repurchase program may not be the most effective use of our capital and, if shares are repurchased under the program, could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock.\nPeriodically, our Board of Directors approves programs to repurchase our common stock. Considered in this decision is the effect any such repurchases may have on our cash balances and needs, cash flow, and short and long-term borrowing. Share repurchases under the program may be made from time to time at the Board of Director\u2019s discretion through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The share repurchase program is subject to a periodic review by the Board of Directors and may be suspended periodically or discontinued at any time. We plan to fund repurchases from our existing cash balance. There can be no assurance that we will buy shares of our common stock under the share repurchase program or that any repurchases will have a positive impact on our stock price or earnings per share. We could discontinue or decrease our share repurchases due to unfavorable market conditions, the market price of our common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities presented to us from time to time that would require significant cash outlays, and the availability of funds necessary to continue purchasing shares.\nOur shareholders may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings.\nIn the future, we may offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock in order to raise additional capital. We cannot assure our shareholders that we will be able to sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share our shareholders paid for our shares. Investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our shareholders and our shareholders may experience dilution. Our shareholders may incur additional dilution upon the exercise of any outstanding stock options or warrants, the issuance of shares of restricted stock, the vesting of restricted stock units, or the issuance, vesting or exercise of other equity awards.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, consequently, our shareholders\u2019 ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on the appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and we do not intend at this time to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently expect to utilize any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. In addition, the terms of our revolving credit facility restrict our ability to pay dividends and any future credit facilities, loan agreements, debt instruments or other agreements may further restrict our ability to pay dividends. Payments of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including our business, results of operations and financial condition, current and anticipated cash needs, plans for expansion and any legal or contractual limitations on our ability to pay dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our shareholders\u2019 sole source of potential gain for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 92753, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "ERII"}
