{"cik": "912766", "company": "LAUREATE EDUCATION, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisk Factors\nIn addition to the information set forth in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC, you should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The risks identified below are not all encompassing but should be considered in establishing an opinion of our future operations. Furthermore, the impact of COVID-19 also may exacerbate the risks identified below, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The situation continues to evolve, and additional impacts may arise of which we are not currently aware.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe operate a portfolio of degree-granting higher education institutions in Mexico and Peru and are subject to complex business, economic, legal, political, tax and foreign currency risks, which risks may be difficult to adequately address.\nOur portfolio, which is composed of five institutions, operates in Mexico and Peru, each of which is subject to complex business, economic, legal, political, tax and foreign currency risks. We may have difficulty managing and administering our operations in multiple countries, and we may need to expend additional funds to, among other things, staff key management positions, obtain additional information technology infrastructure and successfully implement relevant course and program offerings for each market, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditional challenges associated with the conduct of our business overseas that may materially adversely affect our operating results include:\n\u2022difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, legal and other differences;\n\u2022our presence solely in Latin America presents risks relating to regional economic pressures;\n\u2022each of our institutions is subject to unique business risks and challenges, including competitive pressures and diverse pricing environments at the local level;\n\u2022difficulty maintaining quality standards consistent with our brands and with local accreditation requirements;\n\u2022potential economic and political instability in the countries in which we operate, including student unrest;\n\u2022fluctuations in exchange rates, possible currency devaluations, inflation and hyperinflation;\n\u2022difficulty selecting, monitoring and controlling partners outside of the United States;\n\u2022compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022expropriation of assets by governments;\n\u2022difficulty protecting our intellectual property rights overseas due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty of laws and enforcement in certain countries relating to the protection of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022lower levels of availability or use of the Internet, through which our online programs are delivered;\n\u2022limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions; and\n\u2022acts of terrorism, public health risks, crime and natural disasters, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations.\nOur success in operating our business will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks related to operating in multiple countries. Any failure by us to effectively manage the challenges associated with our operations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we cannot maintain student enrollments in our institutions and maintain tuition levels, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur strategy for growth and profitability depends, in part, upon maintaining and, subsequently, increasing student enrollments in our institutions and maintaining tuition levels. Attrition rates are often due to factors outside our control. Students sometimes face financial, personal or family constraints that require them to drop out of school. They also are affected by economic and social factors prevalent in their countries. In some markets in which we operate, transfers between universities are not common and, as a result, we are less likely to fill spaces of students who drop out. In addition, our ability to attract and retain students may require us to discount tuition from published levels and may prevent us from increasing tuition levels at a rate consistent with inflation and increases in our costs. If we are unable to control the rate of student attrition, our overall enrollment levels are likely to decline, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to charge tuition rates that are both competitive and cover our rising expenses, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, student enrollment may be negatively affected by our reputation and any negative publicity related to us.\nAn epidemic, pandemic or other public health emergency, such as the current global coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and the efficacy and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the locations in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Company cannot predict the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the efficacy and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, the severity of the illness or the scope, breadth or depth of the actions that may be taken by governmental authorities and/or other third parties in response to the outbreak.\nWe believe that the continued spread of COVID-19 and any resulting preventative or protective actions has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our operations. Our ability to retain students, enroll new students and maintain tuition levels, as well as the ability of our students to pay tuition and other fees, may be materially adversely affected by, among other things, (i) the health of our students, our faculty and their families; (ii) decreases in our students\u2019 and/or their families\u2019 level of disposable income; (iii) the performance and reliability of our online program infrastructure; (iv) our ability to safely return to campus, when appropriate to do so, (v) the efficacy and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines; (vi) the ability of our recruiters to conduct outreach with prospective students during the student recruitment season; and (vii) adverse legislative and regulatory actions. If we are unable to retain students, enroll new students, maintain tuition levels and collect student accounts receivables, we may be required to record impairments and our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, an epidemic, pandemic or other public health emergency could adversely affect, and, in the case of COVID-19, has adversely affected, global economies and financial markets. The depth and duration of the global economic and market turmoil resulting from COVID-19 remain highly uncertain, particularly given the lack of appropriate historical benchmarks. Reduced economic activity, increased unemployment and, in some countries, economic recession, may reduce the demand for our programs among students, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. These adverse economic developments also may result in a reduction in the number of jobs available to our graduates and lower salaries being offered in connection with available employment, which, in turn, may result in declines in our placement and retention rates. As a result, any general economic slowdown or recession that disproportionately impacts the countries in which our institutions operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In the event of a sustained market deterioration, we may need additional liquidity, which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate actions. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in severe disruption and volatility in the U.S. financial markets. The trading price of our stock declined dramatically at the start of the pandemic in 2020 and may continue to experience volatility and declines.\nOur success depends substantially on the value of the local brands of each of our institutions, each of which may be materially adversely affected by changes in current and prospective students\u2019 perception of our reputation and the use of social media.\nEach of our institutions has worked hard to establish the value of its individual brand. Brand value may be severely damaged, even by isolated incidents, particularly if the incidents receive considerable negative publicity. There has been a marked increase in use of social media platforms, including weblogs (blogs), social media websites, and other forms of Internet-based communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience of interested persons. We believe that students and prospective employers value readily available information about our institutions and often act on such information without further investigation or authentication, and without regard to its accuracy. In addition, some of our institutions use the Laureate name in promoting their institutions. Social media platforms and devices immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on the accuracy of the content posted. Information concerning our company\nand our institutions may be posted on such platforms and devices at any time. Information posted may be materially adverse to our interests, it may be inaccurate, and it may harm our performance, prospects and business.\nOur reputation may be negatively influenced by the actions of other for-profit and private institutions.\nAllegations against the post-secondary for-profit and private education sectors may affect general public perceptions of for-profit and private educational institutions, including our institutions and us, in a negative manner. Adverse media coverage regarding other for-profit or private educational institutions or regarding us directly or indirectly could damage our reputation, reduce student demand for our programs, materially adversely affect our revenues and operating profit or result in increased regulatory scrutiny.\nGrowing our online academic programs could be difficult for us.\nDespite our success in effectively transitioning all of our students to an online learning environment shortly after COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, the expansion of our existing online programs and the creation of new online academic programs may not be accepted by students or employers, or by government regulators or accreditation agencies, once we reach an epidemiological end to the pandemic. In addition, our efforts may be materially adversely affected by increased competition in the online education market or because of problems with the performance or reliability of our online program infrastructure.\nOur success depends, in part, on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs in recruiting new students.\nIn order to maintain and increase our revenues and margins, we must continue to develop our admissions programs and attract new students in a cost-effective manner. The level of marketing and advertising and types of strategies used are affected by the specific geographic markets, regulatory compliance requirements and the specific individual nature of each institution and its students. The complexity of these marketing efforts contributes to their cost. If we are unable to advertise and market our institutions and programs successfully, our ability to attract and enroll new students could be materially adversely affected and, consequently, our financial performance could suffer. We use marketing tools such as the Internet, radio, television and print media advertising to promote our institutions and programs. Our representatives also make presentations at upper secondary schools. In order to maintain our growth, we will need to attract a larger percentage of students in existing markets and increase our addressable market by adding locations in new markets and rolling out new academic programs. Any failure to accomplish this may have a material adverse effect on our future growth.\nIf we do not effectively manage our growth and business, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to maintain or accelerate the current growth rate, effectively manage expanding operations, build expansion capacity, or achieve planned growth on a timely or profitable basis. If our revenue growth is less than projected, the costs incurred for these additions and upgrades could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur institutions are subject to uncertain and varying laws and regulations, and any changes to these laws or regulations or their application to us may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHigher education is regulated to varying degrees and in different ways in each of the countries in which we operate an institution. In general, our institutions must have licenses, approvals, authorizations, or accreditations from various governmental authorities and accrediting bodies. These licenses, approvals, authorizations, and accreditations must be renewed periodically, usually after an evaluation of the institution by the relevant governmental authorities or accrediting bodies. These periodic evaluations could result in limitations, restrictions, conditions, or withdrawal of such licenses, approvals, authorizations or accreditations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Once licensed, approved, authorized or accredited, some of our institutions may need approvals for new campuses or to add new degree programs.\nAll of these regulations and their applicable interpretations are subject to change. Moreover, regulatory agencies may scrutinize our institutions because they are owned or controlled by a U.S.-based for-profit corporation. Changes in applicable regulations may cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe higher education market is very competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nHigher education markets around the world are highly fragmented and are very competitive and dynamic. Our institutions compete with traditional public and private colleges and universities and other proprietary institutions, including those that offer online professional-oriented programs. In each of the countries in which we operate a private institution, our primary competitors are public and other private universities, some of which are larger, more widely known and have more established reputations than our institutions. Some of our competitors in both the public and private sectors may have greater financial and other resources than we have and have operated in their markets for many years. Other competitors may include large, well-capitalized companies that may pursue a strategy similar to ours of acquiring or establishing for-profit institutions. Public institutions receive substantial government subsidies, and public and private not-for-profit institutions have access to government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions and other financial resources generally not available to for-profit institutions. Accordingly, public and private not-for-profit institutions may have instructional and support resources superior to those in the for-profit sector, and public institutions can offer substantially lower tuition prices or other advantages that we cannot match.\nIf our graduates are unable to obtain professional licenses or certifications required for employment in their chosen fields of study, our reputation may suffer and we may face declining enrollments and revenues or be subject to student litigation.\nCertain of our students require or desire professional licenses or certifications after graduation to obtain employment in their chosen fields. Their success in obtaining such licensure depends on several factors, including the individual merits of the student, whether the institution and the program were approved by the relevant government or by a professional association, whether the program from which the student graduated meets all governmental requirements and whether the institution is accredited. If one or more governmental authorities refuses to recognize our graduates for professional licensure in the future based on factors relating to us or our programs, the potential growth of our programs would be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we could be exposed to litigation that would force us to incur legal and other expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be materially adversely affected if we are not able to maintain or improve the content of our existing academic programs or to develop new programs on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner.\nWe continually seek to maintain and improve the content of our existing academic programs and develop new programs in order to meet changing market needs. Revisions to our existing academic programs and the development of new programs may not be accepted by existing or prospective students or employers in all instances. If we cannot respond effectively to market changes, our business may be materially adversely affected. Even if we are able to develop acceptable new programs, we may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as students or employers require or as quickly as our competitors are able to introduce competing programs. Our efforts to introduce a new academic program may be conditioned or delayed by requirements to obtain foreign, federal, state and accrediting agency approvals. The development of new programs and courses, both conventional and online, is subject to requirements and limitations imposed by the governmental regulatory bodies of the various countries in which our institutions are located. The imposition of restrictions on the initiation of new educational programs by regulatory agencies may delay such expansion plans. If we do not respond adequately to changes in market requirements, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and our financial results could suffer.\nEstablishing new academic programs or modifying existing academic programs also may require us to make investments in specialized personnel and capital expenditures, increase marketing efforts and reallocate resources away from other uses. We may have limited experience with the subject matter of new programs and may need to modify our systems and strategy. If we are unable to increase the number of students, offer new programs in a cost-effective manner or otherwise effectively manage the operations of newly established academic programs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to keep pace with changing market needs and technology could harm our ability to attract students.\nThe success of our institutions depends to a significant extent on the willingness of prospective employers to hire our students upon graduation. Increasingly, employers demand that their employees possess appropriate technological skills and appropriate \u201csoft\u201d skills, such as communication, critical thinking and teamwork skills. These skills can evolve rapidly in a changing economic and technological environment. Accordingly, it is important that our educational programs evolve in response to those economic and technological changes. The expansion of existing academic programs and the development of new programs may not be accepted by current or prospective students or by the employers of our graduates. Students and faculty increasingly rely on personal communication devices and expect that we will be able to adapt our information technology\nplatforms and our educational delivery methods to support these devices and any new technologies that may develop. Even if our institutions are able to develop acceptable new programs and adapt to new technologies, our institutions may not be able to begin offering those new programs and technologies as quickly as required by prospective students and employers or as quickly as our competitors begin offering similar programs. If we are unable to adequately respond to changes in market requirements due to regulatory or financial constraints, unusually rapid technological changes or other factors, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired, the rates at which our graduates obtain jobs involving their fields of study could suffer and our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may have exposure to greater-than-anticipated tax liabilities.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.\nOur future income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions in which we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions in which we have higher statutory tax rates. In addition, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations and accounting principles, could have a material adverse effect on our future income taxes.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We have not recorded deferred tax liabilities for undistributed foreign earnings because our strategy is to reinvest these earnings outside the United States. As circumstances change and if some or all of these undistributed foreign earnings are remitted to the United States, we may be required to recognize deferred tax liabilities on any amounts that we are unable to repatriate in a tax-free manner.\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. We are also subject to non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are under regular audit by tax authorities with respect to these non-income based taxes and may have exposure to additional non-income based tax liabilities.\nWe have identified certain tax-related contingencies that we have assessed as being reasonably possible of loss, but not probable of loss, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations if the outcomes are unfavorable. In most cases, we have received indemnifications from the former owners of the acquired businesses for contingencies. In cases where we are not indemnified, the unrecorded contingencies are not material.\nFor information related to outstanding tax audits initiated by the Spanish Taxing Authorities, see \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nAlthough we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially adversely affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nOur reported revenues and earnings may be negatively affected by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and currency exchange rates.\nWe report revenues, costs and earnings in U.S. dollars, while our institutions generally collect tuition in the local currency. Exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the local currency in the countries where we operate institutions are likely to fluctuate from period to period. In 2021, essentially all of our revenues originated outside the United States. We translate revenues and other results denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars for our consolidated financial statements. This translation is based on average exchange rates during a reporting period. In recent years, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against many international currencies, including the Mexican peso. As the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar strengthens, our reported international revenues and earnings are reduced because foreign currencies translate into fewer U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2021, a hypothetical 10% adverse change in average annual foreign currency exchange rates would have increased our operating loss and decreased our Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $21.9 million and $36.6 million, respectively. For more information, see \u201cItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Foreign Currency Exchange Risk.\u201d\nTo the extent that foreign revenues and expense transactions are not denominated in the local currency and/or to the extent foreign earnings are reinvested in a currency other than their functional currency, we are also subject to the risk of transaction losses. We occasionally enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other hedging arrangements to reduce the earnings\nimpact of non-functional currency denominated non-trade receivables and debt and to protect the U.S. dollar value of our assets and future cash flows with respect to exchange rate fluctuations. Given the volatility of exchange rates, there is no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage currency transaction and/or translation risks. Therefore, volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCurrency exchange rates and our reported revenues and earnings may also be negatively affected by inflation or hyperinflation. If a country in which we operate is designated as a highly inflationary economy in the future under GAAP, the U.S. dollar would become the functional currency for our operations in that country. As a result, all gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of the financial results of operations in such country and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses would be reflected in our earnings, which could result in volatility within our earnings, rather than as a component of our comprehensive income within stockholders\u2019 equity. Hyperinflation in any of the countries in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles make up a significant portion of our total assets, and if we determine that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles become impaired in the future, net income and operating income in such years may be materially and adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $690 million. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Due to the revaluation of our assets at the time of the leveraged buyout transaction (LBO) and acquisitions we have completed historically, goodwill makes up a significant portion of our total assets. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the results of operations. Future reviews of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles could result in reductions. Any reduction in net income and operating income resulting from the write down or impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles could adversely affect our financial results. If economic or industry conditions deteriorate or if market valuations decline, including with respect to our common stock, we may be required to impair goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles in future periods.\nWe experience seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations.\nThe institutions in our portfolio have a summer break, during which classes are generally not in session and minimal revenues are recognized. In addition to the timing of summer breaks, holidays such as Easter also have an impact on our academic calendar. Operating expenses, however, do not fully correlate to the enrollment and revenue cycles, as the institutions continue to incur expenses during summer breaks. Accordingly, our second and fourth quarters are stronger revenue quarters, as our institutions are in session for most of these respective quarters. Our first and third fiscal quarters are weaker revenue quarters because our institutions have summer breaks for some portion of one of these two quarters. Because a significant portion of our expenses do not vary proportionately with the fluctuations in our revenues, our results in a particular fiscal quarter may not indicate accurately the results we will achieve in a subsequent quarter or for the full fiscal year.\nConnectivity constraints or technology system disruptions to our computer networks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain students.\nWe run the online operations of our institutions on different platforms, which are in various stages of development. The performance and reliability of these online operations are critical to the reputation of our institutions and our ability to attract and retain students. Any computer system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in traffic on our institutions\u2019 computer networks, may result in the unavailability of these computer networks. In addition, any significant failure of our computer networks could disrupt our on-campus operations. Individual, sustained or repeated occurrences could significantly damage the reputation of our institutions\u2019 operations and result in a loss of potential or existing students. Additionally, the computer systems and operations of our institutions are vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters and other catastrophic events and network and telecommunications failures. Like other global companies, our computer systems are regularly subject to and will continue to be the target of computer viruses, malware or other malicious codes (including ransomware), unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other computer-related penetrations. While we have experienced threats to our data and systems, to date, we are not aware that we have experienced a material cyber-security breach. However, over time, the sophistication of these threats continues to increase. The preventative actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information may be insufficient. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions to or malfunctions in operations. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these incidents. Further, the disaster recovery plans and backup systems that we have in place may not be effective in addressing a natural disaster or catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or\ninformation technology and infrastructure systems. As a result of any of these events, we may not be able to conduct normal business operations and may be required to incur significant expenses in order to resume normal business operations. As a result, our revenues and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to privacy and information security laws and regulations due to our collection and use of personal information, and any violations of those laws or regulations, or any breach, theft or loss of that information, could materially adversely affect our reputation and operations.\nPossession and use of personal information in our operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business. Our institutions collect, use and retain large amounts of personal information regarding our students and their families, including social security numbers, tax return information, personal and family financial data and credit card numbers. We also collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business. In addition, we collect and maintain other types of information, such as leads, that may include personal information of our business contacts in the ordinary course of our business. Our computer networks and the networks of certain of our vendors that hold and manage confidential information on our behalf may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, cyber-attacks and other security threats. Confidential information also may become available to third parties inadvertently when we integrate or convert computer networks into our network following an acquisition of an institution or in connection with upgrades from time to time.\nDue to the sensitive nature of the information contained on our networks, such as students\u2019 grades, our networks may be targeted by hackers. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Although we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information, a third party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls, which could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. See above risk factor regarding threats experienced by us and other global companies as continued targets of cyber security attacks and that, despite having experienced threats, we are not aware that we have experienced a material cyber-security breach. The preventative actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information may be insufficient. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate personal or proprietary information. In addition, errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches.\nFurthermore, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. For example, the European Union\u2019s privacy and data security regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), imposes more stringent requirements in how we collect and process personal data and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance. Mexico and Peru have passed or are considering similar privacy regulations, resulting in additional compliance burdens and uncertainty as to how some of these laws will be interpreted. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources to comply with privacy laws and regulations.\nA breach, theft or loss of personal information regarding our students and their families, our employees, or other persons that is held by us or our vendors, or a violation of the laws and regulations governing privacy in one or more of the countries in which we operate, could result in significant penalties or legal liability, reputational damage, and/or remediation and compliance costs, which could be substantial and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStudent protests and strikes may disrupt our ability to hold classes as well as our ability to attract and retain students, which could materially adversely affect our operations.\nPolitical, social and economic developments in the countries in which we operate may cause protests and disturbances against conditions in those countries, including policies relating to the operation and funding of higher education institutions. These disturbances may involve protests on university campuses, including the occupation of university buildings and the disruption of classes. We are unable to predict whether students at our institutions will engage in various forms of protest in the future. Should we sustain student strikes, protests or occupations in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and on our overall financial condition. Further, we may need to make additional investments in security infrastructure and personnel on our campuses in order to prevent future student protests from disrupting the ability of our institutions to hold classes. If we are required to make substantial additional investments in security, or if we are unable to identify security enhancements that would prevent future disruptions of classes, that could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may need to pay overtime compensation to certain of our faculty and staff, which may increase our overall costs.\nWe may be unable to operate one or more of our institutions or suffer liability or loss due to a natural or other disaster, including as a result of the effects of climate change.\nOur institutions are vulnerable to natural or other disasters, including fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes and other events beyond our control. A number of our institutions in Mexico and Peru are located in areas that are prone to damage from major weather events, which may be substantial and may occur with higher frequency or severity or be less predictable in the future due to the effects of climate change. For example, in 2017, Peru\u2019s normally arid regions experienced historic, torrential rainfall and subsequent flooding. At least one of our campuses located there suffered flood-related damage. There, as elsewhere in the country, flood-related damage caused a range of disruptions, including in our case a delay in the regularly scheduled start of classes for the semester, which caused revenue disruptions. In addition, a number of our institutions in Mexico and Peru are located in areas that are prone to earthquake damage. For example, in 2017, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck Mexico, causing a temporary suspension of activities at several UVM and UNITEC campuses that lasted 12 days on average, and we incurred significant direct costs for repairs due to the earthquake. It is possible that one or more of our institutions would be unable to operate for an extended period of time in the event of a hurricane, earthquake or other disaster that causes substantial damage to the area in which an institution is located. The failure of one or more of our institutions to operate for a substantial period of time could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In the event of a major natural or other disaster, we could also experience loss of life of students, faculty members and administrative staff, or liability for damages or injuries.\nWe may be unable to recruit, train and retain qualified and experienced faculty and administrative staff at our institutions.\nOur success and ability to grow depend on the ability to hire and retain large numbers of talented people. The process of hiring employees with the combination of skills and attributes required to implement our business strategy can be difficult and time-consuming. Our faculty members in particular are key to the success of our institutions. We face competition in attracting and retaining faculty members who possess the necessary experience and accreditation to teach at our institutions. It may be difficult to maintain consistency in the quality of our faculty and administrative staff. If we are unable to, or are perceived to be unable to, attract and retain experienced and qualified faculty, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to upgrade our campuses, they may become less attractive to parents and students and we may fail to grow our business.\nAll of our institutions require periodic upgrades to remain attractive to parents and students. Upgrading the facilities at our institutions could be difficult for a number of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022our properties may not have the capacity or configuration to accommodate proposed renovations;\n\u2022construction and other costs may be prohibitive;\n\u2022we may fail to obtain regulatory approvals;\n\u2022it may be difficult and expensive to comply with local building and fire codes;\n\u2022we may be unable to finance construction and other costs; and\n\u2022we may not be able to negotiate reasonable terms with our landlords or developers or complete the work within acceptable timeframes.\nOur failure to upgrade the facilities of our institutions could lead to lower enrollment and could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to attract and retain the key talent needed for us to timely achieve our business objectives, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nThe marketplace for senior executive management candidates is very competitive. Unplanned or repeated turnover within the senior management ranks in the corporate team or in the regions in which we operate can lead to instability or weakness in oversight that creates the conditions for gaps in performance and non-compliance with our control environment or public company reporting requirements. Any one of these occurrences could adversely affect our stock price, results of operations, ability to timely report financial results, or business relationships and can make recruiting for future management positions\nmore difficult. Competition for senior leadership may increase our overall compensation expenses, whether resulting from new hires or retention, which may negatively affect our profitability.\nLitigation may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, students, suppliers, competitors, minority partners, counterparties in transactions in which we purchase or sell assets, stockholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation, some of which may take place in jurisdictions in which local parties may have certain advantages over foreign parties. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, regulatory actions and intellectual property claims, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, or may assert criminal charges, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), as well as trade compliance and economic sanctions laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties, harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDoing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of numerous jurisdictions. These laws and regulations place restrictions on our operations and business practices. In particular, we are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage, along with various other anti-corruption laws. As a result of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign partners, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and other intermediaries comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws to which we are subject, there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the FCPA or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire. We cannot assure you that all of our local partners will comply with these laws, in which case we could be held liable for actions taken inside or outside of the United States, even though our partners may not be subject to these laws. Any development of new partnerships and joint venture relationships worldwide would increase the risk of FCPA violations in the future.\nViolations of anti-corruption laws, export control laws and regulations, and economic sanctions laws and regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. If we fail to comply with the FCPA or other laws governing the conduct of international operations, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws, export control laws and regulations, and economic sanctions laws and regulations by the United States or foreign authorities could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, regardless of the outcome of the investigation.\nWe have in the past had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nIn 2018, we remediated each of the four material weaknesses that were previously identified and were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. See \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures-Remediation of Material Weaknesses\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nHowever, we may in the future discover areas of our internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that need improvement. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, regardless of how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements, and we or our independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to provide us with an unqualified opinion as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If that were to happen, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could lead to a decline in the market price of our common stock and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nAdditionally, the existence of any material weakness could require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weakness and management may not be able to remediate any such material weakness in a timely manner. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting also could result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause the holders of our common stock to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially adversely affect our business and share price.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nOur debt agreements contain, and future debt agreements may contain, restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of October 7, 2019 (as amended from time to time, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), which governs our multi-currency revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d), contains various covenants that may limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022pay dividends and make certain distributions, investments and other restricted payments;\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness, issue disqualified stock or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022sell assets;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022create certain liens or encumbrances;\n\u2022preserve our corporate existence;\n\u2022merge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nWhile the Credit Agreement provides for quarterly compliance with the Consolidated Senior Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, as of December 31, 2021, we were not required to comply with this covenant.\nWe rely on funds from our operating subsidiaries to meet our debt service and other obligations.\nWe conduct all of our operations through certain of our subsidiaries, and we have no significant assets other than cash of approximately $55 million as of December 31, 2021 held at corporate entities and the capital stock or other control rights of our subsidiaries. As a result, we rely on our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make distributions or other payments to their parent companies. In addition, we rely on intercompany loan repayments and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet any existing or future debt service and other obligations, a substantial portion of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make distributions or other payments to their parent companies or directly to us will depend on their respective operating results and may be restricted by, among other things, the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization, regulatory requirements, agreements entered into by those operating subsidiaries and the covenants of any existing or future outstanding indebtedness that we or our subsidiaries may incur. Further, because most of our income is generated by our operating subsidiaries in non-U.S. dollar denominated currencies, our ability to\nservice our U.S. dollar denominated debt obligations may be affected by any strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the functional currencies of our operating subsidiaries.\nDisruptions of the credit and equity markets worldwide may impede or prevent our access to the capital markets for additional funding to conduct our business and may affect the availability or cost of borrowing under our existing credit facility.\nThe credit and equity markets of both mature and developing economies have historically experienced extraordinary volatility, asset erosion and uncertainty, leading to governmental intervention in the banking sector in the United States and abroad. If these market disruptions occur in the future, we may not be able to access the capital markets to obtain funding needed to refinance our existing indebtedness or conduct our business. In addition, changes in the capital or other legal requirements applicable to commercial lenders may affect the availability or increase the cost of borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility. If we are unable to obtain needed capital on terms acceptable to us, we may need to limit our growth initiatives or take other actions that materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Investing in Our Common Stock\nAs a public benefit corporation, our focus on a specific public benefit purpose and producing a positive effect for society may negatively influence our financial performance.\nAs a public benefit corporation, we may take actions that we believe will benefit our students and the surrounding communities, even if those actions do not maximize our short- or medium-term financial results. While we believe that this designation and obligation will benefit the Company given the importance to our long-term success of our commitment to education, it could cause our board of directors to make decisions and take actions not in keeping with the short-term or more narrow interests of our stockholders. Any longer-term benefits may not materialize within the timeframe we expect or at all and may have an immediate negative effect. For example:\n\u2022we may choose to revise our policies in ways that we believe will be beneficial to our students and their communities in the long term, even though the changes may be costly in the short- or medium-term;\n\u2022we may take actions, such as modernizing campuses to provide students with the latest technology, even though these actions may be more costly than other alternatives;\n\u2022in exiting a market that is not meeting our goals, we may choose to \u201cteach out\u201d the existing student body over several years rather than lose an institution; even though this could be substantially more expensive;\n\u2022we may be influenced to pursue programs and services to demonstrate our commitment to our students and communities even though there is no immediate return to our stockholders; or\n\u2022in responding to a possible proposal to acquire the Company and/or any business unit, our board of directors may be influenced by the interests of our employees, students, teachers and others whose interests may be different from the interests of our stockholders.\nWe may be unable or slow to realize the long-term benefits we expect from actions taken to benefit our students and communities in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf we or our existing investors sell or announce an intention to sell additional shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market, or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to raise capital through future sales of equity securities at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate, or at all.\nThe trading price of our common stock is subject to volatility. Additionally, if we do not maintain adequate or favorable coverage of our common stock by securities analysts, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate and is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. Additionally, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade their evaluations of our stock or publish unfavorable commentary about us or our industry, the price of our common stock could decline. We may be unable to maintain adequate research coverage, and if one or more analysts cease coverage of us, we could lose visibility in the market for our common stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nRisks Relating to Peruvian Nonresident Capital Gains Tax\nSale of our common stock may trigger taxes payable in Peru.\nStockholders who sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of Company shares may be subject to Peruvian tax at a rate of 30% on their gain realized in such transaction determined under certain Peruvian valuation rules regardless of whether the transaction is taxable for non-Peruvian purposes. In determining the amount of such gain subject to such tax, the gain is first multiplied by the percentage of the Company\u2019s value that is represented by its Peruvian business determined under certain Peruvian valuation rules (the \u201cPeru Ratio\u201d). This tax applies if the value of stock determined under certain Peruvian valuation rules (calculated in PEN) transferred multiplied by the Peru Ratio exceeds approximately $44 million applying the PEN/USD exchange rate of December 31, 2021 (the \u201cThreshold\u201d). The Threshold is calculated in PEN and changes with currency exchange rates. For purposes of determining whether the Threshold has been exceeded by any holder, all transfers made by such holder over any 12-month period are aggregated. For purposes of determining whether any tax is owed, the holder must have their basis \u201ccertified\u201d by the Peruvian tax authorities in advance of such transaction. If the holder exceeds the Threshold and does not obtain a tax basis certificate before the transaction, the holder\u2019s tax basis in the shares will be considered zero for Peruvian tax purposes. We advise current and future holders, who currently have or intend to own or trade in significant volumes of our common stock, to seek the advice of their own advisors with knowledge of the matters described above.\nDirect or indirect transfer of company common shares may result in Peruvian tax liability to the Company.\nIn the event that a direct or indirect sale, exchange, or other disposition of Company shares occurs and any resulting Peruvian tax is not paid, the Company\u2019s Peruvian subsidiaries may be jointly and severally liable for such tax. Joint and several liability may be imposed if during any of the 12 months preceding the transaction, inter alia, the transferor of Company shares held an indirect or direct interest of more than 10% of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares. If such a transaction were to occur and the Peruvian tax authorities sought to collect the Peruvian capital gains taxes from the Company\u2019s Peruvian subsidiaries that were not paid by such transferor, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 16591, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "LAUR"}
