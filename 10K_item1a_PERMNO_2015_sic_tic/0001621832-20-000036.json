{"cik": "1621832", "company": "Aqua Metals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before purchasing our common stock, you should read and consider carefully the following risk factors as well as all other information contained in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Each of these risk factors, either alone or taken together, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently believe are immaterial, which could also impair our business and financial position. If any of the events described below were to occur, our financial condition, our ability to access capital resources, our results of operations and/or our future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline. As a result, you could lose some or all of any investment you may make in our common stock.\nRisks Relating to the Recent Fire at TRIC\nWe have experienced a fire at our TRIC facility which has caused significant damage and resulted in the suspension of all revenue producing operations. On the evening of November 29, 2019, a fire occurred at our LAB recycling facility at TRIC. The cause of ignition is likely related to on-site contractor work that was being performed on the day of the fire. The fire was substantially contained to the AquaRefining area of the plant, however the fire destroyed or impaired beyond recovery substantially all of the AquaRefining equipment, including all 16 AquaRefining modules, control wiring and other supporting infrastructure. While we continue to assess the economic loss due to the fire, as of the date of this report we estimate that the value of the equipment and plant lost or damaged due to the fire is approximately $37 million excluding any business interruption cost recovery. We maintain insurance policies covering a total of up to $50 million of combined property, equipment and business interruption insurance. As of the date of this report, the insurance carriers have paid a total of $10 million on the covered claims and we expect the carriers to make significant additional payments over the coming months up to the presently estimated value of the equipment and plant lost or damaged due to the fire (approximately $37 million). However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to collect additional insurance proceeds to cover the loss. In the meantime, we have suspended all revenue producing operations pending our clean-up of the fire damage and development of our plan for the overall business. As of the date of this report, we are unable to estimate when we expect to resume any meaningful commercial or revenue producing operations. As of the date of this report, we intend to fund our resumption of commercial operations through our receipt of insurance proceeds, however there can be no assurance that the proceeds will be collected.\nWhile we have $50 million of combined property, equipment and business interruption insurance, there can be no assurance that one or more carriers will not attempt to deny coverage. To date, we have submitted claims to each of our insurance carriers. Each of the insurance carriers have accepted coverage under the polices subject to the customary reservation of rights, but no carrier has to our knowledge indicated that it would deny or attempt to deny coverage. Each of our insurance policies contain customary exclusions from the carriers\u2019 obligation to cover claims made under the policies, including exclusions based on certain of our intentional acts or omissions, including our willful failure to maintain an adequate fire suppression system. We had acquired and installed a comprehensive fire suppression at TRIC, however the preliminary investigation by the local fire marshal indicates that the fire suppression system at TRIC failed to activate at the time of the fire. We had, at all times leading up to the fire, engaged a nationally recognized fire detection and prevention service company to service and maintain our fire suppression system. The service provider had serviced our fire suppression system as recent as November 12, 2019. As of the date of this report, we have not determined the reason for the failure of our fire suppression system to activate at the time of the fire. However, we have no reason to believe that the failure to activate is due to any action or failure to act on our part that would justify a carrier to exclude payment on our insurance claim. However, there can be no assurance that a carrier may not deny coverage based on its claim that we failed to maintain a fire suppression system as required by the policy or for some other exclusion under the policy. In the event that one or more carriers deny coverage under their policies, we may be unable to finance our recovery and resume commercial operations, in which case you could lose your investment.\nOur ability to utilize insurance payments is subject to our credit facility with our secured lender. As of the date of this report, we are indebted to Green Bank for approximately $9.2 million ($8.6 million net of issuance costs), which is secured by liens on substantially all of our assets, including the proceeds of any payments made on our insurance claims. Pursuant to the credit agreement governing such indebtedness, Green Bank is the loss payee on our insured claims and all funds are paid directly to Green Bank, which in turn disburses the proceeds to us based on our submission of a use of funds. To date, Green Bank has disbursed to us funds requested by us, however there can be no assurance that Green Bank will not deny future disbursements. In the event that Green Bank denies future disbursements, we may be required to allocate approximately $10 million of insurance payments towards the repayment of the Green Bank loan, which payment would include a $0.5 million prepayment penalty.\nAs a result of the fire, we are revising our plans for the commercialization of our AquaRefining technologies and there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful. When we designed and developed TRIC, we did so at a time when our\nbusiness model assumed that TRIC would be the first of many LAB recycling facilities owned and operated by us. Commencing in 2017, we began to shift our focus away from the development of additional Company-owned LAB recycling facilities and towards the licensing of our AquaRefining technology to partners engaged in LAB recycling. We continued to develop TRIC as a LAB recycling facility for purposes of demonstrating AquaRefining on a commercial scale. However, as a result of the fire and our high costs of capital we believe that the cost of restoring TRIC to its pre-fire state would not be the best use of our available cash and that we may be able to achieve the benefits of operating 16 AquaRefining modules, namely the demonstration of the scalability of our AquaRefining technologies, through a less costly commercialization program. As of the date of this report, we plan to focus on licensing opportunities within the $20+ billion lead battery recycling marketplace. We believe this path is far less capital intensive than a rebuild of TRIC to its pre-fire state and we believe this plan could be funded solely or primarily from cash on hand plus ongoing insurance proceeds and asset disposition of the AquaRefinery. However, there can be no assurance that our revised business model will be successful or that we will acquire insurance proceeds sufficient to fund our revised business plan.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nSince we have a limited operating history and have only recently commenced revenue producing operations, it is difficult for potential investors to evaluate our business. We formed our corporation in June 2014 and only commenced revenue producing operations in the first quarter of 2017. From inception through December 31, 2019, we generated a total of $11.4 million of revenue, all of which was derived primarily from the sale of lead compounds and plastics and, to a lesser extent, the sale of lead bullion and Aqua Refined lead. To date, our operations have primarily consisted of the development and testing and limited operations of our AquaRefining process, the construction of our initial LAB recycling facility at TRIC, the continuing development of our LAB recycling operations at TRIC and limited revenue producing operations as we brought those LAB recycling operations online. As a result of the November 2019 fire at TRIC, we have suspended all plant based revenue producing operations pending our clean-up of the fire damage and development of our plan for resuming operations. As of the date of this report, we are unable to estimate when we expect to resume any meaningful commercial or revenue producing operations. Our limited operating history makes it difficult for potential investors to evaluate our technology or prospective operations. As an early stage company, we are subject to all the risks inherent in the initial organization, financing, expenditures, complications and delays in a new business, including, without limitation:\n\u2022the timing and success of our plan of commercialization and the fact that we have suspended operations at TRIC;\n\u2022our ability to demonstrate that our AquaRefining technology can be operated on a commercial scale;\n\u2022our ability to profitably operate our AquaRefining process on a commercial scale; and\n\u2022our ability to realize the expected benefits of our strategic partnerships with Clarios and Veolia.\nInvestors should evaluate an investment in us in light of the uncertainties encountered by developing companies in a competitive environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that we will ultimately be able to attain profitability.\nOur business is dependent upon our successful implementation of novel technologies and processes and there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement such technologies and processes in a manner that supports the successful commercial roll-out of our business model. While much of the technology and processes involved in our lead recycling operations are widely used and proven, the AquaRefining component of our lead recycling operations is largely novel with limited modest scale operations. While we have shown that our proprietary technology can produce AquaRefined lead on a small scale, we have just begun to demonstrate that we can produce AquaRefined lead on a commercial scale. Further, as we endeavored to complete our AquaRefining production line, we continuously encountered unforeseen complications that delayed the ramping up of our AquaRefining modules and the integration of our AquaRefining process with the traditional lead recycling operations. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar unforeseen complications as we pursue our revised business model.\nWe will need additional financing to execute our business plan and fund operations, which additional financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. As of December 31, 2019, we had total cash of $7.6 million and working capital of $17.7 million, which includes $17.4 million of insurance proceeds receivable, of which we had received $7.5 million of insurance proceeds following year-end. As of the date of this report, we believe that we may require additional capital in order to fund our current level of ongoing costs and our proposed business plan over the next 12 months as we move forward with our capital light licensing strategy. We intend to acquire the necessary capital though the recovery of insurance proceeds on our fire related claims and the possible sale of certain equipment and assets at TRIC. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to collect insurance proceeds or acquire proceeds from the sale of TRIC in amounts sufficient to fund the capital requirements or, if we are successful, that we will not require additional capital. If needed, we may seek funding through the sale of equity or debt financing. Funding that includes the sale of our equity may be dilutive. If such funding is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to further pursue our business plan and we may be unable to continue operations, in which case you may lose your entire investment.\nWe are currently under agreement with Veolia for the operations of TRIC, however there can be no assurance that we will continue to partner with Veolia. In February 2019, we entered into an Operations, Management and Maintenance Agreement with Veolia North America Regeneration Services, LLC, or Veolia. Pursuant to the Agreement, Veolia agreed to provide development of\noperations programs, start-up of new equipment and operations, maintenance and management services at our AquaRefining facility at TRIC. As a result of the November 2019 fire at TRIC, we have suspended all operations at TRIC pending our clean-up of the fire damage and development of our plan for resuming operations. In January 2020, we declared a force majeure under the Veolia Operations, Management and Maintenance Agreement and suspended payments to Veolia thereunder. If we follow through with our plans not to restore TRIC, we would expect that our Operations, Management and Maintenance Agreement would expire according to its terms in February 2021. The Operations, Management and Maintenance Agreement with Veolia contemplates entering into good faith negotiations with Veolia for a long-term agreement concerning Veolia\u2019s participation in the commercial licensing and management of our future AquaRefining facilities developed by licensees of Aqua Metals. We have agreed with Veolia to use our good faith commercial best-efforts to conclude negotiations for the long-term licensing and future facilities agreement by June 30, 2020. Because of the force majeure and suspension of activity with Veolia there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate and conclude definitive long-term agreements with Veolia on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to conclude long-term agreements with Veolia, it is likely that we will lose Veolia as our partner in the commercial licensing and management of our future AquaRefining facilities.\nWe are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to run our business, finance our capital needs and pursue business opportunities and activities. As of the date of this report, we are indebted to Green Bank for approximately $9.2 million ($8.6 million net of issuance costs), which is secured by liens on substantially all of our assets including insurance proceeds. The credit agreement governing such indebtedness contains covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions. These covenants could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. If we breach any of these covenants, the debt holder could declare a default under the credit agreement, in which case all of the indebtedness may then become immediately due and payable. If the debt under the credit agreement is accelerated, we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. In addition, since all of the indebtedness to Green Bank is secured by substantially all of our assets, a default under the credit facility could enable the debt holder to foreclose on its security interest and attempt to seize our assets. The affirmative and negative debt covenants could materially adversely impact our ability to operate and finance our business. In addition, our default under any of these covenants could subject us to accelerated debt payments or foreclosure proceedings that could threaten our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAdditionally, we were not in compliance with the minimum debt service coverage ratio covenant on our loan from Green Bank as of the fiscal quarter ends between March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2019. We received a waiver for the minimum debt service coverage ratio covenant for those periods. While we expect to continue to receive waivers from Green Bank for non-compliance with such covenant, there is no guarantee that we will receive such waivers. If Green Bank determines not to grant us a waiver for non-compliance in the future, we would be in default of the loan and Green Bank would be able to accelerate the payment of all amounts under the loan.\nIn the event of the acceleration of the Green Bank loan, we will need additional financing to satisfy our obligations under the loan, which additional financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. As noted above, as of the date of this report, we are indebted to Green Bank for approximately $9.2 million ($8.6 million net of issuance costs). The credit agreement governing such indebtedness contain various affirmative and negative covenants and if we breach any of these covenants, the debt holder could declare a default under the credit agreement, in which case all of the indebtedness may then become immediately due and payable. If the debt under the credit agreement is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to make the accelerated payments, in which case we would be required to seek additional funds through various financing sources, most likely through the sale of our equity or debt securities. However, there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Further, any sale of our equity or equity-linked securities will result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nOur outstanding debt may make it difficult for us obtain additional financing using our future operating cash flow. We currently owe approximately $9.2 million to Green Bank as of the date of this report. Such indebtedness could limit our ability to borrow additional funds to fund operations or expansion or increase the cost of any such borrowing, or both. Our inability to conduct additional debt financing could:\n\u2022limit our flexibility in developing our business operations and planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to, and reduce our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged.\nAny of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance our business and our operations.\nOur business model is new and has not been proven by us or anyone else. We are engaged in the business of producing recycled lead through a novel, and proven on a modest scale, technology. While the production of recycled lead is an established business, to date all recycled lead has been produced by way of traditional smelting processes. To our knowledge, no one has successfully produced recycled lead in commercial quantities other than by way of smelting. In addition, neither we nor anyone else has ever successfully built a production line that commercially recycles LABs without smelting. Further, there can be no assurance that either we or our licensees will be able to produce AquaRefined lead in commercial quantities at a cost of production that will\nprovide us and our proposed licensees with an adequate profit margin. The uniqueness of our AquaRefining process presents potential risks associated with the development of a business model that is untried and unproven.\nCertain industry participants may have the ability to restrict our access to used LABs and otherwise focus significant competitive pressure on us. We believe that our primary competition will come from operators of existing smelters and other parties invested in the existing supply chain for smelting, both of which may resist the change presented by our AquaRefining process. Competition from such incumbents may come in the form of restricted access to used LABs. We believe that LAB manufacturers who also maintain their own smelting operations control a significant part of the market for used LABs. If LAB manufacturers and others involved in the reverse supply chain for used LABs attempt to restrict our access to used LABs, that may adversely affect our prospects and future growth. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively withstand the pressures applied by our competition.\nEven if we are successful in recycling lead using our processes, there can be no assurance that the AquaRefined lead will meet the certification and purity requirements of our potential customers. A key component of our business plan is to produce recycled lead through our AquaRefining process of the highest purity (at least 99.99% pure lead), which we refer to as AquaRefined lead. We believe that our AquaRefined lead will provide us with a revenue premium over the market price of lead on the London Metal Exchange, or LME, and, more importantly, our ability to produce AquaRefined lead will be vital to confirming the efficacy and relevancy of our proprietary technology. Our customers will require that our AquaRefined lead meet certain minimum purity standards and, in all likelihood, require independent assays to confirm the lead\u2019s purity. As of the date of this report, we have produced limited quantities of AquaRefined lead and in November 2018, Clarios confirmed its approval of the purity of our AquaRefined lead by providing to us official vendor approval to receive finished lead at its manufacturing facilities. However, we have not produced AquaRefined lead in significant commercial quantities and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so or, if we are able to produce AquaRefined lead in significant commercial quantities, that such lead will continue to meet the required purity standards of our customers.\nWhile we have been successful in producing AquaRefined lead in small volumes, there can be no assurance that we will be able to replicate the process, along with all of the expected economic advantages, on a large commercial scale either for us or our prospective licensees. Our commercial operations have primarily involved the production of lead compounds and plastics from recycled LABs, and more recently, the sale of lead bullion and AquaRefined lead. In April 2018, we commenced the limited production of cast lead bullion (mixture of lead purchased to prime the kettles and AquaRefined lead from our AquaRefining process), and in June 2018, we commenced the sale of pure AquaRefined lead in the form of two tonne blocks. While we believe that our development, testing and limited production to date has validated the concept of our AquaRefining process, the limited nature of our operations to date are not sufficient to confirm the economic returns on our production of recycled lead. There can be no assurance that we will be to produce AquaRefined lead in commercial quantities at a cost of production that will provide us and our proposed licensees with an adequate profit margin.\nOur business may be negatively affected by labor issues and higher labor costs. Our ability to maintain our workforce depends on our ability to attract and retain new and existing employees. As of the date of this report, none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider our labor relations to be acceptable. However, we could experience workforce dissatisfaction which could trigger bargaining issues, employment discrimination liability issues as well as wage and benefit consequences, especially during critical operation periods. We could also experience a work stoppage or other disputes which could disrupt our operations and could harm our operating results. In addition, legislation or changes in regulations could result in labor shortages and higher labor costs. There can be no assurance that we may not experience labor issues that negatively impact our operations or results of operations.\nOur intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business. As of the date of this report, we have secured granted/allowed patents in the following countries/regions: U.S. (9837689, allowed 14/957026), Canada (2930945), China (105981212, 107849634), Europe (3072180), Eurasia (32371), South Africa (2016-04083, 2017/08455, 2017/04123), South Korea (101739414, 101882932, 101926033), Honduras (80-2019), India (318321), Indonesia (IDP000061176), Japan (6173595, 6592088), Mexico (357027), OAPI (17808, 18736), Ukraine (118037, 119580), Vietnam (allowed 1-2016-02246) and Australia (2014353227, 2015350562, 2017213449).\nWe also have further patent applications pending in the United States and numerous corresponding patent applications pending in 20 additional jurisdictions relating to certain elements of the technology underlying our AquaRefining process and related apparatus and chemical formulations. However, no assurances can be given that any patent issued, or any patents issued on our current and any future patent applications, will be sufficiently broad to adequately protect our technology. In addition, we cannot assure you that any patents issued now or in the future will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented.\nEven patents issued to us may not stop a competitor from illegally using our patented processes and materials. In such event, we would incur substantial costs and expenses, including lost time of management in addressing and litigating, if necessary, such matters. Additionally, we rely upon a combination of trade secret laws and nondisclosure agreements with third parties and employees having access to confidential information or receiving unpatented proprietary know-how, trade secrets and technology to protect our\nproprietary rights and technology. These laws and agreements provide only limited protection. We can give no assurance that these measures will adequately protect us from misappropriation of proprietary information.\nOur processes may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which could lead to costly disputes or disruptions. The applied science industry is characterized by frequent allegations of intellectual property infringement. Though we do not expect to be subject to any of these allegations, any allegation of infringement could be time consuming and expensive to defend or resolve, result in substantial diversion of management resources, cause suspension of operations or force us to enter into royalty, license, or other agreements rather than dispute the merits of such allegation. If patent holders or other holders of intellectual property initiate legal proceedings, we may be forced into protracted and costly litigation. We may not be successful in defending such litigation and may not be able to procure any required royalty or license agreements on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur business strategy includes licensing arrangements and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances, however as of the date of this report we have no such agreements in place and there can be no assurance we will be able to do so. Failure to successfully integrate such licensing arrangements, joint ventures, or strategic alliances into our operations could adversely affect our business. We propose to commercially exploit our AquaRefining process primarily by licensing our technology to third parties and entering into joint ventures and strategic relationships with parties involved in the manufacture and recycling of LABs, including Clarios, among others. Although we are currently seeking to negotiate such an agreement with Clarios as further discussed in the following paragraph, as of the date of this report, we have not entered into any such licensing, joint venture or strategic alliance agreements, apart from our equipment supply agreement with Clarios, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on terms that benefit us, if at all. In addition, licensing programs, joint ventures and strategic alliances may involve significant other risks and uncertainties, insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the transaction, potential additional challenges in protecting our intellectual property, and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process, such as product quality, technology issues and legal contingencies. In addition, we may be unable to effectively integrate any such programs and ventures into our operations. Our operating results could be adversely affected by any problems arising during or from any licenses, joint ventures or strategic alliances.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate our key agreement with Clarios on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In February 2017, we entered into a series of agreements with Clarios, including an equipment supply agreement pursuant to which, among other things, we agreed to work with Clarios on the development of a program for the conversion of Clarios and certain strategic partners of Clarios\u2019 existing lead smelters throughout North and South America, China and Europe to a lead recycling process utilizing our AquaRefining technology and equipment, know-how and services. The equipment supply agreement discusses the development of the conversion program in general terms and contemplates that the parties will enter into a definitive development program agreement that is based on the general terms set forth in the equipment supply agreement and provides more detailed terms and conditions, including the economic obligations and rights of each party. We have agreed not to license our AquaRefining technology and equipment to third parties in the aforementioned regions until such time as we and Clarios have agreed on certain matters relating to the initial conversion of a Clarios facility. In June 2019, we entered into an agreement with Clarios to amend the equipment supply agreement pursuant to which we have agreed to use good faith, commercial best-efforts to conclude the discussion and negotiation of, and enter into, a development program agreement no later than the 90th day following our satisfaction of certain performance criteria agreed upon by Clarios and us, however those performance conditions were based on the operation of 16 AquaRefining modules at TRIC, which is unlikely. We have initiated discussions with Clarios to revise the performance conditions, however as of the date of this report we have been unable to reach an agreement with Clarios on revised performance standards. If we are unable to agree with Clarios on revised performance standards, we may be unable to sell AquaRefining equipment or license our AquaRefining technology to third-parties until the expiration of the Equipment Supply Agreement in June 2021 or the agreement\u2019s earlier termination. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate and conclude a definitive development program agreement with Clarios on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe division of Johnson Controls with which we interact was recently sold and there can be no assurance that the new owners of the division will maintain the same level of interest in and commitment to the proposed joint development of our AquaRefining technologies. On May 1, 2019, Johnson Controls International plc announced that it had completed the sale of its battery group assets, formerly held by Johnson Controls Battery Group, Inc., to Brookfield Business Partners L.P. The acquired battery group assets will operate under the name Clarios. Based on our conversations with Johnson Controls, it is our understanding that the agreements and proposed business projects between us and Johnson Controls Battery Group, Inc. (collectively, the \"Aqua Metals Collaboration\") are now under the control of Clarios, and that certain members of the former management of Johnson Controls Battery Group, Inc. will be employed in similar capacities by Clarios. We have also been advised that Clarios and Brookfield Business Partners L.P. have expressed their interest in continuing the Aqua Metals Collaboration initiated by us and Johnson Controls Battery Group, Inc. Although there can be no assurance that Clarios currently has, and/or will maintain, the same level of interest in our joint collaboration as its predecessor, as Clarios could, for example, no longer have an interest in our technologies or have competing priorities, we currently have no reason to believe that Clarios and Brookfield Business Partners L.P. have lost interest. In addition, the change of control of the battery group may cause disruptions and distractions that adversely affect its ability to further the Aqua Metals Collaboration. For these and other reasons, Johnson Controls\u2019 sale of its battery group assets to Brookfield Business Partners L.P. could possibly have a material adverse effect on the Aqua Metals Collaboration.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of suppliers of certain materials used in our AquaRefining process and our inability to obtain these materials as and when needed could cause a material disruption in our operations. Our AquaRefining process involves a significant number of elements, chemicals, solvents and other materials, in addition to used LABs. There are a limited number of suppliers of certain materials used in our AquaRefining process and, other than our Supply Agreement with Interstate Battery Recycling, LLC, we have no agreements in place for our supply of such materials. Our ability to conduct our AquaRefining process on a commercial scale will depend significantly on obtaining timely and adequate supply of these materials on competitive terms. Our inability to source these materials on a timely and cost-efficient manner could interrupt our operations, significantly limit our revenue sales and increase our costs. This factor could also impair our ability to meet our commitments to supply our customers. Our inability to obtain these materials as and when needed could cause a material disruption in our operations.\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in raw material prices and the price of our principal product, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, growth prospects and results of operations. Used LABs are our primary raw material and we believe that in recent years the cost of used LABs has been volatile at times. In addition, we believe that the cost of used LABs can be seasonal, with prices trending lower in the winter months (as automobile owners increase their purchase of new LABs, thereby putting a greater number of used LABs on the market) and trend higher in the spring (as the purchase of new LABs, and supply of used LABs, decreases). Our principal product, recycled lead, has also experienced price volatility from time to time as well. For example, the market price of lead on the LME during 2019 ranged from approximately $1,785 to $2,270 per tonne. While we intend to pursue supply and tolling arrangements as appropriate to offset any price volatility, the volatile nature of prices for used LABs and recycled lead could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, growth prospects and results of operations.\nGlobal economic conditions could negatively affect our prospects for growth and operating results. Our prospects for growth and operating results will be directly affected by the general global economic conditions of the industries in which our suppliers, partners and customer groups operate. We believe that the market price of our principal product, recycled lead, is relatively volatile and reacts to general global economic conditions. Lead prices decreased from $2,139 per tonne on May 5, 2015 to a low of $1,554 per tonne on November 23, 2015 because of fluctuations in the market. A month later, the price per tonne increased back up to approximately $1,900 per tonne at the end of 2019. Our business will be highly dependent on the economic and market conditions in each of the geographic areas in which we operate. These conditions affect our business by reducing the demand for LABs and decreasing the price of lead in times of economic downturn and increasing the price of used LABs in times of increasing demand of LABs and recycled lead. There can be no assurance that global economic conditions will not negatively impact our liquidity, growth prospects and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risks of conducting business outside the United States. A part of our strategy involves our pursuit of growth opportunities in certain international market locations. We intend to pursue licensing or joint venture arrangements with local partners who will be primarily responsible for the day-to-day operations. Any expansion outside of the US will require significant management attention and financial resources to successfully develop and operate any such facilities, including the sales, supply and support channels, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful or that our expenditures in this effort will not exceed the amount of any resulting revenues. Our international operations expose us to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the United States, such as:\n\u2022increased cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022diminished ability to protect our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022heightened price sensitivities from customers in emerging markets;\n\u2022our ability to establish or contract for local manufacturing, support and service functions;\n\u2022localization of our LABs and components, including translation into foreign languages and the associated expenses;\n\u2022compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022compliance with the Federal Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws;\n\u2022foreign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022laws favoring local competitors;\n\u2022weaker legal protections of contract terms, enforcement on collection of receivables and intellectual property rights and mechanisms for enforcing those rights;\n\u2022market disruptions created by public health crises in regions outside the United States;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including challenges presented by relationships with workers\u2019 councils and labor unions;\n\u2022issues related to differences in cultures and practices; and\n\u2022changing regional economic, political and regulatory conditions.\nU.S. Government regulation and environmental, health and safety concerns may adversely affect our business. Our operations in the United States will be subject to the federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws applicable to the reclamation of lead acid batteries including the Occupational Safety and Health Act (\"OSHA\") of 1970 and comparable state statutes. Our facilities will have to obtain environmental permits or approvals to expand, including those associated with air emissions, water discharges, and waste management and storage. We may face opposition from local residents or public interest groups to the installation and operation of our facilities. In addition to permitting requirements, our operations are subject to environmental health,\nsafety and transportation laws and regulations that govern the management of and exposure to hazardous materials such as the lead and acids involved in battery reclamation. These include hazard communication and other occupational safety requirements for employees, which may mandate industrial hygiene monitoring of employees for potential exposure to lead.\nWe are also subject to inspection from time to time by various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety regulatory agencies and, as a result of these inspections, we may be cited for certain items of non-compliance. For example, in August 2018, the Nevada Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or Nevada OSHA, delivered to us a citation and notification of penalty. The citation listed a number of items related to our compliance with Nevada OSHA\u2019s Lead Standard. We reached a settlement agreement with Nevada OSHA on the amount of penalties associated with the citation. We also agreed to engage a lead compliance expert to audit our facility at TRIC for compliance with all provision of the Lead Standard and to generate a written report with findings of any noncompliance, recommended corrective actions, and a time frame to correct the findings of noncompliance. We agreed with Nevada OSHA to correct all findings of noncompliance within the time frame proposed by the lead compliance expert in their report. The lead compliance expert has been engaged, has visited the facility at TRIC and has completed the written report. We have corrected all findings of noncompliance in a timely manner.\nFailure to comply with the requirements of federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws could subject our business to significant penalties (civil or criminal) and other sanctions that could adversely affect our business. In addition, in the event we are unable to operate and expand our AquaRefining process and operations as safe and environmentally responsible, we may face opposition from local governments, residents or public interest groups to the installation and operation of our facilities.\nThe development of new AquaRefining technology by us or our partners or licensees, and the dissemination of our AquaRefining process will depend on our ability to acquire necessary permits and approvals, of which there can be no assurance. As noted above, our AquaRefining processes will have to obtain environmental permits or approvals to operate, including those associated with air emissions, water discharges, and waste management and storage. In addition, we expect that any use of AquaRefining operations at our partner's facilities will require additional permitting and approvals. Failure to secure (or significant delays in securing) the necessary permits and approvals could prevent us and our partners and licensees from pursuing additional AquaRefining expansion, and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial results and growth prospects. Further, the loss of any necessary permit or approval could result in the closure of an AquaRefining and the loss of our investment associated with such facility.\nOur business involves the handling of hazardous materials and we may become subject to significant fines and other liabilities in the event we mishandle those materials. The nature of our operations involves risks, including the potential for exposure to hazardous materials such as lead, that could result in personal injury and property damage claims from third parties, including employees and neighbors, which claims could result in significant costs or other environmental liability. Our operations also pose a risk of releases of hazardous substances, such as lead or acids, into the environment, which can result in liabilities for the removal or remediation of such hazardous substances from the properties at which they have been released, liabilities which can be imposed regardless of fault, and our business could be held liable for the entire cost of cleanup even if we were only partially responsible. We are also subject to the possibility that we may receive notices of potential liability in connection with materials that were sent to third-party recycling, treatment, and/or disposal facilities under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), and comparable state statutes, which impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination, and for damages to natural resources. Liability under CERCLA is retroactive, and, under certain circumstances, liability for the entire cost of a cleanup can be imposed on any responsible party. Any such liability could result in judgments or settlements that restrict our operations in a manner that materially adversely effects our operations and could result in fines, penalties or awards that could materially impair our financial condition and even threaten our continued operation as a going concern.\nWe will be subject to foreign government regulation and environmental, health and safety concerns that may adversely affect our business. As our business expands outside of the United States, our operations will be subject to the environmental, health and safety laws of the countries where we do business, including permitting and compliance requirements that address the similar risks as do the laws in the United States, as well as international legal requirements such as those applicable to the transportation of hazardous materials. Depending on the country or region, these laws could be as stringent as those in the US, or they could be less stringent or not as strictly enforced. In some countries in which we are interested in expanding our business, such as Mexico and China, the relevant environmental regulatory and enforcement frameworks are in flux and subject to change. Compliance with these requirements will cause our business to incur costs, and failure to comply with these requirements could adversely affect our business.\nIn the event we are unable to present and operate our AquaRefining process and operations as safe and environmentally responsible, we may face opposition from local governments, residents or public interest groups to the installation and operation of our facilities.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nA securities class action lawsuit and shareholder derivative lawsuit are pending against us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A putative consolidated class action lawsuit and shareholder derivative lawsuit are pending against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers. These lawsuits may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. Although we deny the material allegations in the lawsuits and intend to defend ourselves vigorously, defending the lawsuits could result in substantial costs. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may be the target of securities-related litigation in the future, both related and unrelated to the existing class action and shareholder derivative lawsuits. Such litigation could divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, result in substantial costs, and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe maintain director and officer insurance that we regard as reasonably adequate to protect us from potential claims; however, we are responsible for meeting certain deductibles under the policies and, in any event, we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will adequately protect us from claims made. Further, as a result of the pending litigation, the costs of insurance may increase and the availability of coverage may decrease. As a result, we may not be able to maintain our current levels of insurance at a reasonable cost, or at all, which might make it more difficult to attract qualified candidates to serve as executive officers or directors.\nOur common stock is thinly traded and our share price has been volatile. Our common stock has traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, under the symbol \u201cAQMS\u201d, since July 31, 2015. Since that date, our common stock has at times been relatively thinly traded and subject to price volatility. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain a liquid market for our common shares. The stock market in general, and early stage public companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies. If we are unable to develop and maintain a liquid market for our common shares, you may not be able to sell your common shares at prices you consider to be fair or at times that are convenient for you, or at all. In addition, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, litigation has often been brought against that company and we may become the target of litigation as a result of price volatility. Litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources from our business. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have received a notice of delisting or failure to satisfy a continued listing rule from the Nasdaq. On January 15, 2020, we received a notice of delisting from the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC. The notice stated that we had fallen below compliance with respect to the continued listing standard set forth in Rule 5550(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules because the closing bid price of our common stock over the previous 30 consecutive trading-day period had fallen below $1.00 per share.\nPursuant to the notice and Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we have 180 days from the date of the notice, or until July 13, 2020, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement in Rule 5550(a)(2) by achieving a closing bid price for our common stock of at least $1.00 per share over a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. If we do not regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2) during the initial 180-day period, we may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance, subject to our compliance with the Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirement for market value of publicly-held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and our provision of certain undertakings to the Nasdaq. However, there can be no assurance that we will be afforded additional time to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement following the initial 180-day period. If we are unable to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) in a timely manner, the Nasdaq will commence suspension and delisting procedures.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act of 2012 and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. We are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (\u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to:\n\u2022not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements;\n\u2022exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments; and\n\u2022extended transition periods available for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nWe have chosen to \u201copt out\u201d of the extended transition periods available for complying with new or revised accounting standards, but we intend to take advantage of all of the other benefits available under the JOBS Act, including the exemptions discussed above. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\" until 2020, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1.07 billion, if we issue more than $1.07 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, or if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30.\nOur status as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act may make it more difficult to raise capital as and when we need it. Because of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. Investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our reporting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and have no plans to pay dividends. We plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent we have earnings, in order to pursue our business plan and cover operating costs and to otherwise become and remain competitive. We do not plan to pay any cash dividends with respect to our securities in the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you that we would, at any time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend. Therefore, you should not expect to receive cash dividends on our common stock.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market for our common stock. Of the 59,767,720 shares of our common stock outstanding as of the date of this report, approximately 49,746,137 shares are held by \u201cnon-affiliates\u201d and are freely tradable without restriction pursuant to Rule 144.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable provisions of Delaware law may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. The provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u2022limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022do not permit stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022do not provide for cumulative voting rights;\n\u2022establish an advance notice procedure for stockholders' proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors, and\n\u2022provide that all vacancies may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may limit our ability to engage in any business combination with a person who beneficially owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock unless certain conditions are satisfied. This restriction lasts for a period of three years following the share acquisition. These provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive you of the opportunity to sell your shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices. This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock.\nOur bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company. Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any our directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any our directors, officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This forum selection provision in our bylaws may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or any our directors, officers or other employees.", "PERMNO": 15493, "SIC": 4953, "TIC": "AQMS"}
