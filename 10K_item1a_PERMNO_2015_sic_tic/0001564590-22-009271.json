{"cik": "709337", "company": "FARMERS NATIONAL BANC CORP /OH/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following are certain risk factors that could materially and negatively affect our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause our actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. The risks that are discussed below are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected. Additional risks that are not presently\nknown or that we presently deem to be immaterial could also have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to General Economic and Market Conditions, including COVID-19 Pandemic\nChanges in economic, political, and market conditions may adversely affect our industry and our business.\nOur success depends in part on national and local economic, political, and market conditions as well as governmental monetary and other financial policies. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, money supply, governmental fiscal policies and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our asset quality, deposit levels and loan demand and, therefore, our earnings. Because we have a significant amount of real estate loans, additional decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. Adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings. If during a period of reduced real estate values we are required to liquidate the collateral securing loans to satisfy the debt or to increase our allowance for loan losses, it could materially reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition. The majority of our loans are to individuals and businesses in Northeast Ohio. Consequently, further significant declines in the economy in the area could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. It is uncertain when the negative credit trends in our market will reverse, and, therefore, future earnings are susceptible to further declining credit conditions in the market in which we operate.\nThe economic impact of COVID-19 or any other pandemic could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent upon the willingness and ability of our customers to conduct banking and other financial transactions. The spread of a highly infectious or contagious disease, such as COVlD-19, has negatively impacted global, national and local economies, which in turn has disrupted the businesses, activities, and operations of our customers, as well as our business and operations. Moreover, the COVID-19 outbreak continues to cause significant disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the United States. Furthermore, the pandemic could result in the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses, particularly if businesses remain required to operate at diminished capacities or are required to close again, the impact on the global, national and local economies worsen, or more customers draw on their lines of credit or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses. Our business operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with COVID-19.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of COVID-19, it is difficult to predict the full impact of COVID-19, including new variants thereof, on our business, financial condition, and result of operations. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. Among the factors outside of our control that may result in a significant and/or sustained decrease in business and/or cause our customers to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations to us include:\n\u2022\nthe outbreak, duration and severity of variants;\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and deployment of vaccines and the potential development of more contagious or vaccine-resistant variants;\n\u2022\nthe direct and indirect results of the pandemic, such as recessionary economic trends, including with respect to employment, wages and benefits, commercial activity, consumer spending and real estate market values;\n\u2022\ndeclines in collateral values for loans;\n\u2022\nfurther political, legal and regulatory actions and policies in response to the pandemic; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of our employees and third-party vendors to continue to work effectively during the course of the pandemic.\nThe spread of COVID-19, including new variants thereof, has also caused us to modify our business practices, including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events\nand conferences. Further, technology in employees\u2019 homes may not be as robust as in our offices and could cause the networks, information systems, applications, and other tools available to such employees to be more limited or less reliable. The continuation of these work-from-home measures also introduces additional operational risk, including increased cybersecurity risk from phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, all of which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss and could seriously disrupt our operations and the operations of any impacted customers.\nAlthough the economy has made a slight recovery and the impact to our lines of business has been less than material to date, the spread of new variants of COVID-19 could further impact our lines of business or negatively impact the business and operations of third-party service providers who perform critical services for us. Further, even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy will likely require time to recover, the length of which is unknown and during which the United States may experience a recession or market correction. Our business could be materially and adversely affected by such recession or market correction.\nWe continue to closely monitor COVID-19 and related risks as they evolve. To the extent the effects of COVID-19 adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Item.\nAdverse changes in the ability or willingness of our customers to meet their repayment obligations to the Company could adversely impact our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe impact of the U.S. elections on the regulatory landscape, capital markets, and the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including whether there will be any further economic stimulus from the federal government, could negatively impact our financial results. Our business consists mainly of making loans to salaried people or other wage earners who generally depend on their earnings to meet their repayment obligations, and our ability to collect on loans depends on the willingness and repayment ability of our customers. Adverse changes in the ability or willingness of a significant portion of our customers to repay their obligations to the Company, whether due to changes in general economic, political or social conditions, the cost of consumer goods, interest rates, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, prolonged public health crisis or a pandemic, such as COVID-19, or other causes, or events affecting our customers such as unemployment, major medical expenses, bankruptcy, divorce or death, could have a material effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses in our financial statements at a level considered adequate by Management to absorb probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date, based on estimates and assumptions at that date. However, the amount of actual future loan losses we may incur is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions within our various local markets, which may be beyond our control, and such losses may exceed current estimates. Although Management believes that the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses is adequate to absorb losses on any existing loans that may become uncollectible, we cannot estimate loan losses with certainty, and we cannot provide any assurances that our allowance for loan losses will prove sufficient to cover actual credit losses in the future. Credit losses in excess of our reserves may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn any event, any reduced liquidity could negatively impact our ability to be able to fund loans, or to pay the principal and interest on any of our outstanding debt securities at any time, including when due.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our income and financial condition.\nOur earnings and cash flow are dependent upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income generated by our interest-earning assets (consisting primarily of loans and, to a lesser extent, securities) and the interest expense generated by our interest-bearing liabilities (consisting primarily of deposits and wholesale borrowings). Our level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of our interest-earning assets, the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities, which, in turn, are impacted by external factors, such as the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board and market interest rates.\nInterest rates are beyond our control, and they fluctuate in response to general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits. While we have taken measures intended to manage the risks of operating in a changing interest rate environment, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in avoiding undue interest rate risk. See additional interest rate risk discussion under the Market Risk section found in Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDefaults by another larger financial institution could adversely affect financial markets generally.\nThe commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships between institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as \u201csystemic risk\u201d and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges, with which we and our subsidiaries interact on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a reference rate for financial instruments could negatively affect our income and expenses and the value of various financial instruments.\nLIBOR is used extensively in the United States and globally as a benchmark for various commercial and financial contracts, including adjustable rate mortgages, corporate debt, interest rate swaps and other derivatives. LIBOR is set based on interest rate information reported by certain banks, which may stop reporting such information after 2021. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. On November 30, 2020, to facilitate an orderly LIBOR transition, the OCC, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve Board jointly announced that entering into new contracts using LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021, would create a safety and soundness risk. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of 1-week and 2-month LIBOR, and immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining LIBOR settings. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates are ongoing, and the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) has recommended the use of a Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). SOFR is different from LIBOR in that it is a backward looking secured rate rather than a forward-looking unsecured rate.\nThese differences could lead to a greater disconnect between our costs to raise funds for SOFR as compared to LIBOR. For cash products and loans, ARRC has also recommended Term SOFR, which is a forward looking SOFR based on SOFR futures and may in part reduce differences between SOFR and LIBOR. There are operational issues, which may create a delay in the transition to SOFR or other substitute indices, leading to uncertainty across the industry. These consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives over loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit.\nWe have limited exposure to LIBOR, with total exposure as of December 31, 2021 of approximately $131.6 million. We do not believe the change to a benchmark like SOFR will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe extend credit to a variety of customers based on internally set standards and judgment. We manage credit risk through a program of underwriting standards, the review of certain credit decisions and an on-going process of assessment of the quality of credit already extended. Our credit standards and on-going process of credit assessment might not protect us from significant credit losses.\nWe take credit risk by virtue of making loans, extending loan commitments and letters of credit and, to a lesser degree, purchasing non-governmental securities. Our exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standards that emphasize \u201cin-market\u201d lending, while avoiding highly leveraged transactions as well as excessive industry and other concentrations. Our credit administration function employs risk management techniques to ensure that loans adhere to corporate policy and problem loans are promptly identified. While these procedures are designed to provide us with the information needed to implement policy adjustments where necessary, and to take proactive corrective actions, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in avoiding undue credit risk.\nWe have significant exposure to risks associated with commercial real estate and residential real estate in our primary markets.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 75.9% of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate and residential real estate loans, including real estate development, construction and residential and commercial mortgage loans. Consequently, real estate-related credit risks are a significant concern for us. The adverse consequences from real estate-related credit risks tend to be cyclical and are often driven by national economic developments that are not controllable or entirely foreseeable by us or our borrowers.\nOur business depends significantly on general economic conditions in the State of Ohio. Accordingly, the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, and the value of the collateral securing such loans, may be significantly affected by economic conditions in the regions we serve or by changes in the local real estate markets. A significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment, acts of terrorism or other factors beyond our control could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur indirect lending exposes us to increased credit risks.\nA portion of our current lending involves the purchase of consumer automobile installment sales contracts from automobile dealers located in Northeastern Ohio. These loans are for the purchase of new or late model used cars. We serve customers over a broad range of creditworthiness, and the required terms and rates are reflective of those risk profiles. While these loans have higher yields than many of our other loans, such loans involve significant risks in addition to normal credit risk. Potential risk elements associated with indirect lending include the limited personal contact with the borrower as a result of indirect lending through dealers, the absence of assured continued employment of the borrower, the varying general creditworthiness of the borrower, changes in the local economy and difficulty in monitoring collateral. While indirect automobile loans are secured, such loans are secured by depreciating assets and characterized by loan to value ratios that could result in us not recovering the full value of an outstanding loan upon default by the borrower. Delinquencies, charge-offs and repossessions of vehicles in this portfolio are always concerns. If general economic conditions worsen, we may experience higher levels of delinquencies, repossessions and charge-offs.\nCommercial and industrial loans may expose us to greater financial and credit risk than other loans.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 15.8% of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial loans. Commercial and industrial loans generally carry larger loan balances and can involve a greater degree of financial and credit risk than other loans. Any significant failure to pay on time by our customers would hurt our earnings and cause a significant increase in non-performing loans. The increased financial and credit risk associated with these types of loans are a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the size of loan balances, the effects of general economic conditions on income-producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. In addition, when underwriting a commercial or industrial loan, we may take a security interest in commercial real estate, and, in some instances upon a default by the borrower, we may foreclose on and take title to the property, which may lead to\npotential financial risks. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover the expected, lifetime losses in our loan portfolio.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses that we believe is a reasonable estimate of the expected losses within the CECL model, based on management\u2019s quarterly analysis of our loan portfolio. The determination of the allowance for credit losses requires management to make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loans, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. Additional information regarding our allowance for credit losses methodology and the sensitivity of the estimates can be found in the discussion of \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d included in \u201cITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur estimates of future credit losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in regulations and interest rates, which may be beyond our control, and the losses may exceed current estimates. We cannot be assured of the amount of timing of losses, nor whether the allowance for credit losses will be adequate in the future.\nIf our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover the expected losses from our loan portfolio, resulting in the need for additions to the allowance for credit losses which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses as part of their examination process and may require management to increase the allowance or recognize further loan charge-offs based on judgments different than those of management.\nOn June 16, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13 \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses,\u201d which replaced the incurred loss model with the CECL model, an expected loss model. The new accounting guidance was to have been adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2020. However, Section 4014 of the CARES Act provided financial institutions with optional temporary relief from having to comply with the CECL methodology which would have expired on December 31, 2020, and Section 540 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, further extended the relief period to the earlier of the first day of the fiscal year that begins after the date on which the national emergency concerning COVID-19 terminates or January 1, 2022. Following the approval of the CARES Act and Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, the Company elected to delay the implementation of CECL until January 1, 2021.\nThe new accounting guidance under the CECL model requires banks to record, at the time of origination, credit losses expected throughout the life of financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables, debt securities and reinsurance receivables, and off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor. Under the CECL model, we are required to use historical information, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts to estimate the expected credit losses. If the methodologies and assumptions we use in the CECL model prove to be incorrect, or inadequate, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient, resulting in the need for additional allowance for credit losses to be established, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe adoption of the CECL model by the Company resulted in a onetime adjustment to equity in the amount of $1.9 million, net of tax. As a result of the implementation of the CECL model, the time horizon over which we are required to estimate future credit losses expanded, which could result in increased volatility in future provisions for credit losses. We may also experience a higher or more volatile provision for credit losses due to higher levels of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs if commercial and consumer customers are unable to make scheduled loan payments.\nFurthermore, the pandemic could continue to result in the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses, particularly if businesses remain closed or operate at reduced capacities, the impact on the national economy continues to worsen, or more clients draw on their lines of credit or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses. Small and mid-sized businesses make up a significant portion of our commercial loan portfolio and are particularly vulnerable to adverse financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic due to their increased reliance on continuing cash flow to fund day-to-day operations. Although federal government programs such as the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) that are designed to support individuals, households and businesses impacted by the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, have sought, and may further seek, to provide relief to these types of businesses, there can be no assurance that these programs will succeed. As of December 31, 2021, we hold and service PPP loans. While a large number of our PPP borrowers have applied for and received full or partial forgiveness of their loan obligations, we still have credit risk on the remaining PPP loans in the event that a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which a loan was originated, funded or serviced, including any issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive funding. In such a case, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if the SBA has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any related loss from us.\nWe are subject to certain risks with respect to liquidity.\n\u201cLiquidity\u201d refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support our operations and to fulfill our obligations, including commitments to originate loans, to repay our wholesale borrowings and other liabilities and to satisfy the withdrawal of deposits by our customers. Our primary source of liquidity is our core deposit base, which is raised through our retail branch system. Core deposits - savings and money market accounts, time deposits less than $250 thousand and demand deposits-comprised approximately 96.1% of total deposits at December 31, 2021. Additional available unused wholesale sources of liquidity include advances from the FHLB, issuances through dealers in the capital markets and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers. Liquidity is further provided by unencumbered, or unpledged, investment securities that totaled $941.3 million at December 31, 2021. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale or pledging as collateral of loans and other assets could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could negatively affect our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or negative regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative news and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole, as evidenced by recent turmoil in the domestic and worldwide credit markets.\nOur business strategy includes continuing our growth plans. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nWe intend to continue pursuing a profitable growth strategy both within our existing markets and in new markets. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in significant growth stages of development. We cannot assure that we will be able to expand our market presence in our existing markets or successfully enter new markets or that any such expansion will not adversely affect our results of operations. Failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, future prospects, financial condition or results of operations and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Also, if we grow more slowly than anticipated, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, or acquisitions may not perform as expected.\nWe completed the acquisition of Cortland Bancorp in November of 2021. The successful integration of these acquisitions depends on our ability to manage the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses. Integrating operations is complex and requires significant efforts and expenses. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nemployees may voluntarily or involuntarily exit the Company because of the acquisitions;\n\u2022\nour management team may have its attention diverted while trying to integrate the acquired companies;\n\u2022\nwe may encounter obstacles when incorporating the acquired operations into our operations;\n\u2022\ndifferences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses;\n\u2022\npreviously undetected operational or other issues; and\n\u2022\nthe acquired operations may not otherwise perform as expected or provide expected results.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect each company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or could reduce each company\u2019s earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results after the acquisition.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, which could reduce our anticipated profitability.\nWe expect that our acquisitions will result in certain synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects, although we may not fully realize these expectations. Our assumptions underlying estimates of expected cost savings may be inaccurate or general industry and business conditions may deteriorate. In addition, our growth and operating strategies for acquired businesses may be different from the strategies that the acquired companies pursued. If these factors limit our ability to integrate or operate the acquired companies successfully or on a timely basis, our expectations of future results of operations, including certain cost savings and synergies expected to result from acquisitions, may not be met.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense, and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want or need. In order to attract and retain qualified employees, we must compensate them at market levels. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain our competitive position, our performance, including our competitive position, could suffer, and, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nStrong competition within our markets could reduce our ability to attract and retain business.\nWe encounter significant competition from banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage banks, and other financial service companies in our markets. Some of our competitors offer a broader range of products and services than we can offer as a result of their size and ability to achieve economies of scale. Such competition includes major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain more numerous banking locations and support extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Our ability to maintain our history of strong financial performance and return on investment to shareholders will depend in part on our continued ability to compete successfully in our market. Our financial performance and return on investment to shareholders also depends on our ability to expand the scope of available financial services to our customers. In addition to other banks, competitors include securities dealers, brokers, investment advisors and finance and insurance companies. The increasingly competitive environment is, in part, a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to utilize alternative methods to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits. Customers may also move money out of bank deposits in favor of other investments, including digital or cryptocurrency. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are exposed to operational risk.\nSimilar to any large organization, we are exposed to many types of operational risk, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. These risks are heightened in light of COVID-19.\nNegative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, social media and other marketing activities, the implementation of environmental, social, and governance practices, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to any of the foregoing. Negative public opinion could adversely affect our ability to attract and keep customers, and could expose us to litigation and regulatory action, and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or result in heightened volatility.\nGiven the volume of transactions we process, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process our transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical system flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. We may also be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages), which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss of liability. We are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are) and to the risk that our (or our vendors\u2019) business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information, whether through a data breach of our computer systems, third-party service providers\u2019 systems, by cyber-attack or otherwise, could severely harm our business.\nAs part of our financial institution business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential client and customer information on behalf of our subsidiaries and other third parties. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. If information security is breached, information could be lost or misappropriated, resulting in financial loss or costs to us or damages to others. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information, whether by us or by our vendors, could severely damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of litigation and liability, or disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We also depend on third-party vendors for components of our business infrastructure. While we have carefully selected these third-party vendors, we do not control their operations. Further, the operations of our third-party vendors could fail or otherwise become delayed as a result of COVID-19 and any new variants thereof. As such, our business and operations could be adversely affected in the event these vendors are unable to perform their various responsibilities and we are unable to timely and cost-effectively identify acceptable substitute providers.\nWe have not experienced any material loss relating to a cyber-attack or other information security breach, but there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks or attempted breaches, or incur resulting losses, in the future. Our risks with respect to these threats remains heightened due to the evolving sophistication and frequency of such threats. As cyber-attacks and other attempted information security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to spend significant additional resources in efforts to modify and enhance our protective measures or in investigating or remediating of security breaches or vulnerabilities.\nWe depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments.\nAs a financial holding company, we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries. Our principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common shares is dividends from these subsidiaries. Federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends that our banking and other subsidiaries may pay to us without regulatory approval. In the event our subsidiaries become unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to pay dividends on our outstanding common shares. Accordingly, our inability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further discussion of our ability to pay dividends can be found under the caption \u201cDividends and Transactions with Affiliates\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. Federal banking agencies have proposed extensive changes to their capital requirements; including raising required amounts and eliminating the inclusion of certain instruments from the calculation of capital. The final form of such regulations and their impact on the Company is unknown at this time, but may require us to raise additional capital. In addition, we may elect to raise capital to support our business or to finance acquisitions, if any,\nor for other anticipated reasons. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on financial performance, conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including the satisfaction or release of preemptive rights in the event of a common share offering, many of which are outside our control. Therefore, there can be no assurance additional capital can be raised when needed or that capital can be raised on acceptable terms. Impairment to our ability to raise capital may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to adapt to technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers while reducing costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address customer needs by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. This could include the development, implementation, and adaptation of digital or cryptocurrency, blockchain, and other \u201cfintech\u201d technology. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological changes affecting the financial services industry could negatively affect our growth, revenue and net income.\nRisks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nThe FDIC maintains the Deposit Insurance Fund to resolve the cost of bank failures. Since late 2008, the FDIC has taken various actions intended to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the Deposit Insurance Fund. Those actions included increasing assessment rates for all insured institutions, requiring riskier institutions to pay a larger share of premiums by factoring in rate adjustments based on secured liabilities and unsecured debt levels, and imposing special assessments. In addition, in 2011 the FDIC approved a final rule that changed the deposit insurance assessment base and assessment rate schedule, adopted a new large-bank pricing assessment scheme and set a target size for the Deposit Insurance Fund. The rule, as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, finalized a target size for the Deposit Insurance Fund at 2 percent of insured deposits. The FDIC recently adopted rules revising assessments in a manner that benefits banks with assets of less than $10 billion, although there can be no assurance that such assessments will not change in the future.\nWe have a limited ability to control the amount of premiums we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional financial institution failures or other significant legislative or regulatory changes, the FDIC may be required to increase assessment rates or take actions similar to those taken after 2008. Increases in FDIC insurance assessment rates may materially adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at the current rate or at all.\nLegislative or regulatory changes or actions, or significant litigation, could adversely impact us or the businesses in which we are engaged.\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated. We are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of our operations. Laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund, and not to benefit our shareholders. Regulations affecting banks and financial services businesses are undergoing continuous change, especially in light of COVID-19 and the stimulus programs issued in connection therewith, and management cannot predict the effect of these changes. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact us or our ability to increase the value of our business. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by an institution and the adequacy of an institution\u2019s allowance for loan losses. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against us could cause us to devote significant time and resources to defending our business and may lead to penalties that materially affect our shareholders and us.\nIn light of conditions in the global financial markets and the global economy that occurred in the last decade, regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. Most recently, the United States Congress and the federal agencies regulating the financial services industry have acted on an unprecedented scale in responding to the stresses experienced in the global financial markets. Some of the laws enacted by the United States Congress and regulations promulgated by federal regulatory agencies subject us, and other financial institutions to which such laws and regulations apply, to additional restrictions, oversight and costs that may have an impact on our business, results of operations or the trading price of our common shares. In addition to laws, regulations and actions directed at the operations of banks, proposals to reform the housing finance market consider winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which could negatively affect our sales of loans.\nIn addition to laws, regulations and actions directed at the operations of banks, proposals to reform the housing finance market consider winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which could negatively affect our sales of loans.\nEven a reduction in regulatory restrictions could adversely affect our operations and our shareholders if less restrictive regulation increases competition within the industry generally or within our markets.\nOur results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely impacted by issues arising in foreclosure practices, including delays in the foreclosure process, related to certain industry deficiencies, as well as potential losses in connection with actual or projected repurchases and indemnification payments related to mortgages sold into the secondary market.\nPrevious announcements of deficiencies in foreclosure documentation by several large seller/servicer financial institutions have raised various concerns relating to mortgage foreclosure practices. The integrity of the foreclosure process is important to our business, as an originator and servicer of residential mortgages. As a result of our continued focus of concentrating our lending efforts in our primary markets in Ohio, as well as servicing loans for the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), we do not anticipate suspending foreclosure activities. It is not clear at this time if any current or future state or federal moratoriums on foreclosures related to COVID-19 concerns will cause significant issues for the Bank. We previously reviewed our foreclosure procedures and concluded they are generally conservative in nature and do not present the significant documentation deficiencies underlying other industry foreclosure problems. Nevertheless, we could face delays and challenges in the foreclosure process arising from claims relating to industry practices generally, which could adversely affect recoveries and our financial results, whether through increased expenses of litigation and property maintenance, deteriorating values of underlying mortgaged properties or unsuccessful litigation results generally.\nIn addition, in connection with the origination and sale of residential mortgages into the secondary market, we make certain representations and warranties, which, if breached, may require us to repurchase such loans, substitute other loans or indemnify the purchasers of such loans for actual losses incurred in respect of such loans. Although we believe that our mortgage documentation and procedures have been appropriate and are generally conservative in nature, it is possible that we will receive repurchase requests in the future and we may not be able to reach favorable settlements with respect to such requests. It is therefore possible that we may increase our reserves or may sustain losses associated with such loan repurchases and indemnification payments.\nEnvironmental liability associated with commercial lending could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. In addition, we own and operate certain properties that may be subject to similar environmental liability risks.\nEnvironmental laws and evolving regulation may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws and regulations or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws or regulations may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures requiring the performance of an environmental site assessment before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these assessments may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.\nCompanies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and safety, diversity, labor conditions and human rights. Increased ESG-related compliance costs for us as well as among our third-party suppliers, vendors and various other parties within our supply chain could result in increases to our overall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, access to capital, and the price of our common shares.\nImpairment of investment securities, goodwill, other intangible assets, or deferred tax assets could require charges to earnings, which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations.\nQuarterly, the Company evaluates its security portfolio to see if any security has a fair value less that its amortized cost. Once these securities are identified, the Company performs additional analysis to determine whether the decline in fair value resulted from a credit loss or other factors. Under current accounting standards, goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indeterminate lives are no longer amortized but, instead, are assessed for impairment periodically or when impairment indicators are present. Assessment of goodwill and such other intangible assets could result in circumstances where the applicable intangible asset is deemed to be impaired for accounting purposes. Under such circumstances, the intangible asset\u2019s impairment would be reflected as a charge to earnings in the period. Deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent it is more likely than not they will be realized. Should management determine it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, a valuation allowance with a change to earnings would be reflected in the period.\nChanges and uncertainty in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local taxes, including income, excise, sales/use, payroll, financial institutions tax, withholding and ad valorem taxes. Changes to our taxes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and, as described in the above risk discussion and below, the fair value of net deferred tax assets. In addition, our customers are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local taxes. Changes in taxes paid by our customers may adversely affect their ability to purchase homes or consumer products, which could adversely affect their demand for our loans and deposit products. In addition, such negative effects on our customers could result in defaults on the loans we have made and decrease the value of mortgage-backed securities in which we have invested.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, among other changes, imposed additional limitations on the federal income tax deductions individual taxpayers may take for mortgage loan interest payments and for payments of state and local taxes, including real property taxes. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also imposed additional limitations on the deductibility of business interest expense and eliminated other deductions in their entirety, including deductions for certain home equity loan interest payments. Such limits and eliminations may result in customer defaults on loans we have made and decrease the value of mortgage-backed securities in which we have invested.\nAnti-takeover provisions could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control by a third party.\nProvisions of the Ohio General Corporation Law, our Amended Articles of Incorporation, and our Amended Code of Regulations, including a staggered board and supermajority voting requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or could have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us.\nWe may be a defendant from time to time in the future in a variety of litigation and other actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur subsidiaries and we may be involved from time to time in the future in a variety of litigation arising out of our business. Our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may we be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms, if at all.", "PERMNO": 13006, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FMNB"}
