{"cik": "1638381", "company": "Intec Pharma Ltd.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn March 2021, Intec Israel entered into a Merger Agreement with Decoy, pursuant to which, subject to the approval of Intec Israel shareholders and the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Decoy would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intec Parent, a successor entity to Intec Israel following redomestication to Delaware. If the merger is completed, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2021, the business of Decoy will become the business of Intec. You should carefully consider the factors described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report, including the Intec Israel audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Annual Report beginning on page, before deciding whether to invest in our ordinary shares. If any of the risks discussed below actually occur, Intec Israel\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. This could cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nSummary Risk Factors\nThe principal factors and uncertainties that make investing in our ordinary shares risky, include, among others:\nRisks Related to the Proposed Merger\n\u25cf There is no assurance that the Merger will be completed in a timely manner or at all. If the Merger is not consummated, our business could suffer materially and our stock price could decline.\n\u25cf The issuance of shares of common stock of Intec Parent to Decoy stockholders in the Merger will significantly dilute the voting power of our current shareholders.\n\u25cf Intec Israel and Decoy shareholders may not realize a benefit from the Merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the Merger.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\n\u25cf We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a history of operating losses, are not currently profitable, do not expect to become profitable in the near future and may never become profitable.\n\u25cf Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\n\u25cf Our business is subject to risks arising from the COVID-19 pandemic which has impacted and continues to impact our business.\n\u25cf We have incurred and could incur further impairment charges of our long-lived assets that could negatively affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Intec Israel Business and Operations\n\u25cf We seek to partner with third-party collaborators with respect to the development and commercialization of AP-CD/LD and for new custom-designed APs, and we may not succeed in establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships, which may significantly limit our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates successfully, if at all.\n\u25cf The members of our management team are important to the efficient and effective operation of our business, and we may need to add and retain additional leading experts.\n\u25cf We expect to face significant competition.\n\u25cf We have reduced the size of our organization, and we may encounter difficulties in managing our business as a result of this reduction, or the attrition that may occur following this reduction, which could disrupt our operations. In addition, we may not achieve anticipated benefits and savings from the reduction.\n\u25cf If we acquire or license additional technologies or product candidates, we may incur a number of additional costs, have integration difficulties and/or experience other risks that could harm our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Clinical Development, Manufacturing and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates\n\u25cf Our product candidates are at various stages of development and may never be commercialized.\n\u25cf Our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation and are at various stages of regulatory development and may never obtain regulatory approval.\n\u25cf Our product candidates and future product candidates will remain subject to ongoing regulatory requirements even if they receive marketing approval, and if we fail to comply with these requirements, we may not obtain such approvals or could lose those approvals that have been obtained, and the sales of any approved commercial products could be suspended.\n\u25cf Clinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement, and, as a result, we may suffer delays or suspensions to current or future trials, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to advance products and generate revenues.\n\u25cf Positive results in the previous clinical trials of one or more of our product candidates may not be replicated in future clinical trials of such product candidate, which could result in development delays or a failure to obtain marketing approval.\n\u25cf Our product candidates are manufactured through a compounding, film casting and assembly process, and if we or one of our materials suppliers encounters problems manufacturing our products or raw materials, our business could suffer.\n\u25cf We intend to rely on a third-party manufacturer to manufacture commercial quantities of AP-CD/LD, if approved, and we may rely on other third-party manufacturers for other product candidates and any failure by a third-party manufacturer or supplier may delay or impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\n\u25cf Our AP-CBD/THC, AP-THC and AP-CBD product candidates (collectively \u201cAP-Cannabinoids\u201d) use Cannabidiol and 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol individually or in combination, which are subject to U.S. and international controlled substance laws and regulations; our ability to commercialize any product containing these substances will depend, in part, on the ultimate classification of the product under these laws and regulations.\n\u25cf Reimbursement may not be available for our products, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\u25cf If we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third parties or these agreements are terminated or we otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose intellectual property rights that are important to our business.\n\u25cf If we fail to adequately protect, enforce or secure rights to the patents which were licensed to us or any patents we own or may own in the future, the value of our intellectual property rights would diminish and our business and competitive position would suffer.\n\u25cf Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\n\u25cf Patent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Ordinary Shares\n\u25cf The market price of our ordinary shares is volatile and you may sustain a complete loss of your investment.\n\u25cf We expect to be characterized as a passive foreign investment company for the taxable year ending December 31, 2020 and, as such, our U.S. shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences.\n\u25cf We must meet the Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s continued listing requirements and comply with the other Nasdaq rules, or we may risk delisting. Delisting could negatively affect the price of our ordinary shares, which could make it more difficult for us to sell securities in a financing and for you to sell your ordinary shares.\nRisks Related to Our Operations in Israel\n\u25cf Potential political, economic and military instability in the State of Israel, where some of our senior management, our head executive office, research and development, and manufacturing facilities are located, may adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u25cf We have received Israeli government grants for certain of our research and development activities. The terms of these grants may require us to satisfy specified conditions in order to manufacture products and transfer technologies outside of Israel. We may be required to pay penalties in addition to the repayment of the grants. Such grants may be terminated or reduced in the future, which would increase our costs.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Merger\nThere can be no assurance that the Merger will be completed in a timely manner or at all. If the Merger is not consummated, our business could suffer materially and our stock price could decline.\nThe Closing is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of closing conditions, as described in the Merger Agreement, including, among other things, (i) consummation of the Domestication Merger, (ii) approval of certain matters related to the Merger by the shareholders of Intec Israel and approval of the Merger by the stockholders of Decoy, (iii) the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, (iv) the continued listing of Intec Israel\u2019s ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market (and following the Domestication Merger, the shares of Intec Parent Common Stock) and the authorization for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market of the Merger Shares, (v) the receipt of a tax ruling from the Israel Tax Authority with respect to the Domestication Merger, (vi) the sale or other disposition of the Accordion Pill business, and (vii) a closing financing by Intec Israel or Intec Parent such that upon Closing (taking into account of the proceeds to be received with respect to such financing), the combined net cash of Intec Parent shall be not less than $30 million and not more than $50 million, and which represents an agreed minimum valuation derived from the exchange ratio for Intec Parent following the Closing. If the conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Merger may be materially delayed or abandoned. If the Merger is not consummated, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having consummated the Merger, we will be subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf we have incurred and expected to continue to incur significant expenses related to the Merger even if the Merger is not consummated;\n\u25cf we could be obligated to pay Decoy a break-up fee of up to $1,000,000 under certain circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement;\n\u25cf our collaborators and other business partners and investors in general may view the failure to consummate the Merger as a poor reflection on our business or prospects;\n\u25cf the price of our stock may decline;\n\u25cf we may not be able to meet Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing standards, which may lead to delisting procedures by Nasdaq; and\n\u25cf we also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to consummate the Merger or to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement.\nIf the Merger is not consummated, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and the market price of our common stock.\nIf the Merger is not completed, we may be unsuccessful in completing an alternative transaction on terms that are as favorable as the terms of the Merger with Decoy, or at all.\nWhile we have entered into the Merger Agreement with Decoy, the closing of the Merger may be delayed or may not occur at all and there can be no assurance that the Merger will deliver the anticipated benefits we expect or enhance shareholder value. If we are unable to consummate the Merger, our Board may elect to pursue an alternative strategy, one of which may be a strategic transaction similar to the Merger. Attempting to complete an alternative transaction like the Merger will be costly and time consuming, and we can give no assurances that such an alternative transaction would occur at all. Alternatively, our board of directors may elect to continue advancing the preclinical and clinical development of the Accordion Pill platform, which would require that we obtain additional funding, and to continue our efforts to seek potential collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements for our programs, including a sale or other divestiture of our program assets, or our board of directors could instead decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of our company. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders will depend heavily on the timing of such decision, and with the passage of time the amount of cash available for distribution will be reduced as we continue to fund our operations. In addition, if our board of directors were to approve and recommend, and our shareholders were to approve, a dissolution and liquidation of our company, we would be required to pay our outstanding obligations, as well as to make reasonable provision for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions in liquidation to our shareholders. Our commitments and contingent liabilities may include severance obligations, liabilities to the Israel Innovation Authority, and fees and expenses related to the Merger. As a result of this requirement, a portion of our assets may need to be reserved pending the resolution of such obligations. In addition, we may be subject to litigation or other claims related to a dissolution and liquidation. If a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, our board of directors, in consultation with its advisors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, holders of our ordinary shares could lose all or a significant portion of their investment in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company.\nThe issuance of shares of common stock of Intec Parent to Decoy\u2019s stockholders in the Merger will significantly dilute the voting power of our current shareholders.\nIf the Merger is completed, each outstanding share of Decoy common stock will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of our common stock of Intec Parent equal to the exchange ratio set forth in the Merger Agreement. Under the exchange ratio formula in the Merger Agreement, without taking into consideration the effect of the respective levels of cash and liabilities of each of Intec Israel and Decoy, following the Closing, the former Decoy stockholders immediately before the Merger are expected to own approximately 75% of the aggregate number of the outstanding securities of Intec Parent, and the shareholders of Intec Israel immediately before the Merger are expected to own approximately 25% of the aggregate number of the outstanding securities of Intec Israel, calculated on a fully-diluted basis. The actual allocation will be subject to adjustment based on, among other things, Decoy\u2019s and Intec Israel\u2019s net cash balance (including, in the case of Intec Pharma, any proceeds from any disposition of the Accordion Pill business), subject to certain exceptions. The Closing is conditioned on completion of a closing financing, which will dilute securityholders of both Intec Israel and Decoy on a pro-rata basis. The issuance of shares of our common stock to Decoy\u2019s stockholders in the Merger will significantly reduce the relative voting power of each share of our common stock held by our current shareholders. Consequently, our shareholders as a group will have significantly less influence over the management and policies of the combined company after the Merger than prior to the Merger.\nThe exchange ratio is not adjustable based on the market price of Intec Israel ordinary shares, so the merger consideration at the Closing may have a greater or lesser value than at the time the Merger Agreement was signed.\nThe Merger Agreement has set an exchange ratio formula that is based on the fully-diluted outstanding capital stock of Intec Israel and Decoy, after taking into account each company\u2019s outstanding options and warrants, irrespective of the exercise prices of such options and warrants, and Intec Israel\u2019s and Decoy\u2019s net cash balances, in each case a few days prior to the Closing. Any changes in the market price of Intec Israel\u2019s ordinary shares before the completion of the Merger will not affect the number of shares of Intec Parent common stock issuable to Decoy\u2019s stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Therefore, if before the completion of the Merger, the market price of Intec Israel ordinary shares declines from the market price on the date of the Merger Agreement, then Decoy\u2019s stockholders could receive merger consideration with substantially lower value than the value of such merger consideration on the date of the Merger Agreement. Similarly, if before the completion of the Merger the market price of Intec Israel ordinary shares increases from the market price of Intec Israel ordinary shares on the date of the Merger Agreement, then Decoy\u2019s stockholders could receive merger consideration with substantially greater value than the value of such merger consideration on the date of the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement does not include a price-based termination right. Because the exchange ratio does not adjust as a result of changes in the market price of Intec Israel ordinary shares, for each one percentage point change in the market price of Intec Israel ordinary shares, there is a corresponding one percentage point rise or decline, respectively, in the value of the total merger consideration payable to Decoy\u2019s stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nThe net cash balances of Intec Israel and Decoy at the Closing could result in their respective securityholders owning a smaller or larger percentage of Intec Parent.\nThe estimates of the respective ownership percentages of the securityholders of Intec Israel and Decoy contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are subject to adjustment prior to the Closing, based on, among other things, the final net cash positions of the companies at the Closing. Each of the companies\u2019 net cash positions depend on several factors including, among other things, the amount of permitted pre-closing financing raised, the proceeds, if any, that Intec Israel receives from the sale or other disposition of the Accordion Pill business, and the cash burn rate from signing of the Merger Agreement through to the Closing Date. In particular, since the sale or other disposition of the Accordion Pill business is a condition to Closing in connection with the Merger, Intec Israel may not realize the full value of the Accordion Pill business which would have the effect of reducing Intec Israel\u2019s net cash.\nUncertainty about the Merger may adversely affect the relationship of Intec Israel with Intec Israel\u2019s third party collaborators and manufacturer which could have a materially adverse effect on Intec Israel\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operation.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, Intec Israel agreed that prior to the Closing Date it would use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into one or more agreements providing for the sale, transfer or assignment or that it would otherwise take steps related to the divestment or disposal and satisfaction of liabilities of Intec Israel\u2019s Accordion Pill business, to be effected immediately after the Closing. In response to the announcement of the Merger, Intec Israel\u2019s third party collaborators and manufacturer may seek to change the terms or otherwise terminate their relationship with Intec Israel. Any such change in terms or termination could adversely impact Intec Israel\u2019s ability to enter into any such agreement to sell or otherwise dispose of the Accordion Pill business and/or reduce the value at which the According Pill business is sold, which in turn could result in the exchange ratio being less beneficial to Intec Israel shareholders. If Intec Israel is unable to enter into an agreement to sell or otherwise dispose of the Accordion Pill business, then Intec Israel may be forced to initiate steps towards the liquidation of the Accordion Pill business. If the Merger is not completed, any change in terms or termination of the relationship with a third party collaborator or manufacturer may have a material adverse effect on the ongoing viability of the Accordion Pill business, which would have a material adverse effect on Intec Israel\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to complete the Merger may result in Intec Israel or Decoy paying a termination fee or, in the case of Intec Israel, forfeit a deposit to Decoy and could significantly harm the market price of Intec Israel\u2019s ordinary shares and negatively affect the future business and operations of each company.\nIf the Merger is not completed and the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Intec Israel and Decoy may be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $1,000,000 and, in the case of Intec Israel, forfeit a deposit in the amount of $350,000 in favor of Decoy to cover transaction expenses. Even if a termination fee is not payable or the deposit is not forfeited in connection with a termination of the Merger Agreement, each of Intec Israel and Decoy will have incurred significant fees and expenses, such as legal and accounting fees, which must be paid whether or not the Merger is completed. Further, if the Merger is not completed, it could significantly harm the market price of Intec Israel\u2019s ordinary shares. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and the board of directors of Intec Israel determines to seek another business combination, there can be no assurance that Intec Israel will be able to find a partner and close an alternative transaction on terms that are as favorable or more favorable than the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger may be completed even though certain events occur prior to the Closing that materially and adversely affect Intec Israel or Decoy.\nThe Merger Agreement provides that either Intec Israel or Decoy can refuse to complete the Merger if there is a material adverse change affecting the other party between March 15, 2021, the date of the Merger Agreement, and the Closing. However, certain types of changes do not permit either party to refuse to complete the Merger, even if such change could be said to have a material adverse effect on Intec Israel or Decoy, including:\n\u25cf conditions generally affecting the industries in which Intec Israel or Decoy participate or the United States, Israel, or global economy or capital markets as a whole;\n\u25cf any failure of Intec Israel or Decoy to meet internal projections or forecasts or any change in the price or trading volume of Intec Israel\u2019s ordinary shares;\n\u25cf the execution, delivery, announcement or performance of the obligations under the Merger Agreement or the announcement, pendency or anticipated consummation of the Merger;\n\u25cf any natural disaster or any acts of terrorism, sabotage, military action or war or any escalation or worsening thereof, or any pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), man-made disasters, natural disasters, acts of God or other force majeure event, or any escalation or worsening thereof;\n\u25cf any change in accounting requirements or principles or any change in applicable laws, rules, or regulations; or\n\u25cf any change in net cash balances of Intec Israel or Decoy that result from operations in the ordinary course.\nIf adverse changes occur and Intec Israel and Decoy still complete the Merger, the market price of the Intec Parent\u2019s common stock may suffer. This in turn may reduce the value of the Merger to the shareholders of Intec Israel, Decoy or both.\nEven if the Merger is completed, Intec Parent will need to raise additional capital by issuing securities or debt or through licensing or similar arrangements, which may cause significant dilution to Intec Parent\u2019s stockholders, restrict Intec Parent\u2019s operations or require Intec Parent to relinquish proprietary rights. Future issuances of Intec Parent\u2019s common stock pursuant to options and warrants outstanding following the Merger and its equity incentive plans could result in additional dilution.\nFollowing the completion of the Merger, Intec Israel expects Intec Parent will need to raise additional capital in the future to funds its operations. Additional financing may not be available to Intec Parent when it needs it or may not be available on favorable terms. To the extent that Intec Parent raises additional capital by issuing equity securities, the terms of such an issuance may cause more significant dilution to the combined company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 ownership, and the terms of any new equity securities may have preferences over the combined organization\u2019s common stock. Any debt financing of the combined organization may involve covenants that restrict its operations. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of the combined organization\u2019s assets, as well as prohibitions on its ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem its stock or make investments. In addition, if Intec Parent raises additional funds through licensing or similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to current product candidates and potential products or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to the combined organization. In addition, the exercise of some or all of Intec Parent\u2019s outstanding options or warrants could result in additional dilution in the percentage ownership interest of Intec Israel or Decoy shareholders.\nSome Intec Israel and Decoy officers and directors have interests in the Merger that are different from yours and that may influence them to support or approve the Merger without regard to your interests.\nCertain officers and directors of Intec Israel and Decoy participate in arrangements that provide them with interests in the Merger that are different from yours, including, among others, the continued service as an officer or director of the combined organization, severance benefits, stock option vesting.\nIn addition, and for example, Decoy\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Michael Newman is expected to become a director and the Chief Scientific Officer of Intec Parent upon the Closing, and Intec Israel\u2019s directors and executive officers are entitled to certain indemnification and liability insurance coverage pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. These interests, among others, may influence the officers and directors of Intec Israel and Decoy to support or approve the Merger.\nThe market price of Intec Israel\u2019s ordinary shares following the Merger may decline as a result of the Merger.\nThe market price of Intec Israel\u2019s ordinary shares, or Intec Parent\u2019s shares of common stock after the Domestication Merger, may decline as a result of the Merger for a number of reasons including if:\n\u25cf investors react negatively to the prospects of the combined organization\u2019s product candidates, business and financial condition following the Merger;\n\u25cf the effect of the Merger on the combined organization\u2019s business and prospects is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts; or\n\u25cf the combined organization does not achieve the perceived benefits of the Merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts.\nIntec Israel and Decoy shareholders may not realize a benefit from the Merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the Merger.\nIf the combined organization is unable to realize the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger, Intec Israel\u2019s and Decoy\u2019s shareholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests in their respective companies without receiving the expected commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the combined organization is able to realize only part of the expected strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger.\nDuring the pendency of the Merger, Intec Israel and Decoy may not be able to enter into a business combination with another party at a favorable price, if at all, because of restrictions in the Merger Agreement, which could adversely affect their respective businesses.\nCovenants in the Merger Agreement impede the ability of Intec Israel and Decoy to make acquisitions, subject to certain exceptions relating to fiduciary duties or to complete other transactions that are not in the ordinary course of business pending completion of the Merger. As a result, if the Merger is not completed, the parties may be at a disadvantage to their competitors during such period. In addition, while the Merger Agreement is in effect, each party is generally prohibited from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or entering into certain extraordinary transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets (other than the sale or other disposition of the Accordion Pill business, in the case of Intec Israel), or other business combination outside the ordinary course of business with any third party, subject to certain exceptions relating to fiduciary duties. Any such transactions could be favorable to such party\u2019s shareholders.\nCertain provisions of the Merger Agreement may discourage third parties from submitting alternative takeover proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the arrangements contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement prohibit each of Intec Israel and Decoy from soliciting alternative takeover proposals or cooperating with persons making unsolicited takeover proposals, except in limited circumstances when such party\u2019s board of directors determines in good faith that an unsolicited alternative takeover proposal is or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior takeover proposal and that failure to cooperate with the proponent of the proposal would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the board of directors\u2019 fiduciary duties.\nBecause the lack of a public market for Decoy\u2019s capital stock makes it difficult to evaluate its, the stockholders of Decoy may receive shares of Intec Parent common stock in the Merger that have a value that is less than, or greater than, the fair market value of Decoy\u2019s capital stock.\nThe outstanding capital stock of Decoy is privately held and is not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it extremely difficult to determine the fair market value of Decoy. Because the percentage of Intec Parent common stock to be issued to Decoy\u2019s stockholders was determined based on negotiations between the parties, it is possible that the value of Intec Parent\u2019s common stock to be received by Decoy\u2019s stockholders will be less than the fair market value of Decoy, or Intec Parent may pay more than the aggregate fair market value for Decoy.\nLawsuits may be filed against us and the members of our board of directors arising out of the Merger, which may delay or prevent the Merger.\nPutative securityholder complaints, including securityholder class action complaints, and other complaints may be filed against us, our board of directors, Decoy, Decoy\u2019s board of directors and others in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The outcome of litigation is uncertain, and we may not be successful in defending against any such future claims. Lawsuits that may be filed against us, our board of directors, Decoy, or Decoy\u2019s board of directors could delay or prevent the Merger, divert the attention of our management and employees from our day-to-day business and otherwise adversely affect us financially.\nThe combined organization may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm the combined organization\u2019s business and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all costs and damages.\nIn the past, securities class action or shareholder derivative litigation often follows certain significant business transactions, such as the sale of a business division or announcement of a merger. The combined organization may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation is often expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect the combined organization\u2019s business.\nWe are substantially dependent on our remaining employees to facilitate the consummation of the Merger.\nAs of March 15, 2021, we had 44 employees, 36 of whom are full-time employees. Our ability to successfully complete the Merger depends in large part on our ability to retain certain remaining personnel. Despite our efforts to retain these employees, one or more may terminate their employment with us on short notice. The loss of the services of certain employees could potentially harm our ability to run our day-to-day business operations, as well as to fulfill our reporting obligations as a public company.\nYour rights as a shareholder will change as a result of the Domestication Merger.\nIn accordance with the Merger Agreement, we have agreed to re-domesticate Intec Israel from the State of Israel to the State of Delaware. Due to the differences between Delaware law and Israeli law and the differences between the governing documents of Intec Israel and Intec Parent, we are unable to adopt governing documents for Intec Parent that are identical to the governing documents for Intec Israel. We have sought to preserve in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Intec Parent a similar allocation of rights and powers between the shareholders and our board of directors that exists under Intec Israel\u2019s articles of association and Israeli law. Nevertheless, Intec Parent\u2019s proposed certificate of incorporation and bylaws differ from Intec Israel\u2019s articles of association, both in form and substance, and your rights as a shareholder will change.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a history of operating losses, are not currently profitable, do not expect to become profitable in the near future and may never become profitable.\nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that was incorporated in 2000. Since our incorporation, we have primarily focused our efforts on research and development and clinical trials. We are not profitable and have incurred losses since inception, principally as a result of research and development, clinical trials and general administrative expenses in support of our operations. We have not generated any revenue, expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. Regardless of whether the Merger is completed, we also expect to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses and losses may increase substantially in the foreseeable future if we:\n\u25cf initiate, either alone or with a partner, further clinical trials for our current and any new product candidates;\n\u25cf prepare new drug applications, or NDAs, for our product candidates, assuming that the clinical trial data support an NDA;\n\u25cf seek regulatory approvals for our current product candidates, or future product candidates, if any;\n\u25cf implement internal systems and infrastructure;\n\u25cf seek to in-license additional technologies for development, if any;\n\u25cf hire additional management and other personnel; and\n\u25cf move towards commercialization of our product candidates and future product candidates, if any.\nWe may out-license our ability to generate revenue from one or more of our product candidates, depending on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u25cf obtain favorable results from and progress the clinical development of our product candidates;\n\u25cf develop and obtain regulatory approvals in the countries and for the uses we intend to pursue for our product candidates;\n\u25cf subject to successful completion of registration, clinical trials and perhaps additional clinical trials of any product candidate, apply for and obtain marketing approval in the countries we intend to pursue for such product candidate; and\n\u25cf contract for the manufacture of commercial quantities of our product candidates at acceptable cost levels, subject to the receipt of marketing approval.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we had net losses of $47.6 million and $14.1 million, respectively, and we expect such losses to continue for the foreseeable future. As a result, we will ultimately need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues or achieve profitability in the future. If our product candidates do not advance to further clinical trials, fail in clinical trials or do not gain regulatory clearance or approval, or if our product candidates do not achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability, or substantial delays in achieving profitability, could negatively impact the value of our ordinary shares and our ability to raise additional financing. A substantial decline in the value of our ordinary shares would also affect the price at which we could sell shares to secure future funding, which could dilute the ownership interest of current shareholders.\nEven if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Accordingly, it is difficult to evaluate our business prospects. Moreover, our prospects must be considered in light of the proposed Merger, the negative outcome of the ACCORDANCE study, the discontinuation of the Novartis program, and the general uncertainty regarding our development programs and the risks and uncertainties encountered by an early-stage company in highly regulated and competitive markets, such as the biopharmaceutical market, where regulatory approval and market acceptance of our products are uncertain. There can be no assurance that our efforts will ultimately be successful or result in revenues or profits. As a result, our 2020 annual consolidated financial statements note that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe believe that we have adequate cash to fund our ongoing activities through the completion of the Merger and into the first quarter of 2022. However, changes may occur that would cause us to consume our existing cash prior to that time, including the costs to consummate the Merger. Prior to closing of the Merger we agreed, among other things, that we would use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into one or more agreements providing for the sale, transfer or assignment or that we would otherwise take steps related to the divestment or disposal and satisfaction of liabilities of our Accordion Pill business, to be effected immediately after Closing. Although we have entered into the Merger Agreement and intend to consummate the Merger, there is no assurance that it will be able to successfully complete the Merger on a timely basis, or at all. If, for any reason, the Merger is not consummated and we are unable to continue to operate the Accordion Pill business or identify and complete an alternative strategic transaction like the Merger, we may be required to dissolve and liquidate our assets. In such case, we would be required to pay all of our debts and contractual obligations, and to set aside certain reserves for potential future claims, and there can be no assurances as to the amount or timing of available cash left to distribute to our shareholders after paying our debts and other obligations and setting aside funds for reserves. We are also closely monitoring ongoing developments in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in disruptions to our partnering efforts and may negatively impact our commercial prospects and our ability to raise capital. As of the date of this Annual Report, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may materially impact our financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations is uncertain. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued its report on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 and included an explanatory paragraph stating that the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and negative cash outflows from operating activities. As a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The perception that we might be unable to continue as a going concern may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and could result in the loss of confidence by investors, suppliers and employees. If we cannot successfully continue as a going concern, our shareholders may lose their entire investment in our ordinary shares.\nOur business is subject to risks arising from the COVID-19 pandemic which has impacted and continues to impact our business.\nPublic health epidemics or outbreaks could adversely impact our business. In late 2019, a novel strain of COVID-19, also known as coronavirus, was reported in Wuhan, China. While initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in China, it has now spread to countries across the globe, including in Israel and the United States. Many countries around the world, including in Israel and the United States, have implemented significant governmental measures to control the spread of the virus, including temporary closure of businesses, severe restrictions on travel and the movement of people, and other material limitations on the conduct of business. We implemented remote working and work place protocols for our employees in accordance with government requirements. The implementation of measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in disruptions to our partnering efforts which depend, in part, on attendance at in-person meetings, industry conferences and other events. It is not possible at this time to estimate the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic could have on our operations, as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration and severity of the outbreak, and the actions that may be required to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact. In particular, the continued spread of COVID-19 globally could materially adversely impact our operations and workforce, including our research and development, partnering efforts, and our ability to raise capital, each of which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe will need substantial, additional capital in the future. If additional capital is not available, we will have to delay, reduce or cease operations.\nWe will need to raise substantial, additional capital to complete the research and development of all of our product candidates and for working capital and for general corporate purposes. In addition, we may choose to expand our current research and development focus, or other clinical operations. There is no assurance, however, that we will be successful in obtaining the level of financing needed for our operations and the research and development of our product candidates. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $14.7 million.\nIn addition, our future capital requirements may be substantial and will depend on many factors including:\n\u25cf our ability to enter into collaborative, licensing, and other commercial relationships;\n\u25cf adhering to patient recruitment in any clinical trials;\n\u25cf clinical trial results;\n\u25cf developing the Accordion Pill for the treatment of other conditions or indications beyond those currently being explored;\n\u25cf the cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and the cost of defending our patents;\n\u25cf the cost of prosecuting infringement actions against third parties;\n\u25cf the cost, timing and outcomes of seeking marketing approval of our product candidates;\n\u25cf the costs associated with commercializing our products if we receive marketing approval, and choose to commercialize our product candidates ourselves, including the cost and timing of establishing external, and potentially in the future, internal, sales and marketing capabilities to market and sell our product candidates;\n\u25cf subject to receipt of marketing approval, revenue received from sales of approved products, if any, in the future;\n\u25cf the costs associated with any product liability or other lawsuits related to our future product candidates or products, if any;\n\u25cf the costs associated with post-market compliance with regulatory requirements, and of addressing any allegations of non-compliance by regulatory authorities in countries where we plan to market and sell our products;\n\u25cf the demand for our products;\n\u25cf the costs associated with developing and/or in-licensing other research and development programs;\n\u25cf the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; and\n\u25cf the costs associated with being a public company.\nUnder General Instruction I.B.6 to Form S-3, or the Baby Shelf Rule, the amount of funds we can raise through primary public offerings of securities in any 12-month period using our registration statement on Form S-3 is limited to one-third of the aggregate market value of the ordinary shares held by non-affiliates of the Company. As of March 5, 2021, our public float was approximately $17.8 million, based on 4,481,501 ordinary shares held by non-affiliates and a price of $3.97 per share, which was the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market on March 5, 2021. We therefore are limited by the Baby Shelf Rule as of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, until such time as our public float exceeds $75 million. If we are required to file a new registration statement on another form, we may incur additional costs and be subject to delays due to review by the SEC Staff.\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate preclinical studies, clinical trials or other research and development activities for one or more of our product candidates or delay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial condition.\nBecause of our limited operating history, we may not be able to successfully operate our business or execute our business plan.\nWe have a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our proposed business and prospects. Our proposed business operations will be subject to numerous risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties associated with early-stage enterprises. Such risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf the absence of a lengthy operating history;\n\u25cf insufficient capital to fully realize our operating plan;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain FDA approvals in a timely manner, if ever, or that the approved label indications are sufficiently broad to make sale of the products commercially feasible;\n\u25cf expected continual losses for the foreseeable future;\n\u25cf operating in an environment that is highly regulated by a number of agencies;\n\u25cf social and political unrest;\n\u25cf operating in multiple currencies;\n\u25cf our ability to anticipate and adapt to a developing market(s);\n\u25cf acceptance of our Accordion Pill by the medical community and consumers;\n\u25cf limited marketing experience;\n\u25cf a competitive environment characterized by well-established and well-capitalized competitors;\n\u25cf the ability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel; and\n\u25cf reliance on key personnel.\nBecause we are subject to these risks, evaluating our business may be difficult, our business strategy may be unsuccessful and we may be unable to address such risks in a cost-effective manner, if at all. If we are unable to successfully address these risks our business could be harmed.\nWe have incurred and could incur further impairment charges of our long-lived assets that could negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that require an impairment assessment. In July 2019, we announced top-line results from our ACCORDANCE study which did not meet its target endpoints. We determined that the clinical trial results constituted a triggering event that required us to undertake an impairment test and as a result we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $13.7 million with respect to our production line and related production equipment for commercial scale manufacturing of AP-CD/LD. In the third quarter ended September 30, 2019, we recorded for the first time an impairment charge of approximately $9.8 million which was updated in the fourth quarter by approximately $3.9 million following a new impairment assessment performed at December 31, 2019 following changes in management assumptions. As of December 31, 2020, we performed an additional impairment test which determined that there is no need to record an additional impairment charge. Although no impairment charge was recorded in 2020, we could incur further impairment charges if we determine that the carrying value of our long-lived assets is reduced. In addition, any changes in the actual market conditions versus the assumptions used in the model to determine impairment charges could result in further impairment charges in the future. In the event that we determine that our long-lived assets are impaired, we may be required to record a non-cash charge that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Intec Israel Business and Operations\nWe have not yet commercialized any products or technologies, and we may never become profitable.\nWe have not yet commercialized any products or technologies, and we may never be able to do so. We do not know when or if we will complete any of our product development efforts, obtain regulatory approval for any product candidates incorporating our technologies or successfully commercialize any approved products. Due to the negative outcome of the ACCORDANCE study, the discontinuation of the Novartis program, and the general uncertainty regarding our development programs, we do not anticipate commercializing any products or technologies in the near future. Even if we are successful in developing products that are approved for marketing, we will not be successful unless these products gain market acceptance for appropriate indications at favorable reimbursement rates. The degree of market acceptance of these products will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the timing of regulatory approvals in the countries, and for the uses, we intend to pursue with respect to the commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u25cf the competitive environment;\n\u25cf the establishment and demonstration in, and acceptance by, the medical community of the safety and clinical efficacy of our products and their potential advantages over other therapeutic products;\n\u25cf our ability to enter into strategic agreements with a commercial-scale manufacturer and with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with strong marketing and sales capabilities;\n\u25cf the adequacy and success of distribution, sales and marketing efforts;\n\u25cf the establishment of external, and potentially, internal, sales and marketing capabilities to effectively market and sell our product candidates in the United States and other countries; and\n\u25cf the pricing and reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors, such as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other plan administrators.\nPhysicians, patients, third-party payors or the medical community in general may be unwilling to accept, utilize or recommend, and in the case of third-party payors, cover payment for, any of our current or future products or products incorporating our technologies. As a result, we are unable to predict the extent of future losses or the time required to achieve profitability, if at all. Even if we successfully develop one or more products that incorporate our technologies, we may not become profitable.\nWe seek to partner with third-party collaborators with respect to the development and commercialization of AP-CD/LD and for new custom-designed APs, and we may not succeed in establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships, which may significantly limit our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates successfully, if at all.\nOur business strategy relies on partnering with pharmaceutical companies to complement our internal development efforts. In July 2019, we announced top-line results from our ACCORDANCE study in which the ACCORDANCE study did not meet its target endpoints. We have completed the analysis of the full data set and we are currently seeking to partner AP-CD/LD as the basis for the strategy for AP-CD/LD moving forward. In addition, we entered into a research collaboration agreement with Merck for the development of a custom-designed AP for one of Merck\u2019s proprietary compound and entered into a cannabinoid research collaboration agreement with GW to explore using the AP platform for an undisclosed research program. We are seeking partners for the development of new custom-designed APs. We will be competing with many other companies as we seek partners for AP-CD/LD and for any new custom-designed APs and we may not be able to compete successfully against those companies. If we are not able to enter into collaboration arrangements for AP-CD/LD or for any new custom-designed APs, we may be required to undertake and fund further development, clinical trials, manufacturing and commercialization activities solely at our own expense and risk. If we are unable to finance and/or successfully execute those expensive activities, or we delay such activities due to capital availability, our business could be materially and adversely affected, and potential future product launch could be materially delayed, be less successful, or we may be forced to discontinue clinical development of these product candidates. Furthermore, if we are unable to enter into a commercial agreement for the development and commercialization of the custom-designed AP for Merck and GW\u2019s programs, then this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe process of establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships is difficult, time-consuming and involves significant uncertainty, including:\n\u25cf a collaboration partner may shift its priorities and resources away from our product candidates due to a change in business strategies, or a merger, acquisition, sale or downsizing;\n\u25cf a collaboration partner may seek to renegotiate or terminate their relationships with us due to unsatisfactory clinical results, manufacturing issues, a change in business strategy, a change of control or other reasons;\n\u25cf a collaboration partner may cease development in therapeutic areas which are the subject of our strategic collaboration;\n\u25cf a collaboration partner may not devote sufficient capital or resources towards our product candidates;\n\u25cf a collaboration partner may change the success criteria for a drug candidate thereby delaying or ceasing development of such candidate;\n\u25cf a significant delay in initiation of certain development activities by a collaboration partner will also delay payment of milestones tied to such activities, thereby impacting our ability to fund our own activities;\n\u25cf a collaboration partner could develop a product that competes, either directly or indirectly, with our drug candidate;\n\u25cf a collaboration partner with commercialization obligations may not commit sufficient financial or human resources to the marketing, distribution or sale of a product;\n\u25cf a collaboration partner with manufacturing responsibilities may encounter regulatory, resource or quality issues and be unable to meet demand requirements;\n\u25cf a partner may exercise a contractual right to terminate a strategic alliance;\n\u25cf a dispute may arise between us and a partner concerning the research, development or commercialization of a drug candidate resulting in a delay in milestones, royalty payments or termination of an alliance and possibly resulting in costly litigation or arbitration which may divert management attention and resources; and\n\u25cf a partner may use our products or technology in such a way as to invite litigation from a third party.\nAny collaborative partners we enter into agreements within the future may shift their priorities and resources away from our product candidates or seek to renegotiate or terminate their relationships with us. For example, in December 2019, we discontinued the development of a custom designed AP for a Novartis proprietary compound following an internal and revised commercial strategic assessment, in which Novartis advised us that this program no longer meets Novartis\u2019 mid to long-term strategic goals. If any collaborator fails to fulfill its responsibilities in a timely manner, or at all, our research, clinical development, manufacturing or commercialization efforts related to that collaboration could be delayed or terminated, or it may be necessary for us to assume responsibility for expenses or activities that would otherwise have been the responsibility of our collaborator. If we are unable to establish and maintain collaborative relationships on acceptable terms or to successfully transition terminated collaborative agreements, we may have to delay or discontinue further development of one or more of our product candidates, undertake development and commercialization activities at our own expense or find alternative sources of capital.\nIf we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into successful relationships with third parties to perform these services, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if and when they are approved.\nWe do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have no experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of products. To achieve commercial success for any product for which we have obtained marketing approval, we will need to establish a sales and marketing infrastructure or to out-license the product.\nIn the future, we may consider building a focused sales and marketing infrastructure to market AP-CD/LD and potentially other product candidates in the United States, if and when they are approved. There are risks involved with establishing our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. For example, recruiting and training a sales force could be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include:\n\u25cf our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians;\n\u25cf the lack of adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products;\n\u25cf the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u25cf unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we are unable to establish our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into successful arrangements with third parties to perform these services, our product revenues and our profitability, may be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute our product candidates inside or outside of the United States or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nThe members of our management team are important to the efficient and effective operation of our business, and we may need to add and retain additional leading experts. Failure to retain our management team and add additional leading experts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur executive officers and our management team are important to the efficient and effective operation of our business. Our failure to retain our management personnel, who have developed much of the technology we utilize today, or any other key management personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our future operations. Our success is also dependent on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly-trained technical and management personnel, among others, to continue the development and commercialization of our current and future products.\nAs such, our future success highly depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel required for the development, maintenance and expansion of our activities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified personnel. The loss of personnel or the inability to hire and retain additional qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe expect to face significant competition. If we cannot successfully compete with new or existing products, our marketing and sales will suffer and we may never be profitable.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved, we expect to compete against fully-integrated pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, operate larger research and development programs than we do, and have substantially greater financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in:\n\u25cf developing drugs;\n\u25cf undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials;\n\u25cf obtaining FDA approvals and addressing various regulatory matters and obtaining other regulatory approvals of drugs;\n\u25cf formulating and manufacturing drugs; and\n\u25cf launching, marketing and selling drugs.\nOur competitors are likely to include companies with marketed products and/or an advanced research and development pipeline. The development of different formulations or new chemical entities may remove any competitive advantage a product formulated with the Accordion Pill platform technology may present. Other companies are engaged in research and development of gastric retention technologies that may become competitive to or even superior to the capabilities of the Accordion Pill platform Technology.\nThere is a substantial risk of product liability claims in our business. We currently do not maintain product liability insurance and a product liability claim against us could adversely affect our business.\nWe may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products in response to product liability lawsuits, which may result in substantial losses.\nAny of our product candidates could cause adverse events, including injury, disease or adverse side effects. These adverse events may or may not be observed in clinical trials, but may nonetheless occur in the future. If any of these adverse events occur, they may render our product candidates ineffective or harmful in some patients, and our sales would suffer, materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, potential adverse events caused by our product candidates could lead to product liability lawsuits. If product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit the marketing and commercialization of our product candidates. Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks, which are inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products. We may not be able to avoid product liability claims. Product liability insurance for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is generally expensive, if available at all. We do not have product liability insurance (and currently have insurance coverage for each specific clinical trial, which covers a certain number of trial participants and which varies based on the particular clinical trial) and if we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we may be unable to clinically test, market or commercialize our product candidates. A successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage, if any, may cause us to incur substantial liabilities, and, as a result, our business, liquidity and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. In addition, the existence of a product liability claim could affect the market price of our ordinary shares.\nWe face continuous technological change, and developments by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive. If our new or existing product candidates are rendered obsolete or non-competitive, our marketing and sales will suffer and we may never be profitable.\nIf our competitors develop and commercialize products faster than we do, or develop and commercialize products that are superior to our product candidates, our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated. The extent to which any of our product candidates achieve market acceptance will depend on competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. Competition in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industry is intense and has been accentuated by the rapid pace of technology development. Our potential competitors include large integrated pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies that currently have drug and target discovery efforts, universities, and public and private research institutions. Almost all of these entities have substantially greater research and development capabilities and financial, scientific, manufacturing, marketing and sales resources than we do. These organizations also compete with us to:\n\u25cf attract parties for acquisitions, joint ventures or other collaborations;\n\u25cf license proprietary technology that is competitive with the technology we are developing;\n\u25cf attract funding; and\n\u25cf attract and hire scientific talent and other qualified personnel.\nOur competitors may succeed in developing and commercializing products earlier and obtaining regulatory approvals from the FDA more rapidly than we do. Our competitors may also develop products or technologies that are superior to those we are developing, and render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or non-competitive. If we cannot successfully compete with new or existing products, our marketing and sales could suffer and we may never be profitable.\nWe have reduced the size of our organization, and we may encounter difficulties in managing our business as a result of this reduction, or the attrition that may occur following this reduction, which could disrupt our operations. In addition, we may not achieve anticipated benefits and savings from the reduction.\nFollowing the negative outcome of the ACCORDANCE study, we reduced the size of our headcount by approximately 50%, designed to focus our cash resources mainly on research and development and business development activities. The restructuring, and the attrition thereafter, resulted in the loss of longer-term employees, the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise and the reallocation and combination of certain roles and responsibilities across the organization, all of which could adversely affect our operations. The restructuring and possible additional cost containment measures may yield unintended consequences, such as attrition beyond our intended reduction in headcount and reduced employee morale. In addition, the restructuring may result in employees who were not affected by the reduction in headcount seeking alternate employment, which would result in us seeking contract support at unplanned additional expense. In addition, we may not achieve anticipated benefits from the restructuring. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage our operations or recruit and retain qualified personnel, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure and operations, risks that we may not be able to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. We may also determine to take additional measures to reduce costs, which could result in further disruptions to our operations and present additional challenges to the effective management of our company. If our management is unable to effectively manage this transition and restructuring and additional cost containment measures, our expenses may be more than expected, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate insurance, our financial condition could be adversely affected in the event of uninsured or inadequately insured loss or damage. Our ability to effectively recruit and retain qualified officers and directors could also be adversely affected if we experience difficulty in obtaining adequate directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance.\nWe may not be able to obtain insurance policies on terms affordable to us that would adequately insure our business and property against damage, loss or claims by third parties. To the extent our business or property suffers any damages, losses or claims by third parties, which are not covered or adequately covered by insurance, our financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to maintain sufficient insurance as a public company to cover liability claims made against our officers and directors. If we are unable to adequately insure our officers and directors, we may not be able to retain or recruit qualified officers and directors to manage our Company.\nIf we acquire or license additional technologies or product candidates, we may incur a number of additional costs, have integration difficulties and/or experience other risks that could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe may acquire and in-license additional product candidates and technologies. Any product candidate or technologies we in-license or acquire will likely require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including extensive preclinical or clinical testing, or both, and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities, if any. All product candidates are prone to risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that the product candidate or product developed based on in-licensed technology will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot assure you that any product candidate that we develop based on acquired or licensed technology that is granted regulatory approval will be manufactured or produced economically, successfully commercialized or widely accepted or competitive in the marketplace. Moreover, integrating any newly acquired or in-licensed product candidates could be expensive and time-consuming. If we cannot effectively manage these aspects of our business strategy, our business may not succeed.\nA security breach or disruption or failure in a computer or communications systems could adversely affect us.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of our CROs and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an event were to occur and interrupt our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, loss of trade secrets or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, including protected health information or personal data of employees or former employees, access to our clinical data, or disruption of the manufacturing process, we could incur liability and the further development of our Accordion Pill could be delayed. We may also be vulnerable to cyber-attacks by hackers or other malfeasance. This type of breach of our cybersecurity may compromise our confidential information and/or our financial information and adversely affect our business or result in legal proceedings. Further, these cybersecurity breaches may inflict reputational harm upon us that may result in decreased market value and erode public trust.\nGlobal economic, capital market and political conditions could affect our ability to raise capital and could disrupt or delay the performance of our third-party contractors and suppliers.\nOur ability to raise capital may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks, including credit market conditions, levels of consumer and business confidence, exchange rates, levels of government spending and deficits, trade policies, political conditions, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt, emergence of a pandemic, or other widespread health emergencies (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency, including for example, the recent COVID-19 pandemic), and other challenges that could affect the global economy. These economic conditions affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. Tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing. Similarly, such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. Our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending.\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters and/or health epidemics, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nNatural disasters could severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage, health epidemic or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our office, manufacturing and/or lab spaces, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, CROs, clinical sites, third parties ongoing activities and schedules or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our plans and business for a substantial period of time.\nThe disaster recovery and business continuity plan we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to the Clinical Development, Manufacturing and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates\nOur product candidates are at various stages of development and may never be commercialized.\nThe progress and results of any future preclinical testing or future clinical trials are uncertain, and the failure of our product candidates and additional product candidates which we may license, acquire or develop in the future to receive regulatory approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition to the extent we are unable to commercialize any such products. For example, the negative outcome of our ACCORDANCE study had a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. None of our product candidates have received regulatory approval for commercial sale. In addition, we face the risks of failure inherent in developing therapeutic products. All our product candidates are not expected to be commercially available for several years, if at all.\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive regulation and are at various stages of regulatory development and may never obtain regulatory approval.\nOur product candidates must satisfy certain standards of safety and efficacy for a specific indication before they can be approved for commercial use by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities have full discretion over this approval process. We will need to conduct significant additional research, including testing in animals and in humans, before we can file applications for product approval. Typically, in the pharmaceutical industry, there is a high rate of attrition for product candidates in preclinical testing and clinical trials. Also, even though we believe that some of our product candidates may be eligible for FDA review under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, the FDA may not agree with that assessment, and may require us to submit the application under Section 505(b)(1) which usually requires more comprehensive clinical data than applications submitted under Section 505(b)(2). Even under Section 505(b)(2), satisfying FDA\u2019s requirements typically takes many years, is dependent upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. For example, a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including biotechnology companies, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials. In addition, delays or rejections may be encountered based upon additional government regulation, including any changes in legislation or FDA policy, during the process of product development, clinical trials and regulatory reviews. After clinical trials are completed, the FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process and may require us to conduct additional preclinical and clinical testing or to perform post-marketing studies.\nIn order to receive FDA approval or approval from foreign regulatory authorities to market a product candidate or to distribute our products, we must demonstrate through preclinical testing and through human clinical trials that the product candidate is safe and effective for its intended uses (e.g., treatment of a specific condition in a specific way subject to contradictions and other limitations). We anticipate that some foreign regulatory agencies will have different testing and approval requirements from those of the FDA. Even if we comply with all FDA requests, the FDA may ultimately reject or decline to approve one or more of our new drug applications, or it may grant approval for a narrowly intended use that is not commercially feasible. We might not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in a timely manner, if at all. Failure to obtain FDA approval of any of our product candidates in a timely manner or at all could severely undermine our business by delaying or halting commercialization of our products, imposing costly procedures, diminishing competitive advantages and reducing the number of saleable products and, therefore, corresponding product revenues.\nIf the FDA does not conclude that a given product candidate using our Accordion Pill technology satisfies the requirements for approval under the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, or if the requirements for approval of our product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, the approval pathway will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and entail significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated, and in any case may not be successful.\nWe intend to seek FDA approval for our product candidates implementing our Accordion Pill technology through the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, a NDA under Section 505(b)(2) is permitted to reference safety and effectiveness data submitted by the sponsor of a previously approved drug as part of its NDA, or rely on FDA\u2019s prior conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of that previously approved drug, or rely in part on data in the public domain. Reliance on data collected by others may expedite the development program for our product candidates by potentially decreasing the amount of clinical data that we would need to generate in order to obtain FDA approval. If the FDA does not allow us to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway as anticipated, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional data and information, and meet additional standards for product approval. If this were to occur, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval, and complications and risks associated with regulatory approval of our product candidates, would likely substantially increase. Moreover, our inability to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway may result in new competitive products reaching the market more quickly than our product, which would likely materially adversely impact our competitive position and prospects. Even if we are able to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, there is no guarantee this will ultimately lead to accelerated product development or earlier approval. A 505(b)(2) applicant may rely on the FDA\u2019s finding of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug only to the extent that the proposed product in the Section 505(b)(2) application shares characteristics (e.g., active ingredient, dosage form, route of administration, strength, indication, conditions of use) in common with the previously approved drug. To the extent that the previously approved drug and the drug proposed in the Section 505(b)(2) application differ (e.g., a product with a different dosage form or route of administration), the Section 505(b)(2) application must include sufficient data to support those differences.\nIn addition, the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are subject to special requirements designed to protect the patent rights of sponsors of previously approved drugs that may be referenced in a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. These requirements may give rise to patent litigation and mandatory delays in approval of our NDA for up to 30 months or longer depending on the outcome of any litigation. Further, it is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of a new product. Even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition. Amendments to the FDCA attempt to limit the delay that can be caused by a citizen petition to 150 days, although court action by a dissatisfied petitioner is a possibility and this could, in theory, adversely affect the approval process.\nMoreover, even if product candidates implementing our Accordion Pill technology are approved under Section 505(b)(2), the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the products may be marketed or to other conditions of approval, or may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the products.\nWe might be unable to develop any of our product candidates to achieve commercial success in a timely and cost-effective manner, or ever.\nEven if regulatory authorities approve any of our product candidates, they may not be commercially successful. Our product candidates may not be commercially successful because government agencies or other third-party payors may not provide reimbursement for the costs of the product or the reimbursement may be too low to be commercially successful. In addition, physicians and others may not use or recommend our products candidates, even following regulatory approval. A product approval, even if issued, may limit the uses for which such product may be distributed, which could adversely affect the commercial viability of the product. Moreover, third parties may develop superior products or have proprietary rights that preclude us from marketing our products. We also expect that our product candidates, if approved, will generally be more expensive than the non-Accordion Pill version of the same medication available to patients. Physician and patient acceptance of, and demand for, any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval or license will depend largely on many factors, including, but not limited to, the extent, if any, of reimbursement of costs by government agencies and other third-party payors, pricing, competition, the effectiveness of our marketing and distribution efforts, the safety and effectiveness of alternative products, and the prevalence and severity of side effects associated with such products. If physicians, government agencies and other third-party payors do not accept the use or efficacy of our products, we will not be able to generate significant revenue, if any.\nOur product candidates and future product candidates will remain subject to ongoing regulatory requirements even if they receive marketing approval, and if we fail to comply with these requirements, we may not obtain such approvals or could lose those approvals that have been obtained, and the sales of any approved commercial products could be suspended.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, any such product will remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements, including requirements relating to manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, distribution and record keeping. Even if regulatory approval of a product is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the uses for which the product may be marketed or the conditions of approval, or may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product, which could negatively impact us or our collaboration partners by reducing revenues or increasing expenses, and cause the approved product candidate not to be commercially viable. In addition, as clinical experience with a drug expands after approval, typically because it is used by a greater number and more diverse group of patients after approval than during clinical trials, side effects and other problems may be observed over time after approval that were not seen or anticipated during pre-approval clinical trials or other studies. Any adverse effects observed after the approval and marketing of a product candidate could result in limitations on the use of or withdrawal of FDA approval of any approved products from the marketplace. Absence of long-term safety data may also limit the approved uses of our products, if any. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities, or previously unknown problems with any approved commercial products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes are discovered, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions or other setbacks, including, without limitation, the following:\nsuspension or imposition of restrictions on the products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, including costly new manufacturing requirements;\n\u25cf warning letters;\n\u25cf civil or criminal penalties, fines and/or injunctions;\n\u25cf product seizures or detentions;\n\u25cf import or export bans or restrictions;\n\u25cf voluntary or mandatory product recalls and related publicity requirements;\n\u25cf suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf total or partial suspension of production; and\n\u25cf refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products or supplements to approved applications.\nIf we or our collaborators are slow to adapt, or are unable to adapt, to changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new regulatory requirements or policies, marketing approval for our product candidates may be lost or cease to be achievable, resulting in decreased revenue from milestones, product sales or royalties, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nClinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement, and, as a result, we may suffer delays or suspensions to current or future trials, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to advance products and generate revenues.\nHuman clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. Regulatory authorities, such as the FDA, may preclude clinical trials from proceeding. Additionally, the clinical trial process is time-consuming, failure can occur at any stage of the trial and we may encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by several factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf unforeseen safety issues;\n\u25cf clinical holds or suspension of a clinical trial by the FDA, us, ethics committees, or the DSMB to determine proper dosing;\n\u25cf lack of effectiveness or efficacy during clinical trials;\n\u25cf failure of our contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates in accordance with cGMP;\n\u25cf failure of third party suppliers to perform final manufacturing steps for the drug substance;\n\u25cf slower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment;\n\u25cf lack of healthy volunteers and patients to conduct trials;\n\u25cf inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment;\n\u25cf failure of third party contract research organizations to properly implement or monitor the clinical trial protocols;\n\u25cf failure of IRBs to approve or renew approvals of our clinical trial protocols;\n\u25cf inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical trial protocols; and\n\u25cf lack of sufficient funding to finance the clinical trials.\nAs noted above, we, regulatory authorities, IRBs or DSMBs may suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the regulatory authorities find deficiencies in our regulatory submissions or conduct of these trials. Any suspension of clinical trials will delay possible regulatory approval, if any, and adversely impact our ability to develop products and generate revenue.\nWe may be forced to abandon development of certain products altogether, which will significantly impair our ability to generate product revenues.\nUpon the completion of any clinical trial, if at all, the results of these trials might not support the claims sought by us. Further, success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and the results of later clinical trials may not replicate the results of prior clinical trials and preclinical testing. For example, our Phase III ACCORDANCE study failed to meet its target endpoints despite positive Phase II data. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans and effective for its indicated uses. Any such failure may cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination or suspension of, our clinical trials will delay the requisite filings with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues. If the clinical trials do not support our drug product claims, the completion of development of such product candidates may be significantly delayed or abandoned, which would significantly impair our ability to generate product revenues and would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nPositive results in the previous clinical trials of one or more of our product candidates may not be replicated in future clinical trials of such product candidate, which could result in development delays or a failure to obtain marketing approval.\nPositive results in the previous clinical trials of one or more of our product candidates may not be predictive of similar results in future clinical trials for such product candidate. For example, our Phase III ACCORDANCE study failed to meet its target endpoints despite positive Phase II data. Also, interim results during a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. We along with a number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in early-stage development. Accordingly, the results from the completed preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in later stage trials of such product candidates. Our clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials. Clinical trial results may be inconclusive, or contradicted by other clinical trials, particularly larger clinical trials. Moreover, clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain FDA or European Medicines Agency, or other applicable regulatory agency, approval for their products.\nOur product candidates are manufactured through a compounding, film casting and assembly process, and if we or one of our materials suppliers encounters problems manufacturing our products or raw materials, our business could suffer.\nWe and our contract manufacturers, if any, are, and will be, subject to extensive governmental regulation in connection with the manufacture of any pharmaceutical products. The FDA and foreign regulators require manufacturers to register manufacturing facilities. The FDA and foreign regulators also inspect these facilities to confirm compliance with cGMP or similar requirements that the FDA or foreign regulators establish. We and our contract manufacturers must ensure that all of the processes, methods and equipment are compliant with cGMP for drugs on an ongoing basis, as mandated by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and conduct extensive audits of vendors, contract laboratories and suppliers. The FDA will likely condition grant of any marketing approval, if any, on a satisfactory on-site inspection of our manufacturing facilities.\nWe currently manufacture our product candidates used in clinical testing and we order certain materials from single-source suppliers. If the supply of any of these single-sourced materials is delayed or ceases, we may not be able to produce the related product in a timely manner or in sufficient quantities, if at all, causing us to be unable to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market or continue to develop our technology, which could materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, a single-source supplier of a key component of one or more of our product candidates could potentially exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims or other terms relating to the single-sourced materials. Our materials suppliers may face manufacturing or quality control problems causing product production and shipment delays or a situation where the supplier may not be able to maintain compliance with the FDA\u2019s cGMP requirements, or those of foreign regulators, necessary to continue manufacturing our drug substance or raw materials. Drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, the DEA, and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP requirements and other governmental regulations and corresponding foreign standards. Any failure by us or our suppliers to comply with DEA requirements or FDA or foreign regulatory requirements could adversely affect our clinical research activities and our ability to market and develop our products.\nWe intend to rely on a third-party manufacturer to manufacture commercial quantities of AP-CD/LD, if approved, and we may rely on other third-party manufacturers for other product candidates and any failure by a third-party manufacturer or supplier may delay or impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have manufactured our product candidates for our preclinical studies, Phase I clinical trials, Phase II clinical trials and Phase III clinical trial in our own manufacturing facility. Completion of any future clinical trial and commercialization of our product candidates will require access to, or development of, facilities to manufacture a sufficient supply of our product candidates. Although we believe our facilities are sufficient to manufacture our product candidate needs for clinical trials, we may be incorrect and we may not have the resources or facilities to manufacture our product candidates for clinical trials.\nWith respect to any future commercialization of the AP-CD/LD, we have decided to rely on LTS, a third-party contract manufacturer. LTS will be the sole source of production of AP-CD/LD and the establishment of a manufacturing facility to produce commercial quantities of AP-CD/LD requires substantial investment. Producing products in commercial quantities requires developing and adhering to complex manufacturing processes that are different from the manufacture of products in smaller quantities for clinical trials, including adherence to regulatory standards. Although we believe that we have developed processes and protocols that will enable LTS to manufacture commercial-scale quantities of products at acceptable costs, we cannot provide assurance that such processes and protocols will enable us to manufacture in quantities that may be required for commercialization of AP-CD/LD with yields and at costs that will be commercially attractive. If LTS is unable to establish or maintain commercial manufacture of AP-CD/LD or are unable to do so at costs that we currently anticipate, our business could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if our current and future manufacturing and supply strategies are unsuccessful, we may be unable to conduct and complete any future Phase III clinical trials or commercialize our product candidates in a timely manner, if at all.\nWe have relied, and we expect to continue to rely, on third-party manufacturers for certain raw materials (excipients, solvents and active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs), and for the commercial manufacturing of our AP-CD/LD. Our reliance on third parties for the manufacture of these items increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of these items or will not be able to obtain such quantities at an acceptable cost or quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts. If the third-party manufacturers on whom we rely fail to supply these items and we need to enter into alternative arrangements with a different supplier, it could delay our product development activities, as we would have to requalify the casting and assembly processes pursuant to FDA requirements. If this failure of supply were to occur after we received approval for and commenced commercialization of AP-CD/LD, we might be unable to meet the demand for this product and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, because we do not have any control over the process or timing of the supply of the APIs used in AP-CD/LD, there is greater risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of these APIs at an acceptable cost or quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nManufacturing our product candidates is subject to extensive governmental regulation. Our failure or the failure of these third parties in any respect (including noncompliance with governmental regulations) could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nManufacturing our product candidates is subject to extensive governmental regulation. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Government Regulation.\u201d Future FDA, state and foreign inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers. Failure by our third-party manufacturers to pass such inspections and otherwise satisfactorily complete the FDA or foreign regulatory agency approval regimen with respect to our product candidates may result in regulatory actions such as the issuance of Form FDA 483 notices of observations or any foreign counterpart, warning letters or injunctions or the loss of operating licenses. Based on the severity of the regulatory action, our clinical or commercial supply of the items manufactured by third-party manufacturers could be interrupted or limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA or foreign regulatory agency-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product\u2019s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA\u2019s or foreign regulatory agency\u2019s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. The FDA will likely condition grant of any marketing approval, if any, on a satisfactory on-site inspection of our manufacturing facilities.\nIf we are unable to use our manufacturing facility for any reason, the manufacture of clinical supplies of our candidates would be delayed, which would harm our business.\nWe currently able to manufacture all clinical supply of all our product candidates at our own manufacturing facility. If we were to lose the use of our facility or equipment, our manufacturing facility and manufacturing equipment would be difficult to replace and could require substantial replacement lead time and substantial additional funds. Our facility may be affected by natural disasters, such as floods or fire, or we may lose the use of our facility due to manufacturing issues that arise at our facility, such as contamination or regulatory concerns following a regulatory inspection of our facility. We do not currently have back-up capacity. In the event of a loss of the use of all or a portion of our facility or equipment for the reasons stated above or any other reason, we would be unable to manufacture any of our product candidates until such time as our facility could be repaired, rebuilt or we are able to address other manufacturing issues at our facility. Although we currently maintain property insurance with personal property limits of up to NIS 40.0 million and business interruption insurance coverage of up to NIS 20.0 million for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from fire and other casualties, such insurance may not cover all occurrences of manufacturing disruption or be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses in the event of occurrences that are covered and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe are subject to extensive and costly government regulation.\nThe products we are developing and planning to develop in the future are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulation, including regulation by the FDA, the CMS, the HHS, including its Office of Inspector General, the Office of Civil Rights, which administers the privacy provisions of HIPAA, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, to the extent our products are paid for directly or indirectly by those departments, state and local governments, and their respective foreign equivalents. The FDA regulates the research, development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, record keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import and export of pharmaceutical products under various regulatory provisions. If any drug products we develop are tested or marketed abroad, they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments, whether or not we have obtained FDA approval for a given product and its uses. Such foreign regulation may be equally or more demanding than corresponding U.S. regulation.\nGovernment regulation substantially increases the cost and risk of researching, developing, manufacturing, and selling our products. Our failure to comply with these regulations could result in, by way of example, significant fines, criminal and civil liability, product seizures, recalls, withdrawals, withdrawals of approvals, and exclusion and debarment from government programs. Any of these actions, including the inability of our proposed products to obtain and maintain regulatory approval, would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition to government regulation, rules and policies of professional and other quasi and non-governmental bodies and organizations may impact the prescription of products, as well as the manner of their promotion, marketing, and education. Examples of such bodies are the American Medical Association, the Accreditation Council of Continuing Medical Education, American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians.\nElections in the United States could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and government policy. While it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur, changes at the federal level could significantly impact our business and the health care industry; we are currently unable to predict whether any such changes would have a net positive or negative impact on our business. To the extent that such changes have a negative impact on us or the health care industry, including as a result of related uncertainty, these changes may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our ordinary shares.\nWe are subject to additional federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to our business, and our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nIn the United States, our current and future activities with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors, patient organizations and customers are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct or will conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good, item, facility or service for which payment may be made under government healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u25cf the Anti-Inducement Law, which prohibits persons from offering or paying remuneration to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries to induce them to use items or services paid for in whole or in part by the Medicare or Medicaid programs;\n\u25cf the Ethics in Patient Referrals Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients for certain designated items or services where that physician or family member has a financial interest in the entity providing the designated item or service;\n\u25cf federal false claims laws, including the Federal False Claims Act, that prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other government healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent;\n\u25cf federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u25cf HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u25cf state and local law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; and\n\u25cf federal, state and local taxation laws applicable to the marketing and sale of our products.\nFurther, the PPACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity can now be found guilty of fraud or false claims under PPACA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statue constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. Possible sanctions for violation of these anti-kickback laws include monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs, imprisonment, and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions. Any violations of these laws, or any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPPACA also contains legislation commonly known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or Sunshine Act, which requires applicable drug and device manufacturers of covered pharmaceutical, biological, device and medical supplies to annually report to CMS information regarding payments and transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, and for CMS to annually collect and display information reported by device and pharmaceutical manufacturers. Pursuant to the Sunshine Act, CMS created the federal Open Payments Program, under which data collected for each calendar year is published by CMS in June of the following calendar year. For example, data that was submitted by applicable manufacturers for the 2019 calendar year was published on June 30, 2020. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not reported.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. If a law is enacted, many if not all, of the provisions of the PPACA may no longer apply to prescription drugs. While we are unable to predict what changes may ultimately be enacted, to the extent that future changes affect how any future products are paid for and reimbursed by government and private payers, our business could be adversely impacted. On December 14, 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled that the PPACA is unconstitutional as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the federal income tax reform legislation previously passed by Congress and signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, that eliminated the individual mandate portion of the PPACA. The case, Texas, et al, v. United States of America, et al., (N.D. Texas), is an outlier, but in 2019, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently upheld the lower court decision which was then appealed to the United States Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal on an expedited basis and so no decision is expected until the next Supreme Court term in early 2021. We are not able to state with any certainty what will be the impact of this court decision on our business pending further court action and possible appeals. In November 2020, Joseph Biden was elected President and, in January 2021, the Democratic Party obtained control of the Senate. As a result of these electoral developments, it is unlikely that continued legislative efforts will be pursued to repeal PPACA. Instead, it is possible that legislation will be pursued to enhance or reform PPACA. We are not able to state with certainty what the impact of potential legislation will be on our business.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal, state and local regulation of payments made to physicians for marketing. Some states, such as California, Massachusetts and Vermont, mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs, along with the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians, and some states limit or prohibit such gifts. Various trade associations, such as the Advanced Medical Technology Association for devices and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America for drugs, have adopted voluntary standards of ethical behavior that limit the amount of and circumstances under which payments made be made to physicians. Additionally, there are state and local laws that require pharmaceutical sales representatives to register or obtain a license with the state or locality and to disclose or report certain information about their interactions with physicians.\nThe scope and enforcement of these laws is uncertain and subject to change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. We cannot predict the impact on our business of any changes in these laws. Federal or state regulatory authorities may challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. Any state or federal regulatory review of us, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time-consuming.\nWe are subject to anti-kickback laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have adverse consequences to us.\nThere are extensive U.S. federal and state laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry that can result in significant criminal and civil penalties. These federal laws include: the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits certain business practices and relationships, including the payment or receipt of compensation for the referral of patients whose care will be paid by Medicare or other federal healthcare programs; the physician self-referral prohibition, commonly referred to as the Stark Law; the anti-inducement law, which prohibits providers from offering anything to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary to induce that beneficiary to use items or services covered by either program; the civil False Claims Act in 1986, or the False Claims Act, which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which authorizes the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to impose civil penalties administratively for fraudulent or abusive acts. In addition, the Sunshine Act requires device and drug manufacturers to report to the government any payments to physicians for consulting services, research activities, educational programs, travel, food, entertainment and the like.\nSanctions for violating these federal laws include criminal and civil penalties that range from punitive sanctions, damage assessments, monetary penalties, imprisonment, integrity obligations and other oversight, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or both, and debarment. As federal and state budget pressures continue, federal and state administrative agencies may also continue to escalate investigation and enforcement efforts to reduce or eliminate waste and to control fraud and abuse in governmental healthcare programs. Private enforcement of healthcare fraud has also increased, due in large part to amendments to the False Claims Act that were designed to encourage private persons, known as relators, to file qui tam actions on behalf of the government. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 further encouraged whistleblowers to file suit under the qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act. A violation of any of these federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. An investigation into the use by physicians of any of our products, if ever commercialized, may dissuade physicians from either purchasing or using them, and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize those products.\nIn addition, we are subject to analogous foreign laws and regulations, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances. Many of these laws differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nOur AP-CBD/THC, AP-THC and AP-CBD product candidates (collectively \u201cAP-Cannabinoids\u201d) use Cannabidiol and 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol individually or in combination, which are subject to U.S. and international controlled substance laws and regulations; our ability to commercialize any product containing these substances will depend, in part, on the ultimate classification of the product under these laws and regulations.\nOur AP-Cannabinoids product candidates for treatment of various pain indications, use pharmaceutically pure CBD, and THC, the latter of which is synthetically derived. These products are quite distinct from crude herbal \u201cmedical marijuana,\u201d and we intend to seek FDA approval for these products in accordance with the customary FDA approval process and based on adequate and well-controlled clinical studies. However, the active ingredients in our products are defined as controlled substances under the federal Controlled Substances Act. Under the CSA, the DEA may place each drug that has abuse potential into one of five categories. The five categories, referred to as Schedules I-V, carry different degrees of restriction. Each schedule is associated with a distinct set of controls that affect manufacturers, researchers, healthcare providers, and patients. The controls include registration with the DEA, labeling and packaging, production quotas, security, recordkeeping, and dispensing. Schedule I is the most restrictive, covering drugs that have \u201cno accepted medical use\u201d in the United States and that have high abuse potential.\nIf and when any of our product candidates receive FDA approval, the DEA will make a scheduling determination and place the product in a schedule other than Schedule I in order for it to be prescribed to patients in the United States. Accordingly, our ability to ultimately commercialize the product will depend in part on the ultimate scheduling classification determination by DEA for our product.\nThe FDA has stated that it will continue to facilitate the work of companies interested in bringing safe, effective, and quality products to market, including scientifically-based research concerning the medical uses of products derived from marijuana and the FDA has approved synthetic compositions of the active ingredients found in marijuana. However, the use and abuse of controlled substances is currently subject to political and social pressures from certain constituencies related to their usage which could result in additional difficulty with respect to the approval of AP-Cannabinoids as a prescription pharmaceutical. For example, the FDA or DEA may require us to generate more clinical data about the potential for abuse than that which is currently anticipated, which could increase the cost and/or delay the launch of our product. In addition, DEA scheduling may limit our ability to achieve market share in the United States due to restricted access and the disinclination of some physicians to prescribe more restrictive scheduled controlled substances. For example, Schedule II drugs may not be refilled without a new prescription. These factors may limit the commercial viability of AP-Cannabinoids in the United States.\nMost countries are parties to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, which governs international trade and domestic control of narcotic substances, including the compounds in our AP-Cannabinoids product candidates. Countries may interpret and implement their treaty obligations in a way that creates a legal obstacle to our obtaining approval to market our AP-Cannabinoids product candidates. Approval to market in these countries could require amendments or modifications to existing laws and regulations that such countries would be unwilling to undertake or may cause material delays in any marketing approval.\nReimbursement may not be available for our products, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably.\nMarket acceptance and sales of our products will depend on coverage and reimbursement policies and may be affected by healthcare reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which products they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for our products. We also cannot be sure that the amount of reimbursement available, if any, will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully compete through sales of our proposed products.\nSpecifically, in both the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. In the United States, MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and certain others. Prior to MMA, Medicare did not cover most outpatient prescription drugs. MMA created a new voluntary Part D, which covers outpatient drugs for Medicare beneficiaries and is administered by private insurance plans that operate partially at-risk under contract with the CMS. These private Part D plans have incentives to keep costs down. MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of certain outpatient drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. These and future cost-reduction initiatives could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for our products, if approved, and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement under Medicare may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nIn March 2010, PPACA became law in the United States. The goal of PPACA is to reduce the cost of healthcare and substantially change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other measures, PPACA imposes increased rebates on manufacturers for certain covered drug products reimbursed by state Medicaid programs. The PPACA remains subject to continuing legislative scrutiny, including efforts by Congress to repeal and amend a number of its provisions, as well as administrative actions delaying the effectiveness of key provisions. In addition, there have been lawsuits filed by various stakeholders pertaining to certain portions of the PPACA that may have the effect of modifying or altering various parts of the law. Efforts to date to amend or repeal the PPACA have generally been unsuccessful. We ultimately cannot predict with any assurance the ultimate effect of the PPACA or changes to the PPACA on our Company, nor can we provide any assurance that its provisions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our ordinary shares. In addition, we cannot predict whether new proposals will be made or adopted, when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us if they are adopted.\nWe expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our products generally due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative proposals. If we fail to successfully secure and maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our future products or are significantly delayed in doing so, we will have difficulty achieving market acceptance of our products and our business will be harmed.\nWe expect the healthcare industry to face increased limitations on reimbursement, rebates and other payments as a result of healthcare reform, which could adversely affect third-party coverage of our products and how much or under what circumstances healthcare providers will prescribe or administer our products.\nIn both the United States and other countries, sales of our products will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, which include governmental authorities, managed care organizations and other private health insurers. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products and services.\nIncreasing expenditures for healthcare have been the subject of considerable public attention in the United States. Both private and government entities are seeking ways to reduce or contain healthcare costs. Numerous proposals that would effect changes in the U.S. healthcare system have been introduced or proposed in Congress and in some state legislatures, including reducing reimbursement for prescription products and reducing the levels at which consumers and healthcare providers are reimbursed for purchases of pharmaceutical products.\nIn the United States, the MMA changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. In recent years, Congress has considered further reductions in Medicare reimbursement for drugs administered by physicians. CMS has issued and will continue to issue regulations to implement the law which will affect Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors. Medicare, which is the single largest third-party payment program and which is administered by CMS, covers prescription drugs in one of two ways. Medicare part B covers outpatient prescription drugs that are administered by physicians and Medicare part D covers other outpatient prescription drugs, but through private insurers. Medicaid, a health insurance program for the poor, is funded jointly by CMS and the states, but is administered by the states; states are authorized to cover outpatient prescription drugs, but that coverage is subject to caps and to substantial rebates. CMS also has the authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products, which in turn would affect the price we can receive for those products. While the MMA and implementing regulations apply primarily to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the PPACA, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers and impose additional health policy reforms. As amended, the PPACA expanded manufacturers\u2019 rebate liability to include covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, increased the minimum rebate due for innovator drugs (both single source drugs and innovator multiple source drugs) from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP or the difference between the AMP and best price, whichever is greater. The total rebate amount for innovator drugs is capped at 100.0% of AMP. The PPACA and subsequent legislation also narrowed the definition of AMP. Furthermore, the PPACA imposes a significant annual, nondeductible fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with healthcare practitioners, and a significant number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective. The PPACA likely will continue to put pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. We ultimately cannot predict with any assurance the ultimate effect of the PPACA or changes to the PPACA on our Company, nor can we provide any assurance that its provisions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our ordinary shares. In addition, we cannot predict whether new proposals will be made or adopted, when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us if they are adopted.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, then President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, creates the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, starting in 2013. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, signed into law on November 2, 2015, increased the rebates that generic drug manufacturers are obligated to pay under the Medicaid program by applying an inflation-based rebate formula to generic drugs that previously only applied to brand name drugs. If we ever obtain regulatory approval and commercialization of any of our product candidates, these new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities or to lower prices for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates may be.\nIn November 2020, Joseph Biden was elected President and, in January 2021, the Democratic Party obtained control of the Senate. We are not able to state with certainty what the impact of potential legislation will be on our business.\nVarious states, such as California, have also taken steps to consider and enact laws or regulations that are intended to increase the visibility of the pricing of pharmaceutical products with the goal of reducing the prices at which we are able to sell our products. Because these various actual and proposed legislative changes are intended to operate on a state-by-state level rather than a national one, we cannot predict what the full effect of these legislative activities may be on our business in the future.\nAlthough we cannot predict the full effect on our business of the implementation of existing legislation, including the PPACA or the enactment of additional legislation pursuant to healthcare and other legislative reform, we believe that legislation or regulations that would reduce reimbursement for or restrict coverage of our products could adversely affect how much or under what circumstances healthcare providers will prescribe or administer our products. This could materially and adversely affect our business by reducing our ability to generate revenue, raise capital, obtain additional collaborators and market our products. In addition, we believe the increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of pharmaceutical products, which may adversely impact product sales.\nGovernments outside the United States tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues, if any.\nIn some countries, particularly the countries comprising the EU, the pricing of pharmaceuticals and certain other therapeutics is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed.\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance or unanticipated events during our clinical trials may occur, which may result in necessary changes to clinical trial protocols, which could result in increased costs to us, delay our development timeline or reduce the likelihood of successful completion of our clinical trials.\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance or unanticipated events during our clinical trials may occur, as a result of which we may need to amend clinical trial protocols. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for review and approval, which may adversely affect the cost, timing and successful completion of a clinical trial. If we experience delays in the completion of, or if we terminate, any of our clinical trials, the commercial prospects for our affected product candidates would be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue would be delayed, possibly materially.\nWe may be subject to extensive environmental, health and safety, and other laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions.\nOur business involves the controlled use, directly or indirectly through our service providers, of hazardous materials, various biological compounds and chemicals; therefore, we, our agents and our service providers may be subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing air emissions, water and wastewater discharges, noise emissions, the use, management and disposal of hazardous, radioactive and biological materials and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. The risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. If an accident, spill or release of any regulated chemicals or substances occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, including for investigation, remediation and monitoring of the contamination, including natural resource damages, the costs of which could be substantial. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials and chemicals. Although we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover the costs and expenses that may be incurred because of injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Additional or more stringent federal, state, local or foreign laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future. We may incur substantial capital costs and operating expenses and may be required to obtain consents to comply with any of these or certain other laws or regulations and the terms and conditions of any permits or licenses required pursuant to such laws and regulations, including costs to install new or updated pollution control equipment, modify our operations or perform other corrective actions at our respective facilities or the facilities of our service providers. For instance, we have undergone inspections and obtained approvals from various governmental agencies. We hold a business license with respect to testing, developing, storing and manufacturing pharmaceutical products at our current location from the municipality of Jerusalem, which is accompanied by additional terms and conditions approved by the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, or the Ministry of Environmental Protection. Our business license is valid until December 31, 2023 and we also hold a toxic substances permit from the Ministry of Environmental Protection (the Hazardous Material Division) and a Certificate of GMP Compliance of a Manufacturer from the Israeli Ministry of Health - Pharmaceutical Administration. Failure to renew any of the foregoing licenses and permits may harm our on-going and future operations. In addition, fines and penalties may be imposed for noncompliance with environmental, health and safety and other laws and regulations or for the failure to have, or comply with the terms and conditions of our business license or, required environmental or other permits or consents.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third parties or these agreements are terminated or we otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose intellectual property rights that are important to our business.\nWe license our core intellectual property from Yissum, an affiliate of Hebrew University and may need to obtain additional licenses from others to advance our research and development activities or allow the commercialization of the Accordion Pill. We initially entered into an exclusive license agreement with Yissum in 2000 and, in 2004 and 2005, we amended the license, which we refer to, as amended, as the License Agreement. According to the License Agreement, we hold an exclusive license for developing, manufacturing and/or world marketing of products that are directly or indirectly based on the patent owned by Yissum and/or other related intellectual property (including any information, research results and related know-how). Yissum is not permitted to transfer such intellectual property to third parties without our prior written consent. Yissum may obtain future financing from other entities for its research, provided that such entities will not be granted rights in its results (including other intellectual property rights) in a way prejudicing the rights granted to us in accordance with the License Agreement. We are entitled to grant perpetual sublicenses of this intellectual property to third parties, and such third parties will not be required to assume any undertaking towards Yissum. We are obligated to research and develop products that are based on the intellectual property of Yissum and to pay Yissum from the date of first sale an amount equal to 3% of our net sales of products based on the intellectual property and 15% from all other payments or benefits received from any such sublicense. In addition, also in consideration of the exclusive license granted to us pursuant to the License Agreement, we issued 5,618 ordinary shares to Yissum. As of the date of this Annual Report, no payments were paid and/or are due under the License Agreement. The License Agreement will be in effect until 15 years from the date of the first commercial sale. We also contracted with Yissum for laboratory services. In January 2008, we signed an addendum to the License Agreement to conduct an additional joint development and study regarding a technology, different from the Accordion Pill, for GR, of a drug. This addendum provides that the intellectual property rights produced as a result of the joint development and study will be jointly owned and we are entitled to receive a license for Yissum\u2019s share in these rights in return for payment of royalties. One patent application has been filed by Yissum and us as a result of the development related to that joint project, but this patent application was abandoned.\nThe License Agreement imposes certain payment, reporting, confidentiality and other obligations on us. In the event that we were to breach any of our obligations under the License Agreement and fail to cure such breach, Yissum would have the right to terminate the License Agreement upon 30 days\u2019 notice. In addition, Yissum has the right to terminate the License Agreement upon our bankruptcy or receivership.\nIn spite of our efforts, Yissum or any future licensor might conclude that we have materially breached our obligations under such license agreements and might therefore terminate the license agreements, thereby removing or limiting our ability to develop and commercialize products and technology covered by these license agreements. Most of our current product candidates are partly based on the intellectual property licensed under the License Agreement, and therefore if the License Agreement with Yissum was terminated, we may be required to cease our development and commercialization of the Accordion Pill. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMoreover, disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including:\n\u25cf the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u25cf the extent to which our product candidates, technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u25cf the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships;\n\u25cf our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u25cf the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners; and\n\u25cf the priority of invention of patented technology.\nIf we fail to adequately protect, enforce or secure rights to the patents which were licensed to us or any patents we own or may own in the future, the value of our intellectual property rights would diminish and our business and competitive position would suffer.\nOur success, competitive position and future revenues, if any, depend in part on our ability to obtain and successfully leverage intellectual property covering our products and product candidates, know-how, methods, processes and other technologies, to protect our trade secrets, to prevent others from using our intellectual property and to operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nThe risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our intellectual property rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf the degree and range of protection any patents will afford us against competitors;\n\u25cf if and when patents will be issued;\n\u25cf whether or not others will obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our own or licensed patents and patent applications;\n\u25cf we may be subject to interference proceedings;\n\u25cf we may be subject to opposition or post-grant proceedings in foreign countries;\n\u25cf any patents that are issued may not provide sufficient protection;\n\u25cf we may not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u25cf other companies may challenge patents licensed or issued to us or our customers;\n\u25cf other companies may independently develop similar or alternative technologies, or duplicate our technologies;\n\u25cf other companies may design around technologies we have licensed or developed;\n\u25cf enforcement of patents is complex, uncertain and expensive; and\n\u25cf we may need to initiate litigation or administrative proceedings that may be costly whether we win or lose.\nIf patent rights covering our products and methods are not sufficiently broad, they may not provide us with any protection against competitors with similar products and technologies. Furthermore, if the USPTO, or foreign patent offices issue patents to us or our licensors, others may challenge the patents or design around the patents, or the patent office or the courts may invalidate the patents. Thus, any patents we own or license from or to third parties may not provide any protection against our competitors.\nWe cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any pending applications, and we cannot be certain that any of our issued patents or patents licensed from Yissum (or any other third party in the future), will give us adequate protection from competing products. For example, issued patents, including the patents licensed by us, may be circumvented or challenged, declared invalid or unenforceable, or narrowed in scope.\nIn addition, since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make our inventions or to file patent applications covering those inventions.\nIt is also possible that others may obtain issued patents that could prevent us from commercializing our products or require us to obtain licenses requiring the payment of significant fees or royalties in order to enable us to conduct our business. As to those patents that we have licensed, our rights depend on maintaining our obligations to the licensor under the applicable license agreement, and we may be unable to do so.\nIn addition to patents and patent applications, we depend upon trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect our proprietary technology. We require our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to any other parties. We also require our employees and consultants to disclose and assign to us their ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions. These agreements may not, however, provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCostly litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights, and we may be subject to claims alleging the breach of license or other agreements that we have entered into with third parties or the violation of the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe may face significant expense and liability as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patents and other intellectual property rights of ours and others. In the event that another party has also filed a patent application or been issued a patent relating to an invention or technology claimed by us in pending applications, we may be required to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial uncertainties and costs for us, even if the eventual outcome were favorable to us. We, or our licensors, also could be required to participate in interference proceedings involving issued patents and pending applications of another entity. An adverse outcome in an interference proceeding could require us to cease using the technology or to license rights from prevailing third parties.\nWe have entered into license and collaboration agreements with other parties, including other pharmaceutical companies, and intend to continue to do so in the future. We and our counterparties to these agreements have granted and may grant each other, and have or may claim against each other, certain rights with respect to the other party\u2019s intellectual property and the intellectual property that we have or may jointly develop, including rights of co-ownership and rights of first refusal in the event that we or our counterparties seek to subsequently license or sell such intellectual property. For instance, a former partner under a terminated collaboration agreement previously indicated to us after the termination of such agreement that it believed it had a right of first offer with respect to a future license by us of certain intellectual property that existed in 2008 and is contained in AP-CD/LD. We do not believe that this party has any such right. However, the cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to our license and collaboration agreements, our licensed patents or patent applications or other intellectual property, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, divert management\u2019s resources and attention and delay or impair our ability to license or sell such intellectual property. Our ability to enforce our intellectual property protection could be limited by our financial resources, and may be subject to lengthy delays. A third party may claim that we are using inventions claimed by their intellectual property and may go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, such as research, development and the sale of any future products. Such lawsuits are expensive and would consume time and other resources. There is a risk that the court will decide that we are infringing the third party\u2019s intellectual property and will order us to stop the activities claimed by the intellectual property, redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement or obtain licenses (which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all). In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us to pay the other party damages for having infringed their patents. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our ordinary shares.\nMoreover, there is no guarantee that any prevailing patent or other intellectual property owner would offer us a license so that we could continue to engage in activities claimed by the patent or other intellectual property, or that such a license, if made available to us, could be acquired on commercially acceptable terms. In addition, third parties may, in the future assert other intellectual property infringement claims against us with respect to our product candidates, technologies or other matters. Any claims of infringement or other breach of license or collaboration agreement asserted against us, whether or not successful, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. However, our research, development and commercialization activities may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate patents or other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and inter parties re-examination proceedings before the USPTO, and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are pursuing development candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that the Accordion Pill or our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of the Accordion Pill or our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that the Accordion Pill or our product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the patents protecting the Accordion Pill or our product candidates, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire.\nSimilarly, if any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, including combination therapy, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or it may be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize the Accordion Pill or our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure.\nParties making claims against us may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products, including generics or biosimilars. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. For example, the patent family, IN-1, which we exclusively license from Yissum (i.e., Gastroretentive Controlled Release Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms), has expired in November 2020. This patent family relates to the foldable pharmaceutical gastroretentive drug delivery system for the controlled release of an active agent in the GI tract, which can be folded into a single capsule.\nIf we are not able to obtain patent term extension or non-patent exclusivity in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act and in foreign countries under similar legislation, thereby potentially extending the term of our marketing exclusivity for the Accordion Pill or any product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval, one of the U.S. patents covering our product candidates or the use thereof may be eligible for up to five years of patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows a maximum of one patent to be extended per FDA approved product as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only those claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Patent term extension also may be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval of our product candidates. Nevertheless, we may not be granted patent term extension either in the United States or in any foreign country because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the term of extension, as well as the scope of patent protection during any such extension, afforded by the governmental authority could be less than we request.\nIf we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration, or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our product may be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration sooner, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.\nIt is possible that we will not obtain patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act for a U.S. patent covering any of our product candidates even where that patent is eligible for patent term extension, or if we obtain such an extension, it may be for a shorter period than we had sought. Further, for our licensed patents, we do not have the right to control prosecution, including filing with the USPTO, a petition for patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Thus, if one of our licensed patents is eligible for patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, we may not be able to control whether a petition to obtain a patent term extension is filed, or obtained, from the USPTO.\nAlso, there are detailed rules and requirements regarding the patents that may be submitted to the FDA for listing in the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, or the Orange Book. We may be unable to obtain patents covering our product candidates that contain one or more claims that satisfy the requirements for listing in the Orange Book. Even if we submit a patent for listing in the Orange Book, the FDA may decline to list the patent, or a manufacturer of generic drugs may challenge the listing. If one of our product candidates is approved and a patent covering that product candidate is not listed in the Orange Book, a manufacturer of generic drugs would not have to provide advance notice to us of any abbreviated new drug application filed with the FDA to obtain permission to sell a generic version of such product candidate.\nIssued patents covering our product candidates could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court.\nIf we or one of our licensing partners initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering the Accordion Pill or our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post grant review, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover the Accordion Pill or our product candidates. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware of during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any of our employee\u2019s former employer or other third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nWe may become subject to claims for remuneration or royalties for assigned service invention rights by our employees, which could result in litigation and adversely affect our business.\nA significant portion of our intellectual property has been developed by our employees in the course of their employment for us. Under the Israeli Patent Law, 5727-1967, or the Patent Law, inventions conceived by an employee in the course and as a result of or arising from his or her employment with a company are regarded as \u201cservice inventions,\u201d which belong to the employer, absent a specific agreement between the employee and employer giving the employee service invention rights. The Patent Law also provides that if there is no such agreement between an employer and an employee, the Israeli Compensation and Royalties Committee, or the Committee, a body constituted under the Patent Law, shall determine whether the employee is entitled to remuneration for his inventions. Case law clarifies that the right to receive consideration for \u201cservice inventions\u201d can be waived by the employee and that in certain circumstances, such waiver does not necessarily have to be explicit. The Committee will examine, on a case-by-case basis, the general contractual framework between the parties, using interpretation rules of the general Israeli contract laws. Further, the Committee has not yet determined one specific formula for calculating this remuneration (but rather uses the criteria specified in the Patent Law). Although we generally enter into assignment-of-invention agreements with our employees pursuant to which such individuals assign to us all rights to any inventions created in the scope of their employment or engagement with us, we may face claims demanding remuneration in consideration for assigned inventions. As a consequence of such claims, we could be required to pay additional remuneration or royalties to our current and/or former employees, or be forced to litigate such claims, which could negatively affect our business. Further, litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship of our or of our licensors\u2019 ownership of our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property. If we or our licensors fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, intellectual property that is important to our product candidates. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on confidentiality agreements that could be breached and may be difficult to enforce, which could result in third parties using our intellectual property to compete against us.\nAlthough we believe that we take reasonable steps to protect our intellectual property, including the use of agreements relating to the non-disclosure of confidential information to third parties, as well as agreements that purport to require the disclosure and assignment to us of the rights to the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions of our employees and consultants while we employ them, the agreements can be difficult and costly to enforce. Although we seek to obtain these types of agreements from our contractors, consultants, advisors and research collaborators, to the extent that employees and consultants utilize or independently develop intellectual property in connection with any of our projects, we cannot be certain that such agreements have been entered into with all relevant parties, and we cannot be certain that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Furthermore, disputes may arise as to the intellectual property rights associated with our products. If a dispute arises, a court may determine that the right belongs to a third party. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees, contractors, consultants, advisors or others. Despite the protective measures we employ, we still face the risk that:\n\u25cf these agreements may be breached;\n\u25cf these agreements may not provide adequate remedies for the applicable type of breach;\n\u25cf our trade secrets or proprietary know-how will otherwise become known; or\n\u25cf our competitors will independently develop similar technology or proprietary information.\nWe also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our confidential proprietary information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems, but it is possible that these security measures could be breached. If any of our confidential proprietary information were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position.\nInternational patent protection is particularly uncertain, and if we are involved in opposition proceedings in foreign countries, we may have to expend substantial sums and management resources.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nChanges in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. Assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, prior to March 2013, in the United States, the first to invent the claimed invention was entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application was entitled to the patent. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, enacted in September 2011, the United States transitioned to a first inventor to file system in which, assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to invent the claimed invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after March 2013, but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by such third party. This will require us to be cognizant of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing or until issuance, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to either (i) file any patent application related to our product candidates or (ii) invent any of the inventions claimed in our or our licensor\u2019s patents or patent applications.\nThe America Invents Act also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and also may affect patent litigation. These include allowing third party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by USPTO administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter parties review, and derivation proceedings. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. Therefore, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our owned or in-licensed patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our owned or in-licensed issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIn addition, the patent positions of companies in the development and commercialization of pharmaceuticals are particularly uncertain. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. This combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the validity and enforceability of patents, once obtained. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could have a material adverse effect on our existing patent portfolio and our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property in the future.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Ordinary Shares\nThe market price of our ordinary shares is volatile and you may sustain a complete loss of your investment.\nOur ordinary shares currently trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The market price of our ordinary shares has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. The market price of our ordinary shares may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as:\n\u25cf the successful completion of the Merger;\n\u25cf inability to obtain the approvals necessary to commence further clinical trials;\n\u25cf results of clinical and preclinical studies;\n\u25cf announcements of regulatory approval or the failure to obtain it, or specific label indications or patient populations for its use, or changes or delays in the regulatory review process;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations, new products or product enhancements by us or others;\n\u25cf adverse actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our clinical trials, manufacturing supply chain or sales and marketing activities;\n\u25cf changes or developments in laws, regulations or decisions applicable to our product candidates or patents;\n\u25cf any adverse changes to our relationship with manufacturers, suppliers or partners;\n\u25cf announcements concerning our competitors or the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries in general;\n\u25cf achievement of expected product sales and profitability or our failure to meet expectations;\n\u25cf our commencement of or results of, or involvement in, litigation, including, but not limited to, any product liability actions or intellectual property infringement actions;\n\u25cf any major changes in our board of directors, management or other key personnel;\n\u25cf legislation in the United States, Europe and other foreign countries relating to the sale or pricing of pharmaceuticals;\n\u25cf announcements by us of significant strategic partnerships, out-licensing, in-licensing, joint ventures, acquisitions or capital commitments;\n\u25cf expiration or terminations of licenses, research contracts or other collaboration agreements;\n\u25cf public concern as to the safety of therapeutics we, our licensees or others develop;\n\u25cf success of research and development projects;\n\u25cf developments concerning intellectual property rights or regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf variations in our and our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if our ordinary shares are covered by analysts;\n\u25cf future issuances of ordinary shares or other securities;\n\u25cf general market conditions, including the volatility of market prices for shares of biotechnology companies generally, and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance;\n\u25cf political and economic instability, war or acts of terrorism or natural disasters, emergence of a pandemic, or other widespread health emergencies (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency, including for example, the recent COVID-19 pandemic); and\n\u25cf the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nThese factors and any corresponding price fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares, which would result in substantial losses by our investors.\nFurther, the stock market in general, the Nasdaq Capital Market and the market for biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies like ours. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our ordinary shares regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, a systemic decline in the financial markets and related factors beyond our control may cause our share price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly. Price volatility of our ordinary shares might be worse if the trading volume of our ordinary shares is low. In the past, following periods of market volatility, shareholders have often instituted securities class action litigation. If we were involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and attention of management from our business, even if we are successful. Future sales of our ordinary shares could also reduce the market price of such shares.\nMoreover, the liquidity of our ordinary shares will be limited, not only in terms of the number of ordinary shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but by potential delays in the timing of executing transactions in our ordinary shares and a reduction in security analyst and media\u2019s coverage of our Company, if any. These factors may result in lower prices for our ordinary shares than might otherwise be obtained and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and ask prices for our ordinary shares. In addition, without a large float, our ordinary shares will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our ordinary shares may be more volatile. In the absence of an active public trading market, an investor may be unable to liquidate its investment in our ordinary shares. Trading of a relatively small volume of our ordinary shares may have a greater impact on the trading price of our ordinary shares than would be the case if our public float were larger. We cannot predict the prices at which our ordinary shares will trade in the future.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they adversely change their recommendations or publish negative reports regarding our business or our ordinary shares, our share price and trading volume could be negatively impacted.\nThe trading market for our ordinary shares could be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts, and we cannot provide any assurance that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our ordinary shares, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our share price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our Company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could negatively impact our share price or trading volume.\nWe have not paid, and do not intend to pay, dividends on our ordinary shares and, therefore, unless our ordinary shares appreciate in value, our investors may not benefit from holding our ordinary shares.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares since inception. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. Moreover, the Israeli Companies Law, 5759-1999, or the Companies Law, imposes certain restrictions on our ability to declare and pay dividends. As a result, investors in our ordinary shares will not be able to benefit from owning our ordinary shares unless the market price of our ordinary shares becomes greater than the price paid for the shares by such investors and they are able to sell such shares. We cannot assure you that you will ever be able to resell our ordinary shares at a price in excess of the price paid for the shares.\nIt may be difficult for you to sell your ordinary shares at or above the purchase price therefor or at all.\nAlthough our ordinary shares now trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market, an active trading market for our ordinary shares may not be sustained. The market price of our ordinary shares is highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price as a result of various factors, some of which are beyond our control. It may be difficult for you to sell your ordinary shares without depressing the market price for the ordinary shares or at all. As a result of these and other factors, you may not be able to sell your ordinary shares at current market price or at all. Further, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling our ordinary shares and may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products by using our ordinary shares as consideration.\nThe tax benefits that are available to us require us to continue to meet various conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future, which could increase our costs and taxes.\nWe have obtained a tax ruling from the Israeli Tax Authority according to which our activity has been qualified as an \u201cindustrial activity,\u201d as defined in the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959, generally referred to as the Investment Law, and is eligible for tax benefits as a \u201cBenefited Enterprise,\u201d which will apply to the turnover attributed to such enterprise, for a period of up to ten years from the first year in which we generated taxable income. The tax benefits under the Benefited Enterprise status are scheduled to expire at the end of 2023.\nIn order to remain eligible for the tax benefits of a Benefited Enterprise, we must continue to meet certain conditions stipulated in the Investment Law and its regulations, as amended. In addition, in order to remain eligible for the tax benefits available to the Benefited Enterprise, we must also comply with the conditions set forth in the tax ruling. These conditions include, among other things, that the production, directly or through subcontractors, of all our products should be performed within certain regions of Israel. If we do not meet these requirements, the tax benefits would be reduced or canceled.\nThere is no assurance that our future taxable income will qualify as Benefited Enterprise income or that the benefits described above will be available to us in the future.\nFuture changes to tax laws could have a material adverse effect on us and reduce net returns to our shareholders.\nOur tax treatment is subject to changes in tax laws, regulations and treaties, or the interpretation thereof, tax policy initiatives and reforms under consideration and the practices of tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as tax policy initiatives and reforms related to the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development\u2019s, or OECD, Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, or BEPS Project, the European Commission\u2019s state aid investigations and other initiatives.\nSuch changes may include (but are not limited to) the taxation of operating income, investment income, dividends received or, in the specific context of withholding tax, dividends paid. We are unable to predict what tax reform may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business, but such changes, to the extent they are brought into tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices, could affect our financial position and overall or effective tax rates in the future in countries where we have operations, reduce post-tax returns to our shareholders, and increase the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance.\nIn addition, on December 22, 2017, U.S. federal income tax legislation was signed into law (H.R. 1, \u201cAn Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018\u201d), informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that significantly revised the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, among other things, contains significant changes to U.S. corporate income taxation, including the reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for business interest expense to business interest income plus 30% of adjusted taxable income (except with respect to certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and the modification or repealing of many business deductions and credits. Recent changes in the political makeup of the Senate and House of Representatives in the U.S. Congress could result in modifications to some or all of the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The overall impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including possible modification thereto, is uncertain, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. The impact on holders of our ordinary shares is also uncertain and could be adverse.\nWe urge you to consult with your legal and tax advisors with respect to the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our ordinary shares, including those stemming from recent and anticipated changes to tax laws.\nTax authorities may disagree with our positions and conclusions regarding certain tax positions, resulting in unanticipated costs, taxes or non-realization of expected benefits.\nA tax authority may disagree with tax positions that we have taken, which could result in increased tax liabilities. For example, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or another tax authority could challenge our allocation of income by tax jurisdiction and the amounts paid between our affiliated companies pursuant to our intercompany arrangements and transfer pricing policies, including amounts paid with respect to our intellectual property development. Similarly, a tax authority could assert that we are subject to tax in a jurisdiction where we believe we have not established a taxable nexus, often referred to as a \u201cpermanent establishment\u201d under international tax treaties, and such an assertion, if successful, could increase our expected tax liability in one or more jurisdictions. A tax authority may take the position that material income tax liabilities, interest and penalties are payable by us, in which case, we expect that we might contest such assessment. Contesting such an assessment may be lengthy and costly and if we were unsuccessful in disputing the assessment, the implications could increase our anticipated effective tax rate, where applicable.\nWe expect to be characterized as a passive foreign investment company for the taxable years ending December 31, 2020 and, as such, our U.S. shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences.\nGenerally, if for any taxable year 75% or more of our gross income is passive income, or at least 50% of our assets are held for the production of, or produce, passive income, we would be characterized as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For the taxable year ending December 31, 2020, we believe that we were a PFIC. If the Merger is not completed, we also expect to be classified as a PFIC for 2021. Furthermore, because PFIC status is determined annually and is based on our income, assets and activities for the entire taxable year, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether we will be characterized as a PFIC for the 2021 taxable year until after the close of the year, and there can be no assurance that we will not be classified as a PFIC in any future year. If we were to be characterized as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder owns ordinary shares, such U.S. Holder could face adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, including having gains realized on the sale of our ordinary shares classified as ordinary income, rather than as capital gain, the loss of the preferential rate applicable to dividends received on our ordinary shares by individuals who are U.S. Holders, and having interest charges apply to distributions by us and the proceeds of share sales. Certain elections exist that may alleviate some adverse consequences of PFIC status and would result in an alternative treatment (such as \u201cqualified electing fund\u201d and \u201cmark-to-market\u201d treatment) of our ordinary shares. Upon request, we expect to provide the information necessary for U.S. Holders to make \u201cqualified electing fund elections\u201d if we are classified as a PFIC. Each investor is urged to consult its tax advisor with respect to the application of the PFIC rules.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of our ordinary shares that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is or is treated as any of the following: (a) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (b) a corporation, or entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia; (c) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or (d) a trust that (1) is subject to the supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more \u201cUnited States persons\u201d (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), or (2) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nU.S. persons who own 10% or more of our ordinary shares may be subject to adverse U.S. tax consequences under the U.S. controlled foreign corporation rules.\nIf we are or become a controlled foreign corporation, or \u201cCFC,\u201d \u201c10% U.S. Shareholders\u201d (as defined below) may be taxed on their pro rata share of certain of our earnings, even if those earnings are not distributed by us. A non-U.S. corporation is a \u201cCFC\u201d if more than 50% of its shares (by vote or value) are owned by \u201c10% U.S. Shareholders.\u201d A U.S. person is a \u201c10% U.S. Shareholder\u201d if such person owns (directly, indirectly and/or constructively) 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of shares entitled to vote of such corporation or 10% or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of such corporation.\nIn general, if a U.S. person sells or exchanges stock in a foreign corporation and such person is a \u201c10% U.S. Shareholder\u201d at any time during the 5-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange when such foreign corporation was a CFC, any gain from such sale or exchange may be treated as a dividend to the extent of the corporation\u2019s earnings and profits attributable to such shares that were accumulated during the period that the shareholder held the shares while the corporation was a CFC (with certain adjustments).\nThe CFC rules are complex. The foregoing is merely a summary of certain potential applications of these rules. No assurances can be given that we are not or will not become a CFC, and certain changes to the CFC constructive ownership rules introduced by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could, under certain circumstances, cause us to be classified as a CFC. Each investor is urged to consult its tax advisor with respect to the possible application of the CFC rules.\nYour percentage ownership in us may be diluted by future issuances of share capital, which could reduce your influence over matters on which shareholders vote.\nOur board of directors has the authority, in most cases without action or vote of our shareholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares, including ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and options. Issuances of additional shares would reduce your influence over matters on which our shareholders vote.\nThe sale of a substantial number of our ordinary shares may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of ordinary shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline. We had 4,502,578 ordinary shares outstanding as of March 1, 2021. All of our ordinary shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020 are freely tradable, without restriction, in the public market in the United States. Any sales of our ordinary shares or any perception in the market that such sales may occur could cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline.\nIn addition, as of March 1, 2021, up to 908,601 ordinary shares are issuable upon exercise of outstanding registered warrants. Furthermore, as of March 1, 2021 and up to 444,107 ordinary shares that are subject to outstanding options and reserved options for future issuance under our 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2015 Plan, will be eligible for sale in the public market. We have filed registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register such ordinary shares under the 2015 Plan.\nIf these additional ordinary shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline.\nRaising additional capital would cause dilution to our existing shareholders, and may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, \u201cat-the-market\u201d issuances, equity-linked and structured transactions, debt (straight, convertible, or otherwise) financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a shareholder. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic alliance and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. Depending upon market liquidity at the time, additional sales of shares registered at any given time could cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline.\nBecause our ordinary shares may be, or become, a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d it may be more difficult for investors to sell their ordinary shares, and the market price of our ordinary shares may be adversely affected.\nOur ordinary shares may be, or become, a \u201cpenny stock\u201d if, among other things, the share price is below $5.00 per share, they are not listed on a national securities exchange or they have not met certain net tangible asset or average revenue requirements. Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks must provide purchasers of these stocks with a standardized risk-disclosure document prepared by the SEC. This document provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks involved in investing in the penny-stock market. A broker must also give a purchaser, orally or in writing, bid and offer quotations and information regarding broker and salesperson compensation, make a written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser, and obtain the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the purchase. Broker-dealers must also provide customers that hold penny stock in their accounts with such broker-dealer a monthly statement containing price and market information relating to the penny stock. If a penny stock is sold to an investor in violation of the penny stock rules, the investor may be able to cancel its purchase and get its money back.\nIf applicable, the penny stock rules may make it difficult for investors to sell their ordinary shares. Because of the rules and restrictions applicable to a penny stock, there is less trading in penny stocks and the market price of our ordinary shares may be adversely affected. Also, many brokers choose not to participate in penny stock transactions. Accordingly, investors may not always be able to resell their ordinary shares publicly at times and prices that they feel are appropriate and the market price of our ordinary shares may be adversely affected.\nWe must meet the Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s continued listing requirements and comply with the other Nasdaq rules, or we may risk delisting. Delisting could negatively affect the price of our ordinary shares, which could make it more difficult for us to sell securities in a financing and for you to sell your ordinary shares.\nWe are required to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market and comply with the other Nasdaq rules, including those regarding director independence and independent committee requirements, minimum shareholders\u2019 equity, minimum share price and certain other corporate governance requirements. If we do not meet these continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our ordinary shares may be delisted and the price of our ordinary shares and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted. On September 3, 2019, we were notified by Nasdaq that we were not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. The notification provided that we had 180 calendar days, or until March 2, 2020, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). On March 3, 2020, we were notified by Nasdaq that we are eligible for an additional 180 calendar day period, or until August 31, 2020, to regain compliance. On April 17, 2020, we were notified by Nasdaq that as a result of tolling of compliance periods by Nasdaq, our term to regain compliance was extended until November 13, 2020. Following a 1-for-20 reverse share split of our ordinary shares which was effective for Nasdaq marketplace purposes at the open of business on October 30, 2020, we regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. In any event, other factors unrelated to the number of ordinary shares outstanding, such as negative financial or operational results, could adversely affect the market price of our ordinary share to fall below the minimum $1.00 bid price again and could result in a delisting of our ordinary shares. Delisting of our ordinary shares from the Nasdaq Capital Market would cause us to pursue eligibility for trading on other markets or exchanges, or on the pink sheets. In such case, our shareholders\u2019 ability to trade, or obtain quotations of the market value of, our ordinary shares would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities. There can be no assurance that our ordinary shares, if delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market in the future, would be listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on a national quotation service, the OTCQB or OTC Pink. Delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market, or even the issuance of a notice of potential delisting, would also result in negative publicity, make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital, adversely affect the market liquidity of our ordinary shares, reduce security analysts\u2019 coverage of us and diminish investor, supplier and employee confidence. In addition, as a consequence of any such delisting, our share price could be negatively affected and our shareholders would likely find it more difficult to sell, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the prices of, our ordinary shares.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of the listing of our ordinary shares for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market and thereby being a public company in the United States, and our management is required to devote substantial additional time to new compliance initiatives as well as to compliance with ongoing U.S. reporting requirements.\nAs a public company in the U.S., we incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses in order to comply with requirements of the SEC, and the Nasdaq Capital Market, including requirements under Section 404 and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs, introduced new costs such as investor relations, stock exchange listing fees and shareholder reporting, and made some activities more time consuming and costly. Any future changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies in the United States, including Section 404 and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC and the Nasdaq Capital Market, for so long as they apply to us, will result in increased costs to us as we respond to such changes.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition. In addition, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our ordinary shares.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. We are required to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. Disclosing deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal controls, failing to remediate these deficiencies or weaknesses in a timely fashion or failing to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our ordinary shares. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our operating results could be harmed.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to such companies, our ordinary shares may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are a smaller reporting company, (i.e. a company with \u201cpublic float\u201d held by non-affiliates with a market value of less than $250 million) and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies. We have elected to adopt these reduced disclosure requirements. We cannot predict if investors will find our ordinary shares less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions. If some investors find our ordinary shares less attractive as a result of our choices, there may be a less active trading market for our ordinary shares and our stock price may be more volatile.\nRisks Related to Our Operations in Israel\nPotential political, economic and military instability in the State of Israel, where some of our senior management, our head executive office, research and development, and manufacturing facilities are located, may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur head executive office, our research and development facilities, our current manufacturing facility, as well as some of our clinical sites are located in Israel. Some of our officers and directors are residents of Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel and the surrounding region may directly affect our business and operations. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its neighboring countries, as well as terrorist acts committed within Israel by hostile elements. Any hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners could adversely affect our operations and results of operations. During November 2012 and from July through August 2014, Israel was engaged in an armed conflict with a militia group and political party who controls the Gaza Strip, and during the summer of 2006, Israel was engaged in an armed conflict with Hezbollah, a Lebanese Islamist Shiite militia group and political party. In December 2008 and January 2009 there was an escalation in violence among Israel, Hamas, the Palestinian Authority and other groups, as well as extensive hostilities along Israel\u2019s border with the Gaza Strip, which resulted in missiles being fired from the Gaza Strip into Southern Israel. Similar hostilities accompanied by missiles being fired from the Gaza Strip into Southern Israel, as well at areas more centrally located near Tel Aviv and at areas surrounding Jerusalem, occurred during November 2012 and July through August 2014. These conflicts involved missile strikes against civilian targets in various parts of Israel, including areas in which our employees and some of our consultants are located, and negatively affected business conditions in Israel.\nSince February 2011, Egypt has experienced political turbulence and an increase in terrorist activity in the Sinai Peninsula following the resignation of Hosni Mubarak as president. This included protests throughout Egypt, and the appointment of a military regime in his stead, followed by the elections to parliament which brought groups affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood (which had been previously outlawed by Egypt), and the subsequent overthrow of this elected government by a military regime. Such political turbulence and violence may damage peaceful and diplomatic relations between Israel and Egypt, and could affect the region as a whole. Similar civil unrest and political turbulence has occurred in other countries in the region, including Syria which shares a common border with Israel, and is affecting the political stability of those countries. Since April 2011, internal conflict in Syria has escalated, and evidence indicates that chemical weapons have been used in the region. Intervention may be contemplated by outside parties in order to prevent further chemical weapon use. This instability and any intervention may lead to deterioration of the political and economic relationships that exist between the State of Israel and some of these countries, and may have the potential for additional conflicts in the region. In addition, Iran has threatened to attack Israel and may be developing nuclear weapons. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence among extremist groups in the region, such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and various rebel militia groups in Syria. These situations may potentially escalate in the future to more violent events which may affect Israel and us. Any armed conflicts, terrorist activities or political instability in the region could adversely affect business conditions and could harm our results of operations and could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. Parties with whom we do business have sometimes declined to travel to Israel during periods of heightened unrest or tension, forcing us to make alternative arrangements when necessary in order to meet our business partners face to face. In addition, the political and security situation in Israel may result in parties with whom we have agreements involving performance in Israel claiming that they are not obligated to perform their commitments under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions in such agreements.\nOur commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with the security situation in the Middle East. Although the Israeli government currently covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot assure you that this government coverage will be maintained or that it will sufficiently cover our potential damages. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any armed conflicts or political instability in the region would likely negatively affect business conditions and could harm our results of operations.\nFurther, in the past, the State of Israel and Israeli companies have been subjected to economic boycotts. Several countries still restrict business with the State of Israel and with Israeli companies. These restrictive laws and policies may have an adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition or the expansion of our business. A campaign of boycotts, divestment and sanctions has been undertaken against Israel, which could also adversely impact our business.\nThe legislative power of the State resides in the Knesset, a unicameral parliament that consists of 120 members elected by nationwide voting under a system of proportional representation. Israel\u2019s most recent general elections were held on April 9, 2019, September 17, 2019 and March 2, 2020, following which a process of composing and approving a new government has commenced. This uncertainty surrounding future elections and/or the results of such elections in Israel may continue and the political situation in Israel may further deteriorate. Actual or perceived political instability in Israel or any negative changes in the political environment, may individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Israeli economy and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur operations may be disrupted as a result of the obligation of Israeli citizens to perform military service.\nMany Israeli citizens are obligated to perform up to 36 days, and in some cases more, of annual military reserve duty each year until they reach the age of 40 (or older, for reservists who are military officers or who have certain occupations) and, in the event of a military conflict, may be called to active duty. In response to increases in terrorist activity, there have been periods of significant call-ups of military reservists. It is possible that there will be military reserve duty call-ups in the future. Our operations could be disrupted by such call-ups, which may include the call-up of members of our management. Such disruption could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInvestors may have difficulties enforcing a U.S. judgment, including judgments based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us, or our executive officers and directors or asserting U.S. securities laws claims in Israel.\nNot all of our directors or officers are residents of the United States. Most of our assets and those of our non-U.S. directors and officers are located outside the United States. Service of process upon us or our non-U.S. resident directors and officers and enforcement of judgments obtained in the United States against us or our non-U.S. directors and executive officers may be difficult to obtain within the United States. We have been informed by our legal counsel in Israel that it may be difficult to assert claims under U.S. securities laws in original actions instituted in Israel or obtain a judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws against us or our non-U.S. officers and directors because Israel may not be the most appropriate forum to bring such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law and not U.S. law is applicable to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law. There is little binding case law in Israel addressing the matters described above. Israeli courts might not enforce judgments rendered outside Israel, which may make it difficult to collect on judgments rendered against us or our non-U.S. officers and directors.\nMoreover, among other reasons, including but not limited to, fraud or absence of due process, or the existence of a judgment which is at variance with another judgment that was given in the same matter if a suit in the same matter between the same parties was pending before a court or tribunal in Israel, an Israeli court will not enforce a foreign judgment if it was given in a state whose laws do not provide for the enforcement of judgments of Israeli courts (subject to exceptional cases) or if its enforcement is likely to prejudice the sovereignty or security of the State of Israel.\nUnder current Israeli law, we may not be able to enforce employees\u2019 covenants not to compete and therefore may be unable to prevent our competitors from benefiting from the expertise of some of our former employees.\nWe generally enter into non-competition agreements with our key employees, in most cases within the framework of their employment agreements. These agreements prohibit our key employees, if they cease working for us, from competing directly with us or working for our competitors for a limited period. Under applicable Israeli law, we may be unable to enforce these agreements or any part thereof. If we cannot enforce our non-competition agreements with our employees, then we may be unable to prevent our competitors from benefiting from the expertise of our former employees, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and ability to capitalize on our proprietary information.\nYour rights and responsibilities as our shareholder will be governed by Israeli law, which may differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders of U.S. corporations.\nWe are incorporated under Israeli law. The rights and responsibilities of holders of our ordinary shares are governed by our articles of association and the Companies Law. These rights and responsibilities differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders in typical U.S. corporations. In particular, pursuant to the Companies Law, each shareholder of an Israeli company has to act in good faith in exercising his or her rights and fulfilling his or her obligations toward the Company and other shareholders and to refrain from abusing his or her power in the Company, including, among other things, in voting at the general meeting of shareholders and class meetings, on amendments to a company\u2019s articles of association, increases in a company\u2019s authorized share capital, mergers, and transactions requiring shareholders\u2019 approval under the Companies Law. In addition, a controlling shareholder of an Israeli company or a shareholder who knows that it possesses the power to determine the outcome of a shareholder vote or who has the power to appoint or prevent the appointment of a director or officer in the Company, or has other powers toward the Company has a duty of fairness toward the Company. However, Israeli law does not define the substance of this duty of fairness. There is little case law available to assist in understanding the implications of these provisions that govern shareholder behavior.\nProvisions of Israeli law and our articles of association may delay, prevent or make undesirable an acquisition of all or a significant portion of our shares or assets.\nCertain provisions of Israeli law and our articles of association could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or for our shareholders to elect different individuals to our board of directors, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders, and may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for our ordinary shares. For example, Israeli corporate law regulates mergers and requires that a tender offer be effected when more than a specified percentage of shares in a company are purchased. Further, Israeli tax considerations may make potential transactions undesirable to us or to some of our shareholders whose country of residence does not have a tax treaty with Israel granting tax relief to such shareholders from Israeli tax. With respect to certain mergers, Israeli tax law may impose certain restrictions on future transactions, including with respect to dispositions of shares received as consideration, for a period of two years from the date of the merger.\nFurthermore, under the Encouragement of Research, Development and Technological Innovation in the Industry Law 5744-1984 and the regulations guidelines, rules, procedures and benefit tracks thereunder, or the Innovation Law, to which we are subject due to our receipt of grants from the Israel Innovation Authority, or IIA (formerly known as the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of Economy and Industry, or the OCS), a recipient of IIA grants such as us must report to IIA regarding any change of control or any change in the holding of its means of control of our Company which transforms any non-Israeli citizen or resident into an \u201cinterested party\u201d, as defined in the Israeli Securities Law 5728-1968, or the Israeli Securities Law, and in the latter event, the non-Israeli citizen or resident shall execute an undertaking in favor of IIA, in a form prescribed by IIA.\nWe have received Israeli government grants for certain of our research and development activities. The terms of these grants may require us to satisfy specified conditions in order to manufacture products and transfer technologies outside of Israel. We may be required to pay penalties in addition to the repayment of the grants. Such grants may be terminated or reduced in the future, which would increase our costs.\nUnder the Innovation Law, research and development programs that meet specified criteria and are approved by a committee of the IIA are eligible for grants. The grants awarded are typically up to 50% of the project\u2019s expenditures, as determined by the IIA committee and subject to the benefit track under which the grant was awarded. A company that receives a grant from the IIA, or a Participating Company, is typically required to pay royalties to IIA on income generated from products incorporating know-how developed using such grants (including income derived from services associated with such products), until 100% of the U.S. dollar-linked grant plus annual LIBOR interest (or any other interest rate that the IIA may choose to apply in the future) is repaid. The rate of royalties to be paid may vary between different benefits tracks, as shall be determined by IIA. In general, the rate of royalties varies between 3% to 5% of the income generated from the IIA supported products.\nThe obligation to pay royalties is contingent on actual income generated from such products and services. In the absence of such income, no payment of royalties is required. It should be noted that the restrictions under the Innovation Law will continue to apply even after the repayment of such royalties in full by the Participating Company, including restrictions on the sale, transfer or assignment outside of Israel of know-how developed as part of the programs under which the grants were given.\nThe terms of the grants under the Innovation Law also (generally) require that the products developed as part of the programs under which the grants were given be manufactured in Israel and that the know-how developed thereunder may not be transferred outside of Israel, unless prior written approval is received from the IIA (such approval is not required for the transfer of a portion of the manufacturing capacity which does not exceed, in the aggregate, 10% of the portion declared to be manufactured outside of Israel in the applications for funding (in which case only notification is required), and additional payments are required to be made to IIA, as described below. It should be noted that this does not restrict the export of products that incorporate the funded know-how.\nOrdinarily, as a condition to obtaining approval to manufacture outside Israel, we may be required to pay royalties at an increased rate and up to an increased cap amount of three times the total amount of the IIA grants, plus interest accrued thereon, depending on the manufacturing volume to be performed outside Israel. The IIA approved our request to transfer 100% of the manufacturing rights of our AP-CD/LD product candidate that was developed under the IIA funded program to a non-Israeli manufacturer. As a result, we will be required to pay the IIA royalties from revenue generated from the AP-CD/LD product candidate at an increased rate, and up to an increased cap amount. The IIA noted that the approval granted was exceptional and that the IIA will not approve manufacturing of additional product candidates out of Israel.\nThe Innovation Law restricts the ability to transfer know-how funded by IIA outside of Israel. Transfer of IIA-funded know-how outside of Israel requires prior approval of the IIA and is subject to payment of a redemption fee to the IIA calculated according to a formula provided under the Innovation Law. A transfer for the purpose of the Innovation Law is generally interpreted very broadly and includes, inter alia, any actual sale of the IIA-funded know-how, any license to develop the IIA-funded know-how or the products resulting from such IIA-funded know-how or any other transaction, which, in essence, constitutes a transfer of the IIA-funded know-how. Generally, a mere license solely to market products resulting from the IIA-funded know-how would not be deemed a transfer for the purpose of the Innovation Law.\nThe IIA approval to transfer know-how created, in whole or in part, in connection with an IIA-funded project, to a third party outside Israel, is subject to payment of a redemption fee to IIA calculated according to a formula provided under the Innovation Law that is based, in general, on the ratio between the aggregate IIA grants received by the company (including the accrued interest) and the company\u2019s aggregate investments in the project that was funded by these IIA grants, multiplied by the transaction consideration (taking into account any depreciation in accordance with a formula set forth in the Innovation Law) less any royalties already paid to the IIA. The Innovation Law establishes a maximum payment amount of the redemption fee paid to the IIA under the above mentioned formulas and differentiates between two situations: (i) in the event that the company sells its IIA-funded know-how, in whole or in part, or is sold as part of certain merger and acquisition transactions, and subsequently ceases to conduct business in Israel, the maximum redemption fee under the above mentioned formulas shall be no more than six times the amount of grants received (plus accrued interest) for the applicable know-how being transferred; and (ii) in the event that following the transactions described above (i.e., asset sale of IIA-funded know-how or transfer as part of certain merger and acquisition transactions), the company continues to conduct its research activity in Israel (for at least three years following such transfer, keeps on staff at least 75% of the number of research and development employees it had for the six months before the know-how was transferred and keeps the same scope of employment of such research and development staff), then the company is eligible for a reduced cap of the redemption fee of no more than three times the amounts of grants received (plus accrued interest) for the applicable know-how being transferred. The obligation to pay royalties mentioned above will no longer apply following the payment of the redemption fee, as described above.\nSubject to prior approval of the IIA, the Company may transfer the IIA-funded know-how to another Israeli company. If the IIA-funded know-how is transferred to another Israeli entity, the transfer would still require IIA approval but will not be subject to the payment of the redemption fee (although there will be an obligation to pay royalties to the IIA from the income of such sale transaction as part of the royalty payment obligation). In such case, the acquiring company would have to assume all of the selling company\u2019s restrictions and obligations towards the IIA (including the restrictions on the transfer of know-how and manufacturing capacity outside of Israel) as a condition to IIA approval.\nOur research and development efforts have been financed, partially, through grants that we have received from the IIA. We therefore must comply with the requirements of the Innovation Law and related regulations. As of December 31, 2020, we received approximately NIS 42.3 million of such grants for research and development programs in the years 2009 through 2016. We did not apply for any grants from the IIA since January 1, 2017. For more information see note 6c in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Innovation Law restricts the ability to transfer know-how funded by the IIA outside of Israel. Transfer of IIA-funded know-how outside of Israel requires the prior approval of the IIA and, under certain circumstances, is subject to significant payments to IIA (calculated according to a formula set forth under the Innovation Law), as further described above. Therefore, the discretionary approval of an IIA committee will be required for any transfer to third parties outside of Israel of rights related to our Accordion Pill, which has been developed with IIA-funding. The restrictions under the Innovation Law may impair our ability to enter into agreements which involve IIA-funded products or know-how without the approval of IIA. We cannot be certain that any approval of IIA will be obtained on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We may not receive the required approvals should we wish to transfer IIA-funded know-how, manufacturing and/or development outside of Israel in the future. Furthermore, in the event that we undertake a transaction involving the transfer to a non-Israeli entity of know-how developed with IIA-funding pursuant to a merger or similar transaction, the consideration available to our shareholders may be reduced by the amounts we are required to pay to IIA. Any approval, if given, will generally be subject to additional financial obligations. Failure to comply with the requirements under the Innovation Law may subject us to mandatory repayment of grants received by us (together with interest and penalties), as well as expose us to criminal proceedings. In addition, IIA may from time to time conduct royalties audits and such audits may lead to additional royalties being payable on additional products. Such grants may be terminated or reduced in the future, which would increase our costs. IIA approval is not required for the marketing of products resulting from the IIA-funded research or development in the ordinary course of business.", "PERMNO": 15642, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "NTEC"}
