{"cik": "1611988", "company": "Fifth Street Asset Management Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to a number of significant risks inherent in our business. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the events described below occur, our business and financial results could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our Class A Common Stock could decline as a result of any of these risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Economic Conditions\nEconomic recessions or downturns may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEconomic recessions or downturns may result in a prolonged period of market illiquidity which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions also could increase the funding costs of our funds, limit access to the capital markets of our funds or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us or our funds. An economic decline could also negatively impact the private equity sponsors with whom we partner, leading to decreased origination opportunities and potentially less favorable economic terms for our funds in connection with our direct originations. These events could limit investment originations by the Fifth Street Funds, limit our\nability to grow the Fifth Street Funds and negatively impact our operating results.\nIn addition, to the extent that recessionary conditions return, the financial results of small and mid-sized companies, like those in which our funds invest, will likely experience deterioration, which could ultimately lead to difficulty in meeting debt service requirements and an increase in defaults. Additionally, the end markets for certain of the products and services of the portfolio companies of our funds would likely experience negative economic trends. The performance of certain of the portfolio companies of our funds have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by these economic or other conditions, which may ultimately result in our receipt of a reduced level of interest income from the portfolio companies of our funds and/or losses or charge offs related to such investments, and, in turn, may materially adversely affect the fees we receive from our funds. Further, adverse economic conditions may decrease the value of collateral securing some of the loans, including the first lien loans, and the value of equity investments held by our funds. As a result, the Fifth Street Funds may need to modify the payment terms of their investments, including changes in payment-in-kind interest provisions and/or cash interest rates. These factors may result in the receipt of a reduced level of interest income from our funds' portfolio companies and/or losses or charge offs related to their investments, and, in turn, may adversely affect the fees that we receive and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFurther downgrades of the U.S. credit rating, impending automatic spending cuts or a government shutdown could negatively impact our liquidity, financial condition and earnings.\nRecent U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of additional credit rating downgrades and economic slowdowns, or a recession in the United States. Although U.S. lawmakers passed legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling on multiple occasions, ratings agencies have lowered or threatened to lower the long-term sovereign credit rating on the United States. The impact of this or any further downgrades to the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating or its perceived creditworthiness could adversely affect the United States and global financial markets and economic conditions. While the U.S. Federal Reserve ended its quantitative easing program, but reiterated its plans to maintain the federal funds rate at historically low levels for the immediate term, interest rates and borrowing costs could begin to rise, which may negatively impact our ability or the ability of the Fifth Street Funds to access the debt markets on favorable terms. In addition, disagreement over the federal budget has caused the U.S. federal government to essentially shut down for periods of time. Continued adverse political and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGlobal economic, political and market conditions and economic uncertainty may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability.\nThe current worldwide financial market situation, as well as various social and political tensions in the United States and around the world, may continue to contribute to increased market volatility, may have long-term effects on the United States and worldwide financial markets, and may cause further economic uncertainties or deterioration in the United States and worldwide. Economic uncertainty can have a negative impact on our business through changing spreads, structures and purchase multiples, as well as the overall supply of investment capital. Since 2010, several European Union, or EU, countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and Portugal, have faced budget issues, some of which may have negative long-term effects for the economies of those countries and other EU countries. There is continued concern about national-level support for the Euro and the accompanying coordination of fiscal and wage policy among European Economic and Monetary Union member countries. In addition, the fiscal policy of foreign nations, such as China, may have a severe impact on the worldwide and United States financial markets. We do not know how long the financial markets will continue to be affected by these events and cannot predict the effects of these or similar events in the future on the United States economy and securities markets or on our investments. As a result of these factors, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully monitor developments and manage the investments of our funds in a manner consistent with achieving their investment objectives.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to raise capital from investors. If we are unable to raise capital from new or existing investors or existing investors decide to withdraw their investments from our funds, the Fifth Street Funds will be unable to deploy such capital into investments and we will be unable to collect additional management fees, which would have a negative effect on our growth prospects.\nOur ability to raise capital from investors depends on a number of factors, including many that are outside our control. Investors may choose not to make investments with alternative asset managers, including BDCs, private funds and hedge funds, and may choose to invest in asset classes and fund strategies that we do not offer. Poor performance of our funds could also make it more difficult for us to raise new capital. Our investors and potential investors continually assess the performance of these funds independently and relative to market benchmarks and our competitors, and our ability to raise capital for existing\nand future funds depends on our performance. If economic and market conditions deteriorate, we may be unable to raise sufficient amounts of capital to support the investment activities of our new and future strategies and funds. In addition, one of our key growth strategies is the expansion of our product offerings through the development of new and future strategies and funds. If we are unable to successfully raise capital for our existing and future funds, we will be unable to collect additional management fees, which would have a negative effect on our growth prospects.\nIn addition, certain of our newer strategies permit investors to withdraw their investments from our funds and could be affected by portfolio rebalancing. This could have the effect of decreasing the capital available for investments in our funds and reduce our revenues and cash flows. As of December 31, 2014, these non-permanent capital strategies constituted 10% of our fee-earning AUM. We expect that the AUM of our non-permanent capital vehicles will increase, in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total AUM over time.\nThe loss of our executive officers, key investment professionals or senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our ability to attract and retain qualified investment professionals is critical to our success.\nWe depend on the investment expertise, skill and network of business contacts of our executive officers, key investment professionals and senior management team. Our executive officers, key investment professionals and senior management team evaluate, negotiate, structure, execute, monitor and service our funds' investments. Our future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued service and coordination of our executive officers, key investment professionals and senior management team. The departure of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our funds' investment objectives.\nThe ability of the Fifth Street Funds to achieve their investment objectives depends on our ability to identify, analyze, invest in, finance and monitor companies that meet their investment criteria. Our capabilities in structuring the investment process, providing competent, attentive and efficient services to our funds, and facilitating access to financing on acceptable terms depend on the employment of investment professionals in adequate number and of adequate sophistication to match the corresponding flow of transactions. To achieve the investment and growth objectives of the Fifth Street Funds, we may, through our affiliates, need to hire, train, supervise and manage new investment professionals to participate in our investment selection and monitoring process. We may not be able to find investment professionals in a timely manner or at all. We also face competition from other industry participants for the services of qualified investment professionals, both with respect to hiring new and retaining current investment professionals. Failure to support our investment process could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. We do not carry any \"key man\" insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of our executive officers, key investment professionals or senior management team.\nOur business model depends to a significant extent upon strong referral relationships with private equity sponsors, and the inability of our executive officers, key investment professionals and senior management team to maintain or develop these relationships, or the failure of these relationships to generate investment opportunities, could adversely affect our business.\nWe expect that certain of our executive officers, key investment professionals and senior management team will maintain and develop our relationships with private equity sponsors, and our funds will rely to a significant extent upon these relationships to provide them with potential investment opportunities. Certain key private equity sponsors regularly provide us with access to their transactions. If such persons fail to maintain their existing relationships or develop new relationships with other sponsors or sources of investment opportunities, we may not be able to grow the investment portfolios of the Fifth Street Funds. In addition, individuals with whom such persons have relationships are not obligated to provide us with investment opportunities, and, therefore, there is no assurance that such relationships will generate investment opportunities for the Fifth Street Funds.\nThe investment management business is intensely competitive.\nThe investment management business is intensely competitive, with competition based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, continuity of investment professionals and client relationships, the quality of services provided to clients, corporate positioning and business reputation and continuity of selling arrangements with intermediaries and differentiated products. A number of factors, including the following, serve to increase our competitive risks:\n\u2022\na number of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, including a lower cost of capital and better access to funding sources, more established name recognition and more personnel than we do;\n\u2022\nthere are relatively low barriers impeding entry to new investment funds, including a relatively low cost of entering these businesses;\n\u2022\nthere are an increasing number of BDCs and the size of BDCs has also been increasing;\n\u2022\nthe recent trend toward consolidation in the investment management industry, and the securities business in general, has served to increase the size and strength of our competitors;\n\u2022\nsome investors may prefer to invest with an investment manager that is not publicly-traded based on the perception that publicly-traded companies focus on growth to the detriment of performance;\n\u2022\nsome competitors may invest according to different investment styles or in alternative asset classes that the markets may perceive as more attractive than our investment approach;\n\u2022\nsome competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than we or our funds have; and\n\u2022\nother industry participants, hedge funds and alternative asset managers may seek to recruit our qualified investment professionals.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively, our earnings would be reduced and our business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Fifth Street Funds face increasing competition for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses at the Fifth Street Funds and reduce our revenues.\nThe Fifth Street Funds compete for investments with other BDCs and investment funds (including private equity funds and mezzanine funds), as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and other sources of funding. Several of our competitors are substantially larger and may have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we or our funds do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us or the Fifth Street Funds. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than we or our funds have. These characteristics could allow our competitors to consider a wider variety of investments, establish more relationships and offer better pricing and more flexible structuring than we are able to do for our funds. We may lose investment opportunities for our funds if we do not match our competitors' pricing, terms and structure. If we are forced to match our competitors' pricing, terms and/or structure, we may not be able to achieve acceptable returns on investments for the Fifth Street Funds or such investments may bear substantial risk of capital loss, particularly relative to the returns to be achieved. A significant part of our competitive advantage stems from the fact that the market for investments in small and mid-sized companies is underserved by traditional commercial banks and other financial sources. A significant increase in the number and/or the size of our competitors in this target market could force us to accept less attractive investment terms for the Fifth Street Funds. Recently, there has been an increase in the number and size of BDCs as part of the competitive landscape in our industry. Furthermore, some of our competitors have greater experience operating under, or are not subject to, the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on our two largest funds as BDCs.\nPoor performance of our funds would cause a decline in our revenues and results of operations and could materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future funds.\nWe derive revenues primarily from management fees from the BDCs and funds we manage. When any of our funds perform poorly, either by incurring losses or underperforming benchmarks, as compared to our competitors or otherwise, our investment record suffers. As a result, our revenues may be adversely affected and the value of our assets under management could decrease, which may, in turn, reduce our management fees. Moreover, we may experience losses on investments of our own capital as a result of poor investment performance, including investments in our own funds. If a fund performs poorly, we may receive little or no incentive fees with regard to the fund and little income or possibly losses from our own principal investment in such fund. Poor performance of our funds could also make it more difficult for us to raise new capital. Investors in our closed-end funds may decline to invest in future closed-end funds we raise as a result of poor performance. Investors and potential investors in our funds continually assess performance of our funds independently and relative to market benchmarks and our competitors, and our ability to raise capital for existing and future funds and avoid excessive redemption levels depends on our funds' performance. Accordingly, poor performance may deter future investment in our funds and thereby decrease the capital invested in our funds and, ultimately, our revenues. Alternatively, in the face of poor fund performance, investors could demand lower fees or fee concessions for existing or future funds which would likewise decrease our revenues.\nManagement fees received from the Fifth Street BDCs comprise a significant portion of our revenues and a reduction in such fees, including from the termination of investment advisory agreements, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, the revenues generated from FSC and FSFR were approximately 99%, of our revenues (including 38% attributable to Part I Fees). The investment advisory agreements Fifth Street Management has with each of the Fifth Street BDCs categorizes the fees we receive, with respect to each BDC, as: (a) base management fees, which are paid quarterly and generally increase or decrease based on such BDC's total assets, (b) Part I Fees, which are paid quarterly, and (c) Part II Fees, which are paid annually. We classify the Part I Fees as management fees because they are paid quarterly, are predictable and recurring in nature, are not subject to repayment (or clawback) and are generally cash-settled each quarter.\nPart I Fees, however, are subject to certain specified performance hurdles and, if we do not meet the specified performance hurdles, the amount of fees paid to us would decrease. If the total assets or net investment income of FSC or FSFR were to decline significantly for any reason, including without limitation, due to short-term changes in market value, mark-to-market accounting requirements, the poor performance of its investments or the failure to successfully access or invest capital, the amount of the fees we receive from these BDCs, including management fees, would also decline significantly, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. In addition, because the Part II Fees are not paid unless such BDC achieves cumulative realized capital gains (net of realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation), Part II Fees payable to us are variable and not predictable.\nFees paid to us by the Fifth Street BDCs could vary quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including such BDC's ability or inability to make investments in companies that meet its investment criteria, the interest rate payable on the debt securities it acquires, the level of its expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which it encounters competition in our market, its ability to fund investments and general economic conditions. Variability in revenues received from the Fifth Street BDCs could have an adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations and could cause volatility or a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, the investment advisory agreements with FSC and FSFR may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days' written notice to the other. If either of these agreements were terminated, we would experience a significant decline in revenues and profitability.\nThe historical returns attributable to our funds should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds, our new investment strategies, our operations or of any returns expected on an investment in our Class A common stock.\nWe have presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K the returns relating to the historical performance of our funds. The returns are relevant to us primarily insofar as they are indicative of revenues we have earned in the past and may earn in the future, our reputation and our ability to raise new funds. The returns of the funds we manage are not, however, directly linked to returns on our Class A common stock. Therefore, you should not conclude that continued positive performance of the funds we manage will necessarily result in positive returns on an investment in our Class A common stock. However, poor performance of the funds we manage may cause a decline in our revenue from such funds, and would therefore have a negative effect on our performance and the value of our Class A common stock. An investment in our Class A common stock is not an investment in any of the Fifth Street funds. Moreover, the historical returns of our funds should not be considered indicative of the future returns of these or from any future funds we may raise, in part because our funds' returns have benefited from investment opportunities and general market conditions that may not repeat themselves, including the availability of debt capital on attractive terms, and there can be no assurance that our current or future funds will be able to avail themselves of profitable investment opportunities.\nIn addition, the IRR and total return going forward for any current or future fund may vary considerably from the historical IRR and total return generated by any particular fund, or for our BDCs as a whole. Future returns will also be affected by the risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including risks of the industries and businesses in which a particular fund invests.\nThe significant growth we have experienced, particularly with respect to assets under management and revenues, will be difficult to sustain.\nOur AUM increased from approximately $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2010 to approximately $6.3 billion as of December 31, 2014. Our management fee revenues have increased from approximately $24.8 million (including Part I Fees of $12.2 million) for the year ended December 31, 2010 to approximately $95.4 million (including Part I Fees of $39.3 million) for the year ended December 31, 2014. This significant growth will be difficult to sustain. The continued growth of our business will depend on, among other things, our ability to devote sufficient resources to maintaining existing investment strategies and developing new investment strategies and funds, maintain and further develop relationships with private equity sponsors and other sources of investment opportunities, our success in producing attractive returns from our investment strategies, our ability to extend our distribution capabilities, our ability to deal with changing market conditions, our ability to maintain adequate financial and business controls and our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements arising in response to the increased sophistication of the investment management market. In addition, we expect there to be significant demand on our infrastructure and investment team and we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage our growing business effectively or that we will be able to sustain the level of growth we have achieved historically, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and control our expenses.\nWe intend to enter into new lines of business and expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses.\nWe intend, if market conditions warrant, to grow by increasing AUM in existing businesses and expanding into new\ninvestment strategies, geographic markets and businesses. We may develop new strategies and funds organically through our existing platform. We may also pursue growth through acquisitions of other investment management companies, acquisitions of critical business partners or other strategic initiatives, which may include entering into new lines of business. In addition, consistent with our past experience, we expect opportunities will arise to acquire other alternative or traditional asset managers.\nAttempts to expand our businesses involve a number of special factors, including some or all of the following:\n\u2022\nthe required investment of capital and other resources;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management's attention from our core businesses;\n\u2022\nthe levels of experience of our executive officers, investment professionals and senior management in operating new investment strategies and funds;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of liabilities in any acquired business;\n\u2022\nunexpected difficulties or the incurrence of unexpected costs associated with integrating and overseeing the operations of new businesses and activities;\n\u2022\nentry into markets or lines of business in which we may have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\nincreasing demands on our operational and management systems and controls;\n\u2022\nnew investment strategies and funds may provide for less profitable fee structures and arrangements than our existing investment strategies and funds;\n\u2022\ncompliance with additional regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\nthe broadening of our geographic footprint, increasing the risks associated with conducting operations in certain foreign jurisdictions where we currently have no presence.\nEntry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. If a new business does not generate sufficient revenues or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations, our results of operations will be adversely affected. Our strategic initiatives includes joint ventures, in which case we are subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control. Further, as we expand existing and develop new funds that are not permanent capital vehicles, we may be subject to a greater risk of, among other things, investor redemptions and reallocation. Because we have not yet identified these potential new investment strategies, geographic markets or lines of business, we cannot identify for you all the risks we may face and the potential adverse consequences on us and your investment that may result from any attempted expansion. The risks described above, including those we cannot identify, may prevent us from growing our business through expanded product offerings or result in unexpected costs that may lead to a decline in our financial position and the market value of our Class A common stock.\nOperational risks may disrupt our business, result in losses or limit our growth.\nWe are heavily dependent on the capacity and reliability of the technology systems supporting our operations, whether owned and operated by us or by third parties. Operational risks such as trading errors or interruption of our financial, accounting, trading, compliance and other data processing systems, whether caused by fire, other natural disaster, power or telecommunications failure, cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents, act of terrorism or war or otherwise, could result in a disruption of our business, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. If any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled for any reason or if there is any unauthorized disclosure of data, whether as a result of tampering, a breach of our network security systems, a cyber-incident or attack or otherwise, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to our funds, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. Insurance and other safeguards might be unavailable or might only partially reimburse us for our losses. Although we have back-up systems in place, our back-up procedures and capabilities in the event of a failure or interruption may not be adequate.\nThe inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions also could constrain our ability to expand our businesses. Additionally, any upgrades or expansions to our operations or technology may require significant expenditures and may increase the probability that we will suffer system degradations and failures.\nThe failure in cyber-security systems, as well as the occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning could impair our ability to conduct business effectively.\nThe occurrence of a disaster such as a cyber-attack, a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a terrorist attack or war, events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems, or a support failure from external providers, could have an adverse\neffect on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if those events affect our computer-based data processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval systems or destroy data. If a significant number of our management employees or investment professionals were unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct our business could be severely compromised.\nWe depend heavily upon computer systems to perform necessary business functions. Despite our implementation of a variety of security measures, our computer systems could be subject to cyber-attacks and unauthorized access, such as physical and electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering. Like other companies, we may experience threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, system failures and disruptions. If one or more of these events occurs, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, which could result in damage to our reputation, financial losses, litigation, increased costs, regulatory penalties and/or customer dissatisfaction or loss.\nWe are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends.\nOur business is highly dependent on our and third parties' communications and information systems. Any failure or interruption of those systems, including as a result of the termination of an agreement with any third-party service providers, could cause delays or other problems in our activities. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control and adversely affect our business. There could be:\n\u2022\nsudden electrical or telecommunications outages;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes;\n\u2022\ndisease pandemics;\n\u2022\nevents arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and/or\n\u2022\ncyber-attacks.\nThese events, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the market price of our Class A common stock and our ability to pay dividends.\nEmployee misconduct could expose us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.\nWe are vulnerable to reputational harm, as we operate in an industry where integrity and the confidence of our clients are of critical importance. If an employee were to engage in illegal or suspicious activities, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation (as a consequence of the negative perception resulting from such activities), financial position, client relationships and ability to attract new clients. Our business often requires that we deal with confidential information. If our employees were to improperly use or disclose this information, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships.\nOur new investment strategies may expose us to additional employee misconduct risks, for example with respect to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and other anticorruption laws. While we may develop and implement policies and procedures designed to ensure strict compliance by us and our personnel with such potentially newly applicable regulations, including the FCPA, such policies and procedures may not be effective in all instances to prevent violations in the future. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA or other applicable anticorruption laws could subject us to significant penalties and negative effects on our business and operations.\nIt is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct by our employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business.\nIf our techniques for managing risk are ineffective, we may be exposed to material unanticipated losses.\nIn order to manage the significant risks inherent in our business, we must maintain effective policies, procedures and systems that enable us to identify, monitor and control our exposure to market, operational, legal and reputational risks. Our risk management methods may prove to be ineffective due to their design or implementation or as a result of the lack of adequate, accurate or timely information. If our risk management efforts are ineffective, we could suffer losses or face litigation, particularly from our clients, and sanctions or fines from regulators.\nOur techniques for managing risks in our funds may not fully mitigate the risk exposure in all economic or market\nenvironments, or against all types of risk, including risks that we might fail to identify or anticipate. Any failures in our risk management techniques and strategies to accurately quantify such risk exposure could limit our ability to manage risks in those funds or to seek positive, risk-adjusted returns. In addition, any risk management failures could cause fund losses to be significantly greater than historical measures predict. Our more qualitative approach to managing those risks could prove insufficient, exposing us to material unanticipated losses in the net asset value of the funds and therefore a reduction in our revenues.\nOur failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our business.\nAs we have expanded the scope of our business, we increasingly confront potential, perceived or actual conflicts of interest relating to our existing and future investment activities. For example, certain of our strategies have overlapping investment objectives, and potential conflicts of interest may arise with respect to our decisions regarding how to allocate investment opportunities among those strategies. In addition, investors (or holders of our Class A common stock) may perceive conflicts of interest regarding investment decisions for strategies in which our investment professionals, who have and may continue to make significant personal investments, are personally invested. It is possible that potential, perceived or actual conflicts of interest could give rise to investor dissatisfaction, litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. Adequately addressing conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and we could suffer significant reputational harm if we fail, or appear to fail, to adequately address potential, perceived or actual conflicts of interest. This could result in a loss of AUM and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, Fifth Street Management and certain of our affiliates have received an exemptive order from the SEC, on September 9, 2014 that permits certain negotiated co-investments among our affiliates that would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act. Such joint transactions among us and our affiliates may give rise to increased perceived or actual conflicts among investors in our funds.\nOur revolving credit facility may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to certain changes or to take future actions, and expose use to risks relating to the use of leverage.\nWe entered into a credit agreement for a revolving credit facility in November 2014, which contains a number of restrictive covenants. These covenants collectively impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. The financial covenants, among other things, impose limitations on waiving or deferring management fees from our funds, require us not to exceed a total leverage ratio, require us to maintain a minimum AUM and require us to maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio.\nOur ability to comply with these and other covenants is dependent upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control but could nonetheless result in noncompliance. For example, our leverage ratio fluctuates depending upon changes in revenues and expenses relative to our outstanding debt; our consolidated interest coverage ratio fluctuates depending upon changes in revenues and expenses relative to our interest payment obligations; and the value of our AUM fluctuates due to a variety of factors, including mark-to-market valuations of certain assets, other market factors and our net capital raised or returned.\nOur credit agreement also contains other covenants that restrict our operations and a number of events that would constitute an event of default under the agreement. A failure by us to comply with the covenants in our credit agreement could result in an event of default under the agreement, which could give the lenders under the agreement the right to terminate their commitments to provide additional loans under our revolving credit facility and to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If the debt under our credit agreement were accelerated, we might not have sufficient cash on hand to repay this debt, which could have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For more detail regarding our current credit agreement and the status of our compliance with the related covenants, please see \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Revolving Credit Facility.\u201d\nIn addition, our incurrence of debt under the revolving credit facility will expose us to the typical risks associated with the use of leverage. Increased leverage makes it more difficult for us to withstand adverse economic conditions or business plan variances, to take advantage of new business opportunities or to make necessary capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2014, we had $12.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.\nA change of control could result in termination of certain of our investment advisory agreements.\nPursuant to the 1940 Act, each of the investment advisory agreements for the Fifth Street BDCs automatically terminates upon its deemed \"assignment\" and a BDC's board and shareholders must approve a new agreement in order for us to\ncontinue to act as its investment adviser. A sale of a controlling block of our voting securities and certain other transactions would be deemed an \"assignment\" pursuant to the 1940 Act. In addition, our investment advisory agreement with FSOF may not be \"assigned\" without the consent of the fund or the fund's limited partners. Such an assignment may be deemed to occur in the event that our pre-IPO owners dispose of enough of their interests in us such that they no longer own a controlling interest in us. If such a deemed assignment occurs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary consents from FSOF, or its limited partners, or the necessary approvals from the boards and shareholders of the Fifth Street BDCs. An assignment, actual or constructive, would trigger these termination and consent provisions and, unless the necessary approvals and consents are obtained, could adversely affect our ability to continue managing these funds, resulting in the loss of assets under management and a corresponding loss of revenue.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nDifficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value of our AUM, causing clients to withdraw funds and making it more difficult to raise additional capital for our funds, each of which could materially reduce our revenues and adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe fees we earn under our investment management fee agreements are typically based on the market value of and investment income earned on our fee-earning AUM. In addition, the prices of the securities held in the portfolios we manage may decline due to any number of factors beyond our control, including, among others, political uncertainty, acts of terrorism, a declining stock market or general economic downturn. In difficult market conditions, the pace of client redemptions or withdrawals from our investment strategies could accelerate if clients move assets to investments they perceive as offering greater opportunity or lower risk. In addition, the share price of the common stock of our BDCs could fall below the net asset value as a result of investors selling their shares, which could make it more difficult for our BDCs to raise capital. See \"- Risks Related to Our Business Development Companies and Other Funds - Regulations governing the operation of FSC and FSFR as BDCs affect their ability to raise, and the way in which they raise, additional capital.\" Any decrease in AUM from these or other sources would result in lower fees paid to us by our funds. If our revenues decline without a commensurate reduction in our expenses, our net income will be reduced and our business may be negatively affected.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation. In particular, we are subject to regulation by the SEC, under the Federal securities laws (including the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or the Advisers Act, and the 1940 Act). In addition, the BDCs we manage are regulated by the SEC under the 1940 Act, and certain of their subsidiaries must comply with regulations adopted by the Small Business Administration, or SBA, in order to maintain their status as small business investment companies. We also must comply with NASDAQ rules and listing requirements and our BDCs are subject to NASDAQ rules and listing requirements. Finally, many of the activities that our BDCs or we engage in are subject to or potentially subject to (in the absence of certain exemptions that we rely on and must comply with) the jurisdiction and regulatory oversight of various other Federal regulatory agencies (including the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, and the Department of Labor, or DOL), various self-regulatory organizations (including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, and the National Futures Association, or NFA) and various state regulatory authorities.\nThe various legal statutes and regulatory rules that we are subject to are extremely complex, and monitoring compliance with them can be a time-consuming and difficult task. For example, the Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on investment advisers, including record keeping, advertising and operating requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on misleading or fraudulent activities. The Advisers Act also imposes an overriding fiduciary duty on investment advisers. The 1940 Act imposes similar obligations on BDCs, as well as additional detailed operational requirements that must be strictly adhered to by their investment advisers and other service providers. A failure to comply with the obligations imposed by the Advisers Act, the 1940 Act or other regulatory agencies could result in investigations, sanctions and reputational damage.\nAs we develop new investment strategies and businesses, we expect to become subject to additional regulations and oversight by regulatory agencies with which we do not currently have experience.\nFailure to comply with various laws and regulations applicable to our BDCs and ourselves could have a materially adverse impact on our business. These include the possibility of significant civil or criminal fines, censure, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions (including the possibility of being barred from the industry) or the revocation of the registration of our subsidiary investment adviser. Moreover, even if the announcement of a sanction imposed against us, one of our subsidiaries or our personnel by a regulator is for a small monetary amount, the adverse publicity related to the sanction could harm our reputation, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our businesses in a number of ways, making it harder for us to raise new funds and discouraging others from doing business with us. Additionally, the bringing of a significant enforcement action against us could cause irreparable damage to our business reputation and ability to remain in business,\nregardless of the merits of the claim against us. See \"Business - Regulatory and Compliance Matters.\"\nThe regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to continual change and regulatory developments designed to increase oversight may adversely affect our business.\nThe regulatory environment in which we operate has undergone significant changes in the recent past, including the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the adoption of many new rules and regulations in response. We believe there may be more regulatory changes in our industry, which would result in subjecting participants to significant additional regulation. The requirements imposed by our regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with us. These regulations often serve to limit our activities, including through customer protection and market conduct requirements. New laws or regulations, or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations, applicable to us and our clients may adversely affect our business. Our ability to function in this environment depends on our ability to constantly monitor and promptly react to legislative and regulatory changes. For investment management firms in general, there have been a number of highly publicized regulatory inquiries that focus on the asset management industry. These inquiries already have resulted in increased scrutiny in the industry and new rules and regulations for investment managers. This regulatory scrutiny may limit our ability to engage in certain activities that might be beneficial to our stockholders. See \"Business - Regulatory and Compliance Matters.\"\nIn addition, as a result of the recent economic downturn, acts of serious fraud in the asset management industry and perceived lapses in regulatory oversight, U.S. governmental and regulatory authorities may increase regulatory oversight of our businesses. We may be materially adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the SEC, other U.S. governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets. We also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations. It is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, or whether any of the proposals will become law. The enactment of new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business.\nWe may not be able to maintain our current fee structure as a result of industry pressure to reduce fees, or as a result of changes in our business mix, which could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to maintain our current fee structure as a result of industry pressure to reduce fees or as a result of changes in our business mix. Although our investment management fees vary from product to product, historically we have competed primarily on the basis of our performance and not on the level of our investment fees relative to those of our competitors. In recent years, however, there has been a general trend toward lower fees in the investment management industry. In order to maintain our fee structure in a competitive environment, we must be able to continue to provide clients with investment returns and service that incentivize our investors to pay our fees. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in providing investment returns and service that will allow us to maintain our current fee structure.\nThe board of directors of each BDC we manage must make certain findings as to the reasonableness of our fees and can renegotiate them annually. Fee reductions on existing or future new business could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations.\nThe investment management industry faces substantial litigation risks which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us.\nWe depend to a large extent on our network of relationships and on our reputation in order to attract and retain investors and clients. If an investor or client is not satisfied with our products or services, such dissatisfaction, especially communicated to others, may be more damaging to our business than to other types of businesses. We make investment decisions on behalf of our clients that could result in substantial losses to them. If our investors and/or clients suffer significant losses, or are otherwise dissatisfied with our services, we could be subject to the risk of legal liabilities or actions alleging negligent misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, unjust enrichment or fraud. These risks are often difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time, even after an action has been commenced. We may incur significant legal expenses in defending against litigation. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could cause significant reputational harm to us and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with guidelines set by our clients, the boards of our BDCs or regulators could result in damage awards against us and a loss of assets under management, either of which could cause our earnings to decline.\nAs an investment adviser, we have a fiduciary duty to our clients. When clients retain us to manage assets on their behalf, they may specify certain guidelines regarding investment allocation and strategy that we are required to follow in the management of their portfolios. In addition, the boards of the BDCs we manage have established similar guidelines regarding the investment of assets in those funds. We are also required to invest the BDCs' assets in accordance with limitations under the\n1940 Act and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. Our failure to comply with these guidelines and other limitations could result in losses to a client or an investor in a fund, as the case may be, who could seek to recover damages from us or could result in the client withdrawing its assets from our management or the fund terminating our management agreement. Any of these events could harm our reputation and cause our earnings to decline significantly.\nRisks Related to Our Business Development Companies and Other Funds\nChanges in interest rates may affect the cost of capital and net investment income for our BDCs.\nBecause our BDCs borrow to fund their investments, a portion of their net investment income may be dependent upon the difference between the interest rate at which they borrow funds and the interest rate at which they invest these funds. Portions of the Fifth Street BDCs investment portfolio and borrowings will likely have floating interest rate components from time to time. As a result, a significant change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Fifth Street BDCs' net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds could increase, which would reduce the Fifth Street BDCs' net investment income to the extent investments are at fixed rates. The Fifth Street BDCs may hedge against such interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, futures, options and forward contracts, subject to applicable legal requirements, including without limitation, all necessary registrations (or exemptions from registration) with the CFTC. These activities may limit the Fifth Street BDCs' ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the hedged borrowings. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Fifth Street BDCs, which would have a negative impact on our revenues, net income and cash flows.\nA significant portion of each of the Fifth Street BDCs' investment portfolios is and will continue to be recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by each BDC's respective board of directors and, as a result, there is and will continue to be uncertainty as to the value of the portfolio investments of the Fifth Street BDCs.\nUnder the 1940 Act, BDCs are required to carry portfolio investments at market value or, if there is no readily available market value, at fair value as determined by the board of directors of such BDC. Typically, there is not a public market for the securities of the privately held companies in which the Fifth Street BDCs have invested and will generally continue to invest. As a result, each of the Fifth Street BDCs value these securities quarterly at fair value as determined in good faith by their respective board of directors.\nCertain factors that may be considered in determining the fair value of investments of the Fifth Street BDCs include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's earnings and its ability to make payments on its indebtedness, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to comparable publicly-traded companies, discounted cash flow and other relevant factors. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates, a determination of fair value by a Fifth Street BDC may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. In addition, any investments that include original issue discount or PIK interest may have unreliable valuations because their continuing accruals require ongoing judgments about the collectability of their deferred payments and the value of their underlying collateral. As a result, the value for certain assets may never be realized, which may materially adversely affect our investment performance and our results of operations.\nMarket values of debt instruments and publicly-traded securities that our funds hold as investments may be volatile.\nThe market prices of debt instruments and publicly-traded securities held by the Fifth Street BDCs may be volatile and are likely to fluctuate due to a number of factors beyond their or our control, including actual or anticipated changes in the profitability of the issuers of such securities, general economic, social or political developments, changes in industry conditions, changes in government regulation, shortfalls in operating results from levels forecast by securities analysts, inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates, the general state of the securities markets and other material events, such as significant management changes, financings, refinancings, securities issuances, acquisitions and dispositions. The value of publicly-traded securities in which the Fifth Street BDCs invest may be particularly volatile as a result of these factors. In addition, debt instruments that are held by our funds to maturity or for long terms must be \"marked-to-market\" periodically, and their values are therefore vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations and the changes in the general state of the credit environment, notwithstanding their underlying performance. Changes in the values of these investments may adversely affect our investment performance and our results of operations.\nSubstantially all of the assets of the Fifth Street BDCs are subject to security interests under secured credit facilities or, in the case of certain assets of FSC, subject to a superior claim over its stockholders by the U.S. Small Business Administration and, if a Fifth Street BDC defaults on its obligations under the facilities or with respect to SBA-guaranteed debentures, it may suffer adverse consequences, including foreclosure on its assets.\nAs of December 31, 2014, substantially all of the assets of the Fifth Street BDCs were pledged as collateral under their credit facilities or, in the case of certain assets of FSC, subject to a superior claim over its stockholders by the U.S. Small Business Administration, or SBA. If a Fifth Street BDC defaults on its obligations under these facilities or SBA-guaranteed debentures, as may be applicable, the lenders and/or the SBA may have the right to foreclose upon and sell, or otherwise transfer, the collateral subject to their security interests or their superior claim. In such event, such Fifth Street BDC may be forced to sell its investments to raise funds to repay its outstanding borrowings in order to avoid foreclosure and these forced sales may be at times and at prices it would not consider advantageous. Moreover, such deleveraging of the BDC could significantly impair its ability to effectively operate its business in the manner in which it has historically operated. As a result, it could be forced to curtail or cease new investment activities and lower or eliminate the dividends that it has historically paid to its stockholders. In addition, if the lenders exercise their right to sell the assets pledged under such Fifth Street BDC's credit facilities, such sales may be completed at distressed sale prices, thereby diminishing or potentially eliminating the amount of cash available to the BDC after repayment of the amounts outstanding under the credit facilities.\nA failure on the part of the Fifth Street BDCs to maintain their qualifications as BDCs would significantly reduce their operating flexibility.\nOur BDCs are subject to complex rules under the 1940 Act, including rules that restrict them from engaging in transactions with affiliates, generally prohibit them from issuing and selling their common stock at a price below net asset value per share and from incurring indebtedness (including for this purpose, preferred stock), if their asset coverage, as calculated pursuant to the 1940 Act, equals less than 200% after such incurrence. Also under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than qualifying assets, as defined in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company's total assets. If either of the Fifth Street BDCs fails to continuously qualify as a BDC, such BDC might be subject to regulation as a registered closed-end investment company under the 1940 Act, which would significantly decrease its operating flexibility. In addition, failure to comply with the requirements imposed on BDCs by the 1940 Act could cause the SEC to bring an enforcement action against such BDC. See \"Business - Our Investment Vehicles - Business Development Companies\" and \"Business - Regulatory and Compliance Matters - SEC Regulation.\"\nA Fifth Street BDC's failure to qualify or remain qualified as a RIC would subject it to U.S. federal income tax and would adversely affect its, and in turn our, financial results.\nOur BDCs have each elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the Code. A BDC treated as a RIC generally will not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any net ordinary income and realized net capital gains that are distributed to its stockholders if it meets certain source-of-income, income distribution, asset diversification and other requirements imposed under the Code. If a BDC were to fail to meet one or more of these requirements and such BDC were unable to correct such failure or failures under applicable statutory cure provisions, such BDC generally would be required to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on its taxable net income, regardless of whether such net income were distributed to its stockholders. As a result, a loss of RIC status by one of our BDCs would have a negative impact on such BDC's business and financial results, and therefore a negative impact on our revenues, net income and cash flows. The RIC qualification status of our BDCs is actively monitored by our personnel and professional advisors, and it is expected that each BDC qualifies and will continue to qualify as a RIC. However, the RIC requirements require an analysis of a variety of facts about each BDC on an ongoing basis, and there can be no assurance that any of our BDCs will not cease to qualify as a RIC at some point in the future.\nRegulations governing the operation of FSC and FSFR as BDCs affect their ability to raise, and the way in which they raise, additional capital.\nAs BDCs, FSC and FSFR operate as highly regulated businesses within the provisions of the 1940 Act. Many of the regulations governing BDCs have not been modernized in the light of recent securities laws amendments and restrict, among other things, leverage incurrence, co-investments and other transactions with other entities within Fifth Street and the Fifth Street Funds. The BDC industry has proposed certain legislation to address some of these issues, but there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted. Certain of our funds may be restricted from engaging in transactions with FSC and FSFR and their respective subsidiaries.\nAs BDCs registered under the 1940 Act, FSC and FSFR may issue preferred stock, debt securities and borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, which we refer to collectively as \"senior securities,\" up to the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act. Under the provisions of the 1940 Act, each of the Fifth Street BDCs is permitted to issue senior securities only in amounts such that its asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. If the value of their assets decline, they may be unable to satisfy this test. If that happens, they may be required to sell a portion of their investments and, depending on the nature of their leverage, repay a portion of their indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous. The BDC industry has proposed legislation to lessen the asset\ncoverage test, but there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted.\nBDCs may issue and sell common stock at a price below net asset value per share only in limited circumstances, one of which is during the one-year period after stockholder approval. The stockholders of each of FSC and FSFR have, in the past, approved such a proposal. FSC and FSFR may ask their stockholders for such approvals from year to year. There can be no assurance that such approvals will be obtained. If FSC and FSFR are not able to grow through public or private offerings of their common stock, we may not be able to increase our AUM at such companies or the revenues earned from such companies.\nThere are significant potential conflicts of interest that could adversely impact investment returns of the Fifth Street BDCs.\nFifth Street Management has adopted, and the board of directors of each of FSC and FSFR has approved, an investment allocation policy that governs the allocation of investment opportunities among the investment funds managed by Fifth Street Management and its affiliates. To the extent an investment opportunity is appropriate for one of the BDCs or any other investment fund managed by our affiliates, and co-investment is not possible, Fifth Street Management will adhere to its investment allocation policy in order to determine to which entity to allocate the opportunity. Any such opportunity will be allocated first to the entity whose investment strategy is the most consistent with the opportunity being allocated, and second, if the terms of the opportunity are consistent with more than one entity's investment strategy, on an alternating basis. Although our investment professionals will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, either of FSC, FSFR or another fund that we manage could be adversely affected to the extent investment opportunities are allocated among the investment vehicles managed or sponsored by, or affiliated with, our executive officers, directors and Fifth Street Management. There is no guarantee that Fifth Street Management will make the correct decision in such allocation.\nThe 1940 Act prohibits the Fifth Street BDCs from making certain negotiated co-investments with affiliates, unless such BDC receives an order from the SEC permitting it to do so. Fifth Street Management and certain of its affiliates received an exemptive order from the SEC on September 9, 2014 that permits each of the Fifth Street BDCs to co-invest with other funds managed by Fifth Street Management or its affiliates in negotiated transactions in a manner consistent with its investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements (including the terms and conditions of the exemptive order).\nFifth Street Management's investment allocation policy is also designed to manage and mitigate conflicts of interest associated with the allocation of investment opportunities if one of the Fifth Street BDCs is able to co-invest, either pursuant to SEC interpretive positions or the exemptive order, with other funds managed by Fifth Street Management or its affiliates. Generally, under the investment allocation policy, if a Fifth Street BDC is permitted to co-invest pursuant to the exemptive order, co-investments will be allocated pursuant to the conditions of the exemptive order. If a Fifth Street BDC is able to co-invest pursuant to SEC interpretive positions, generally, under the investment allocation policy, a portion of each opportunity that is appropriate for such BDC and any affiliated fund will be offered to such BDC and such other eligible accounts as determined by Fifth Street Management and generally based on asset class, fund size and liquidity, among other factors. If there is a sufficient amount of securities to satisfy all participants, the securities will be allocated among the participants in accordance with their order size and if there is an insufficient amount of securities to satisfy all participants, the securities will be allocated pro rata based on the allocation that each participant would have received if there was a sufficient amount of securities. Fifth Street Management seeks to treat all clients fairly and equitably such that none receive preferential treatment vis-\u00e0-vis the others over time, in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duty to each of them; however, in some instances, especially in instances of limited liquidity, the factors may not result in pro rata allocations or may result in situations where certain funds receive allocations where others do not.\nOur funds' investments in portfolio companies may be risky, and our funds could lose all or part of their investments.\nThe companies in which our funds invest are typically highly leveraged, and, in most cases, our funds' investments in such companies are not rated by any rating agency. If such investments were rated, we believe that they would likely receive a rating from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization of below investment grade (i.e., below BBB- by S&P or Baa by Moody's). Exposure to below investment grade securities involves certain risks, and those securities are viewed as having predominately speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. Investing in small and mid-sized companies involves a number of significant risks. Among other things, these companies:\n\u2022\nmay have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their debt instruments that our funds hold, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of us realizing any guarantees from subsidiaries or affiliates of our funds' portfolio companies that they may have obtained in connection with their investments, as well as a corresponding decrease in the value of the equity components of our funds' investments;\n\u2022\nmay have shorter operating histories, narrower product lines, smaller market shares and/or significant customer\nconcentrations than larger businesses, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors' actions and market conditions, as well as general economic downturns;\n\u2022\nare more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons; therefore, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on our funds' portfolio companies and, in turn, on our funds;\n\u2022\ngenerally have less predictable operating results, may from time to time be parties to litigation, may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence, and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position; and\n\u2022\ngenerally have less publicly available information about their businesses, operations and financial condition.\nIf our funds are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, our funds may not make a fully informed investment decision, and as a result may lose part or all their investment. In addition, in the course of providing significant managerial assistance to certain of the Fifth Street BDC's portfolio companies, certain of our officers may serve as directors on the boards of such companies. To the extent that litigation arises out of our funds' investments in these companies, our officers may be named as defendants in such litigation, which could result in an expenditure of funds (through our funds' indemnification of such officers) and the diversion of management time and resources.\nAn investment strategy focused primarily on privately held companies presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies.\nOur funds invest primarily in privately held companies. Generally, little public information exists about these companies, including typically a lack of audited financial statements and ratings by third parties. Our funds must therefore rely on their adviser's ability to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential risks of investing in these companies. These companies and their financial information may not be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules that govern public companies. If our funds are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, our funds may not make a fully informed investment decision, and our funds may lose money on our investments. These factors could affect the investment return of our funds and affect our results of operations.\nIf our funds make unsecured debt investments, they may lack adequate protection in the event their portfolio companies become distressed or insolvent and they will likely experience a lower recovery than more senior debtholders in the event their portfolio companies defaults on their indebtedness.\nOur funds have made, and may in the future make, unsecured debt investments in portfolio companies. Unsecured debt investments are unsecured and junior to other indebtedness of the portfolio company. As a consequence, the holder of an unsecured debt investment may lack adequate protection in the event the portfolio company becomes distressed or insolvent and will likely experience a lower recovery than more senior debtholders in the event the portfolio company defaults on its indebtedness. In addition, unsecured debt investments of small and mid-sized companies are often highly illiquid and in adverse market conditions may experience steep declines in valuation even if they are fully performing.\nThe lack of liquidity in our funds' investments may adversely affect their businesses.\nOur funds invest, and will continue to invest, in companies whose securities are not publicly-traded, and whose securities are subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or are otherwise less liquid than publicly-traded securities. In fact, all of our funds' assets may be invested in illiquid securities. The illiquidity of these investments may make it difficult for our funds to sell these investments when desired. In addition, if any our funds are required to liquidate all or a portion of its portfolio quickly, such fund may realize significantly less than the value at which it had previously recorded these investments. Our funds' investments are usually subject to contractual or legal restrictions on resale or are otherwise illiquid because there is usually no established trading market for such investments. The illiquidity of most of our funds' investments may make it difficult for our funds to dispose of them at a favorable price, and, as a result, our funds may suffer losses, which could affect our results of operations.\nOur funds may not have the funds or ability to make additional investments in their portfolio companies.\nAfter an initial investment in a portfolio company, our funds may be called upon from time to time to provide additional funds to such company or have the opportunity to increase their investments through the exercise of a warrant to purchase common stock. There is no assurance that our funds will make, or will have sufficient funds to make, follow-on investments. Any decisions not to make a follow-on investment or any inability on our funds' part to make such an investment may have a negative impact on a portfolio company in need of such an investment, may result in a missed opportunity for such fund to increase its participation in a successful operation or may reduce the expected yield on the investment.\nOur funds' portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the funds' investments in such\ncompanies.\nOur funds invest primarily in first lien, second lien and subordinated debt issued by small and mid-sized companies. Our funds' portfolio companies may have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the debt in which our funds invest. By their terms, such debt instruments may entitle the holders to receive payments of interest or principal on or before the dates on which our funds are entitled to receive payments with respect to the debt instruments in which our funds invest. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our funds' investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before our funds receive any distribution. After repaying such senior creditors, such portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to our funds. In the case of debt ranking equally with debt instruments in which our funds invest, such funds would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company.\nWe generally do not, and do not expect to, control our portfolio companies.\nOur funds do not, and do not expect to, control most of their portfolio companies, even though our funds may have board representation or board observation rights, and our funds' debt agreements may contain certain restrictive covenants. As a result, our funds are subject to the risk that a portfolio company in which they invest may make business decisions with which our funds disagree and the management of such company, as representatives of the holders of their common equity, may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our funds' interests as a debt investor. Due to the lack of liquidity for our funds' investments in non-traded companies, our funds may not be able to dispose of their interests in portfolio companies as readily as such funds would like or at an appropriate valuation. As a result, a portfolio company may make decisions that could decrease the value of our funds' portfolio holdings, having a negative effect on our results of operations.\nDefaults by our funds' portfolio companies would harm our funds' operating results.\nA portfolio company's failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by our funds or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of its loans and foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize a portfolio company's ability to meet its obligations under the debt or equity securities that our funds hold. Such funds may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms, which may include the waiver of certain financial covenants, with a defaulting portfolio company.\nDependence on leverage by certain of our funds and by our funds' portfolio companies subjects us to volatility and contractions in the debt financing markets and could adversely affect our funds' ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments.\nFSC, FSFR, our Senior Loan Funds and FSOF and our funds' portfolio companies currently rely on the use of leverage, and our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on investments will depend on our ability to access sufficient sources of indebtedness at attractive rates. While the funds mentioned above are our only funds that currently rely on the use of leverage, certain of our other funds may in the future rely on the use of leverage. If our funds or the companies in which our funds invest raise capital in the structured credit, leveraged loan and high yield bond markets, the results of their operations may suffer if such markets experience dislocations, contractions or volatility. Any such events could adversely impact the availability of credit to businesses generally and could lead to an overall weakening of the U.S. and global economies. Any economic downturn could adversely affect the financial resources of our funds and their investments (in particular those investments that depend on credit from third parties or that otherwise participate in the credit markets) and their ability to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance, outstanding debt when due. Moreover, these events could affect the terms of available debt financing with, for example, higher interest rates, higher equity requirements and/or more restrictive covenants.\nThe absence of available sources of sufficient debt financing for extended periods of time or an increase in either the general levels of interest rates or in the risk spread demanded by sources of indebtedness would make it more expensive to finance those investments. Certain investments may also be financed through borrowings on fund-level debt facilities, which may or may not be available for a refinancing at the end of their respective terms. Finally, the interest payments on the indebtedness used to finance our funds' investments are generally deductible expenses for income tax purposes, subject to limitations under applicable tax law and policy. Any change in such tax law or policy to eliminate or substantially limit these income tax deductions, as has been discussed from time to time in various jurisdictions, would reduce the after-tax rates of return on the affected investments, which may have an adverse impact on our businesses and financial results.\nSimilarly, our funds' portfolio companies regularly utilize the corporate debt markets to obtain additional financing for their operations. Our funds' portfolio companies are typically highly leveraged. Those that have credit ratings are typically non-investment grade and those that do not have credit ratings would likely be non-investment grade if they were rated. If the credit markets render such financing difficult to obtain or more expensive, this may negatively impact the operating performance of\nthose portfolio companies and, therefore, the investment returns of our funds. In addition, if the markets make it difficult or impossible to refinance debt that is maturing in the near term, some of our funds' portfolio companies may be unable to repay such debt at maturity and may be forced to sell assets, undergo a recapitalization or seek bankruptcy protection. Any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur funds may choose to use leverage as part of their respective investment programs. Below is a summary of each Fifth Street fund that utilized leverage as of December 31, 2014 (shown in thousands):\n____________________\n(1) FSC has received exemptive relief from the SEC to exclude debentures issued by the Small Business Administration from the definition of senior securities in the 200% asset coverage test under the 1940 Act, which allows greater flexibility under the test.\nThe use of leverage poses a significant degree of risk and enhances the possibility of a significant loss to investors. A fund may borrow money from time to time to make investments or may enter into derivative transactions with counterparties that have embedded leverage. The interest expense and other costs incurred in connection with such borrowing may not be recovered by returns on such investments and may be lost, and the timing and magnitude of such losses may be accelerated or exacerbated, in the event of a decline in the market value of such investments. Gains realized with borrowed funds may cause the fund's net asset value to increase at a faster rate than would be the case without borrowings. However, if investment results fail to cover the cost of borrowings, the fund's net asset value could also decrease faster than if there had been no borrowings. In addition, as BDCs regulated under the 1940 Act, FSC and FSFR are each permitted to issue senior securities in amounts such that its asset coverage ratio equals at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. Each of FSC's and FSFR's ability to pay dividends will be restricted if its asset coverage ratio falls below at least 200% and any amounts that it uses to service its indebtedness are not available for dividends to its common stockholders. An increase in interest rates could also decrease the value of fixed rate debt investments that our funds make. Any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Class A Common Stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume on our Class A common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our Class A common stock declines significantly, you may be unable to resell your shares of Class A common stock at or above your purchase price, if at all. We cannot assure you that the market price of our Class A common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our Class A common stock, or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our Class A common stock, include:\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet our earnings estimates;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or the investment management industry, or the failure of securities analysts to cover our Class A common stock;\n\u2022\ndepartures of our Principals or additions/departures of other key personnel;\n\u2022\nadverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future;\n\u2022\nactions by stockholders;\n\u2022\nmaterial changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated poor performance in our underlying investment strategies;\n\u2022\nchanges or proposed changes in laws or regulation, or differing interpretations thereof, affecting our business, or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity about the investment management industry, generally, or individual scandals specifically;\n\u2022\nlitigation and governmental investigations; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may decline due to the potential for future sales of our Class A common stock on the exchange of Holdings LP Interests.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock by us or the exchange of Holdings LP Interests by the Holdings Limited Partners (such exchanges to be permitted at specified quarterly exchange dates beginning two years after the closing of our initial public offering), or the perception that such sales or exchanges could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling equity securities in the future, at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had a total of 6,000,033 shares of our Class A common stock outstanding. All of the 6,000,033 shares of our Class A common stock outstanding are freely tradeable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act by persons other than our \"affiliates.\"\nPursuant to the terms of an Exchange Agreement that we entered into at the time of our initial public offering, the Holdings Limited Partners may from time to time, beginning two years after our initial public offering, exchange their Holdings LP Interests for shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. As of December 31, 2014, the Holdings Limited Partners beneficially own 44,000,000 Holdings LP Interests in the aggregate, which will be exchangeable for 44,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock in the aggregate, subject to certain limits.\nPursuant to a resale and registration rights agreement with the Holdings Limited Partners, we have agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to file registration statements from time to time for the sale of the shares of our Class A common stock, including Class A common stock which is deliverable upon exchange of Holdings LP Interests.\nIn addition, effective January 2015, 14,333,718 shares of Class A common stock are reserved for issuance under our 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan. On January 1, 2016, and ending on and including January 1, 2024, the foregoing share reserve amount will be increased by a number of shares of our Class A common stock equal to the positive difference, if any, of (x) 15% of the aggregate number of Class A common stock (including partnership interests exchangeable into Class A common stock) outstanding on the last day of the prior year minus (y) the total number of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance on such last day (or such lesser amount as determined by the Compensation Committee). As of December 31, 2014, we have options outstanding with respect to 5,658,970 shares of our Class A common stock and unvested restricted stock units with respect to 1,174,748 shares of Class A common stock. Upon the exercise of outstanding options and vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, shares of our Class A common stock will be issued and become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject to certain legal and contractual restrictions.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Class A common stock may have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nThe potential requirement to convert our financial statements from being prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to International Financial Reporting Standards may strain our resources and increase our annual expenses.\nAs a public entity, the SEC may require in the future that we report our financial results under International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, instead of under GAAP. IFRS is a set of accounting principles that has been gaining acceptance on a worldwide basis. These standards are published by the London-based International Accounting Standards Board, or IASB, and are more focused on objectives and principles and less reliant on detailed rules than GAAP. Today, there remain significant and material differences in several key areas between GAAP and IFRS which would affect us. Additionally, GAAP provides specific guidance in classes of accounting transactions for which equivalent guidance in IFRS does not exist. The adoption of IFRS would be highly complex and would have an impact on many aspects of us and our operations, including but not limited to financial accounting and reporting systems, internal controls, taxes, borrowing covenants and cash management. It is expected that a significant amount of time, internal and external resources and expenses over a multi-year period would be required for this conversion.\nThe requirements of being a public entity and sustaining growth may strain our resources.\nAs a newly public entity, we are subject to the rules and requirements of the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-\nFrank Act, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, and NASDAQ, each of which imposes additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. These requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources. For example, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, which is discussed below.\nWe have been and will continue to be implementing additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. In addition, sustaining our growth also will require us to commit additional management, operational, and financial resources to identify new professionals to join the firm and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion. These activities may divert management's attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We expect to incur significant additional annual expenses related to these steps and, among other things, additional directors' and officers' liability insurance, director fees, reporting requirements of the SEC, transfer agent fees, hiring additional accounting, legal and administrative personnel, increased auditing, tax and legal fees and similar expenses.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that, if not properly remediated, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements in future periods.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we identified a material weakness relating to our internal control over financial reporting under standards established by the PCAOB. The PCAOB defines a material weakness as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.\nThe material weakness identified related to our having insufficient access to accounting resources with technical accounting expertise to analyze complex and non-routine transactions, as well as inadequate internal review. The material weakness was identified as the primary cause of errors relating to the treatment of stock-based compensation and liabilities associated with existing membership units, and the consequent improper recording of certain equity transactions, as well as incorrectly recording expenses reimbursable by our BDCs on a net basis.\nIn addition, we identified a revision to our previously filed 2013 combined financial statements resulting from the presentation of noncash capital contributions and noncash distributions to members of approximately $5.7 million within cash flows from financing activities rather than as noncash financing activities. The revision to correct the presentation had no net effect on cash flows from financing activities or cash and cash equivalents.\nWe have taken and will take a number of actions to remediate this material weakness including, but not limited to, adding senior experienced accounting and financial personnel, reallocating existing internal resources, upgrading our accounting systems, including a new fund accounting platform, and retaining third-party consultants to help enhance our internal control over financial reporting following reviews of our accounting and finance function conducted by members of senior management. We cannot assure you when we will remediate such weakness, nor can we be certain of whether additional actions will be required or the costs of any such actions.\nWe may need to take additional measures to fully mitigate these issues, and the measures we have taken, and expect to take, to improve our internal controls may not be sufficient to address the issues identified, to ensure that our internal controls are effective or to ensure that the identified material weakness or significant deficiencies or other material weaknesses or deficiencies will not result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In addition, other material weaknesses or deficiencies may be identified in the future. If we are unable to correct material weaknesses or deficiencies in internal controls in a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC will be adversely affected. This failure could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our Class A common stock, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, and generally materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nPrior to our initial public offering, we were not required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, and were therefore not required to make an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. However, as a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting\nand to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. In addition, we will be required to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 at the time of our second annual report on Form 10-K, which will be for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2015. We are in the process of designing, implementing and testing the internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation, which process is time consuming, costly and complex. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness previously described or if, in the future, we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Class A common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the SEC, NASDAQ or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nWe are an emerging growth company and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our Class A common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to, an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404, a provision allowing us to provide fewer years of financial statements and other financial data in this prospectus and reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements. We have elected to adopt these reduced disclosure requirements and the exemption from the auditor attestation requirement available to emerging growth companies. We will remain an emerging growth company until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, although a variety of circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier. We cannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result of our choices, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock, and the price of our Class A common stock may be more volatile.\nWe are controlled by the Principals, whose interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Principals hold approximately 97.3% of the combined voting power of our common stock. So long as the Principals continue to hold, directly or indirectly, shares of common stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of our common stock, the Principals are able to exercise control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions, and have significant control over our management and the Principal's control may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares, which could prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares. These actions may be taken even if other stockholders oppose them. The interests of the Principals may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders, and the Principals may act in a manner that advances its best interests and not necessarily those of our other stockholders.\nWe are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of NASDAQ rules and, as a result, qualify for, and intend to rely on certain of the \"controlled company\" exemptions from certain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements. Our stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of other companies.\nUnder NASDAQ rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a \"controlled company\" and may elect not to comply with certain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements. As of December 31, 2014, the Principals held approximately 97.3% of the combined voting power of our common stock. As such we are eligible to take advantage of this \"controlled company\" exemption. A \"controlled company\" may elect not to comply with certain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that (1) a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors, (2) compensation of officers be determined or recommended to the board of directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and (3) director nominees be selected or recommended by a majority of the independent directors or by a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors. We intend to continue to take advantage of the controlled company exemption relating to the requirement that director nominees be selected or recommended by a majority of the independent directors or by a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors. Accordingly, our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a change of control that our stockholders may favor, which could negatively affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our\nstockholders. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt. The market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected to the extent that the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws discourage potential takeover attempts that our stockholders may favor.\nRisks Relating to Our Structure\nOur ability to pay regular dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by our holding company structure and applicable provisions of Delaware law.\nWe currently intend to pay cash dividends to the holders of our Class A common stock on a quarterly basis. Our Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, decrease the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. In addition, as a holding company, we will be dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to generate earnings and cash flows and distribute them to us so that we may pay dividends to our stockholders. We expect to cause Fifth Street Holdings to make distributions to its members, including us. However, its ability to make such distributions will be subject to its operating results, cash requirements and financial condition, the applicable provisions of Delaware law which may limit the amount of funds available for distribution to its members, its compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness, and its other agreements with third parties. In addition, each of the companies in the corporate chain must manage its assets, liabilities and working capital in order to meet all of its cash obligations, including the payment of dividends or distributions.\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, we may only pay dividends from legally available surplus or, if there is no such surplus, out of our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Surplus is defined as the excess of a company's total assets over the sum of its total liabilities plus the par value of its outstanding capital stock. Under the DGCL, our Board of Directors can use the fair value of assets and liabilities, rather than book value, in making this determination. Under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, or the Delaware Limited Partnership Act, Fifth Street Holdings may not make a distribution to a partner if, after the distribution, all its liabilities, other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specific property of the partnership, would exceed the fair value of our assets. If Fifth Street Holdings were to make such an impermissible distribution, any limited partner who received a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution was in violation of the Delaware Limited Partnership Act would be liable to Fifth Street Holdings for the amount of the distribution for three years. See \"Item 5 - Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Dividend Policy.\"\nOur ability to pay taxes and expenses may be limited by our holding company structure and applicable provisions of Delaware law.\nAs a holding company, we will have no material assets other than our ownership of partnership interests of Fifth Street Holdings and will have no independent means of generating revenue. Fifth Street Holdings will be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, taxable income will be allocated to its partners, including us, pro rata according to the number of partnership interests each owns. Accordingly, we will incur U.S. federal income taxes on our proportionate share of any net taxable income of Fifth Street Holdings and will also incur expenses related to our operations. We intend to cause Fifth Street Holdings to distribute cash to its members, including us. However, its ability to make such distributions will be subject to various limitations as set forth in the preceding risk factor. If, as a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, we do not have sufficient funds to pay tax or other liabilities to fund our operations, we may have to borrow funds and thus, our liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe will be required to pay the TRA Recipients most of the tax benefit of any depreciation or amortization deductions we may claim as a result of the tax basis step up we receive in connection with the exchanges of Holdings LP Interests.\nAny taxable exchanges by the TRA Recipients of Holdings LP Interests for shares of our Class A common stock and payments under the tax receivable agreement are expected to result in increases in the tax basis in the tangible and intangible assets of Fifth Street Holdings connected with such Holdings LP Interests. The increase in tax basis is expected to reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, might challenge all or part of this tax basis increase, and a court might sustain such a challenge.\nThe tax receivable agreement that we entered into with the TRA Recipients generally provides that we will pay them 85% of the amount of the cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax that we realize (or, under certain circumstances, are deemed to realize) as a result of these increases in tax basis. Assuming no material relevant tax law changes and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize the full tax benefits of the increased depreciation and amortization of our assets, we expect that the future payments to the TRA Recipients in respect of the sale of Holdings LP Interests will\naggregate to $47.4 million. The actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under this agreement, will vary depending on a number of factors, including the price of our Class A common stock at the time of the purchase, the amount and timing of our income and the tax rates then applicable. Similarly, the tax receivable agreement payments related to the future exchanges will vary based on the timing of the exchanges, the price of the Class A common stock at the time of the exchanges, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable, the amount and timing of our income and the tax rates then applicable. The tax receivable agreement payments related to future exchanges have not been included in the above amounts. We expect that, as a result of the increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Fifth Street Holdings attributable to the exchanged Holdings LP Interests, the payments that we may make to the TRA Recipients will be substantial.\nMoreover, if we exercise our right to terminate the tax receivable agreement early, we will be obligated to make an early termination payment to the TRA Recipients, or their transferees, based upon the net present value (based upon certain assumptions in the tax receivable agreement, including the assumption that we would have enough taxable income in the future to fully utilize the tax benefit resulting from any increased tax basis that results from an exchange) of all payments that would be required to be paid by us under the tax receivable agreement. If certain change of control events were to occur, we would be obligated to make payments to the TRA Recipients using certain assumptions and deemed events similar to those used to calculate an early termination payment.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement if the basis increases described above were successfully challenged by the IRS or another taxing authority. As a result, in certain circumstances, payments could be made under the tax receivable agreement in excess of our cash tax savings.", "PERMNO": 15008, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "FSAM"}
