RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this annual report, the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating Nabors. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks included in this annual report that we believe could adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\n\u25cf Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability.\n\u25cf Our customers and thereby our business and profitability could be adversely affected by low oil prices and/or turmoil in the global economy.\n\u25cf We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u25cf We must renew customer contracts to remain competitive.\n\u25cf The nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss, including weather-related risks, that could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u25cf Our drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated, suspended or terminated without an early termination payment.\n\u25cf The loss of one or a number of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25cf The profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by war, civil disturbance, terrorist activity or other political or economic instability, fluctuation in currency exchange rates and local import and export controls.\n\u25cf We rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, components and parts used in rig operations, conversions, upgrades and construction.\n\u25cf Our contracts with state-owned energy companies may expose us to greater risks than we normally assume in contracts with non-governmental customers.\n\u25cf Control of oil and natural gas reserves by state-owned energy companies may affect the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations.\n\u25cf Our operating expense includes fixed costs that may not decline in proportion to decreases in rig utilization and dayrates.\n\u25cf Actions of and disputes with our joint venture partners could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and consolidated results of operations.\n\u25cf Failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other strategic transactions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.\n\u25cf Decisions by internet service, cloud hosting service and related providers to restrict or ban our ability to use their platforms could adversely affect our ability to promote and conduct our business and inform investors.\n\u25cf We are subject to a number of uncertainties during the timeframe when Nabors Energy Transition Corporation (NETC) pursues a business combination, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and share price.\nFinancial Risks\n\u25cf We may record additional losses or impairment charges related to sold or idle drilling rigs and other assets.\n\u25cf Our financial and operating flexibility could be affected by our long-term debt and other financial commitments.\n\u25cf Our ability to access capital markets could be limited.\n\u25cf A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively affect our cost of capital and our ability to access capital markets or other financing sources.\nTechnology Risks\n\u25cf New technologies may cause our drilling methods and equipment to become less competitive and it may become necessary to incur higher levels of operating and capital expenditures in order to keep pace with the disruptive trends in the drilling industry. Growth through the building of new drilling rigs and improvement of existing rigs is not assured.\n\u25cf Limitations on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenues and any competitive advantage we hold.\n\u25cf Technology disputes could negatively affect our operations or increase our costs.\n\u25cf Improvements in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n\u25cf New and evolving regulations in the countries in which we operate (including the United States) concerning health and safety related to COVID-19 could have a material effect on our business.\n\u25cf Our international business exposes us to additional risks, including risks related to geopolitical and economic factors, laws and regulations, and compliance obligations and risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable anti-corruption laws. Violations of these laws could have a negative effect on our business.\n\u25cf Changes to or noncompliance with laws and regulations or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u25cf The physical effects of climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could have a negative effect on our business.\n\u25cf Legal proceedings and governmental investigations could affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25cf We may be subject to changes in tax laws and have additional tax liabilities.\n\u25cf The Company\u2019s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards, and possibly other tax attributes, to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances, including future transactions involving the sale or issuance of Company equity securities, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.\nShare Capital and Corporate Structure Risks\n\u25cf Significant issuances of common shares could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\n\u25cf Our common share price has been and may continue to be volatile.\n\u25cf Provisions in our organizational documents may be insufficient to thwart a coercive hostile takeover attempt; conversely, these provisions and those in our outstanding debt and Saudi joint venture documents may deter a change of control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium.\n\u25cf As a holding company, we depend on our operating subsidiaries and investments to meet our financial obligations.\nGeneral Risks\n\u25cf Investor sentiment and public perception related to the fossil fuels industry and to ESG initiatives could increase our costs of capital, our reporting requirements and our operations, which could negatively affect our stock price.\n\u25cf Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19, and future adverse effects could be material and difficult to predict.\n\u25cf Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks.\n\u25cf The loss of key executives or inability to attract and retain experienced technical professionals and talented personnel could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success.\nFor a more complete discussion of the risks facing our business, see below.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nFluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability.\nOur operations, demand for our services, and the rates we are able to charge for such services depend on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Both short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices affect these activity levels. Oil and natural gas prices, as well as the level of drilling, exploration and production activity, have been highly volatile for several years and are expected to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future. In addition to the COVID-19 outbreak contributing to a significant decline in oil prices in 2020, declines in oil prices are primarily caused by, among other things, an excess of supply of crude oil in relation to demand. Worldwide military, political, public health, and economic events, including initiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and OPEC+, uncertainty in capital and commodities markets, and the ability of oil and natural gas producers to access capital, and the extent to which they are willing or able to deploy capital, affect both the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas. In addition, weather conditions, governmental regulation (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of consumer demand for oil and natural gas, general and global economic conditions, oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries, decisions by oil and gas producers to continue producing oil and gas despite excess supply, the availability and demand for drilling equipment and pipeline capacity, availability and pricing of alternative energy sources, and other factors beyond our control may also affect the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, and thereby affect the price of oil and natural gas.\nLower oil and natural gas prices also could adversely affect our cash forecast models used to determine whether the carrying values of our long-lived assets exceed our future cash flows, which could result in future impairment to our long-lived assets. Lower oil and natural gas prices also could affect our ability to retain skilled rig personnel and affect our ability to access capital to finance and grow our business. There can be no assurances as to the future level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas and oilfield services industries.\nOur customers and thereby our business and profitability could be adversely affected by low oil prices and/or turmoil in the global economy.\nChanges in general economic and political conditions may negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, we are unable to fully predict the level of exploration, drilling and production activities of our customers and whether our customers and/or suppliers will be able to sustain their operations and fulfill their commitments and obligations. If oil prices decrease and/or global economic conditions deteriorate, there could be a material adverse effect on the liquidity and operations of our customers, vendors and other worldwide business partners, which in turn could have a material effect on our results of\noperations and liquidity. Furthermore, these conditions may result in certain of our customers experiencing an inability to pay vendors, including us. In addition, we may experience difficulties forecasting future capital expenditures by our customers, which in turn could lead to either over capacity or, in the event of further recovery in oil prices and the worldwide economy, under capacity, either of which could adversely affect our operations. There can be no assurance that the global economic environment will not deteriorate in the future due to one or more factors.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe oilfield services industry is very competitive with a significant amount of excess capacity, especially in low oil price environments. Contract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Rigs and drilling-related equipment can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of such rigs and drilling-related equipment in certain areas, and accordingly, increased price competition. In addition, an important factor in determining job awards is our ability to maintain a strong safety record. If we are unable to remain competitive based on these and/or other competitive factors, we may be unable to increase or even maintain our market share, utilization rates and/or day rates for our services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe must renew customer contracts to remain competitive.\nOur ability to renew existing customer contracts, or obtain new contracts, and the terms of any such contracts depends on market conditions and our customers\u2019 future drilling plans, which are subject to change. Due to the highly competitive nature of the industry, which can be exacerbated during periods of depressed market conditions, we may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts or, if we are able to, we may not be able to secure or improve existing dayrates or other material terms, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss, including weather-related risks, that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling industry, including environmental pollution, blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of or damage to the wellbore or underground reservoir, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental and natural resources damage and damage to the property of others. Our offshore operations involve the additional hazards of marine operations including pollution of coastal waters, damage to wildlife and natural habitats, capsizing, grounding, collision, damage from hurricanes and heavy weather or sea conditions, such as sea level rise, coastal storm surge, inland flooding, and unsound ocean bottom conditions.\nAccidents may occur, we may be unable to obtain desired contractual indemnities, and our insurance may prove inadequate in certain cases. The occurrence of an event for which we are not sufficiently insured or indemnified, or the failure or inability of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, insurance may not be available to cover certain risks. Our insurance also may not cover losses associated with pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Even if available, insurance may be inadequate or insurance premiums or other costs may increase significantly in the future, making insurance prohibitively expensive. We expect to continue facing upward pressure in our insurance renewals, our premiums and deductibles may be higher, and some insurance coverage may either be unavailable or more expensive than it has been in the past. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of a deductible or self-insured retention. We may choose to increase the levels of deductibles (and thus assume a greater degree of risk) from time to time in order to minimize our overall costs, which could exacerbate the effect of our losses on our financial condition and liquidity.\nOur drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated, suspended or terminated without an early termination payment.\nMost of our multi-well and term drilling contracts require that an early termination payment be made to us if a contract is terminated by the customer prior to its expiration. However, such payments may not fully compensate us for the loss of a contract. In certain circumstances, including but not limited to, non-performance caused by significant operational or equipment issues (such as destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time), sustained periods of downtime due to a force majeure event, or other events beyond our control or some other breach of our contractual obligations, our customers may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us at all. In addition, some contracts may be suspended, rather than terminated early, for an extended period of time, in some cases without adequate compensation. The early termination or suspension of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring periods of depressed market conditions, we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers (including government-controlled entities) seeking to renegotiate, repudiate or terminate their contracts and/or to otherwise exert commercial influence to our disadvantage. Downturns in the oil price environment may result in downward pricing pressure and decreased demand for our drilling services with existing customers, renegotiations of pricing and other terms in our drilling contracts with certain customers and early termination of contracts by others. Our customers\u2019 ability to perform their obligations under the contracts, including their ability to pay us or fulfill their indemnity obligations, may also be affected by an economic or industry downturn or other adverse conditions in the oil and gas industry. If we were to sustain a loss and our customers were unable to honor their indemnification and/or payment obligations, it could adversely affect our liquidity. If our customers cancel some of our contracts, and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and/or on substantially similar terms, or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time with or without adequate compensation or renegotiated with pricing or other terms less favorable to us, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of one or a number of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2021, 2020 and 2019, we received approximately 44%, 49% and 41%, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues from our three largest contract drilling customers (including their affiliates), with our largest customer and partner in our SANAD joint venture, Saudi Aramco, representing 31%, 29% and 22% of our consolidated operating revenues, respectively, for these periods. The loss of one or more of our larger customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, if a significant customer experiences liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties it may be unable to make required payments or seek to renegotiate contracts, which could adversely affect our liquidity and profitability. Financial difficulties experienced by customers could also adversely affect our utilization rates in the affected market and may cause our counterparties to seek modifications to our contracts with them. Furthermore, potential consolidation among oil and natural gas exploration and production companies may reduce the number of available customers.\nThe profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by war, civil disturbance, terrorist activity or other political or economic instability, fluctuation in currency exchange rates and local import and export controls.\nWe derive a significant portion of our business from global markets, including operations in the Middle East, South America, the Far East, North Africa, central and southern Asia, and Russia. These operations are subject to various risks, including war, civil disturbances, labor strikes, nationalization, terrorist activity and governmental actions that may limit or disrupt markets, restrict the movement of funds or result in limits or restrictions in our ability to operate or compete, the deprivation of contractual rights or the taking of property without fair compensation, particularly in respect of contracts with state-owned oil companies. In some countries, our operations may be subject to the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange controls. We also are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the operation and taxation of our business and the import and export of our equipment from country to country, the imposition, application and interpretation of which can prove to be uncertain.\nThe future occurrence of one or more international events arising from the types of risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, components and parts used in rig operations, conversions, upgrades and construction.\nOur reliance on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to provide equipment and services exposes us to volatility in the quality, price and availability of such items. Certain components, parts and equipment that we use in our operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers. The failure of one or more third-party suppliers, manufacturers or service providers to provide equipment, components, parts or services, whether due to capacity constraints, labor shortages or other labor-related difficulties, production or delivery disruptions, price increases, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment, is beyond our control and could materially disrupt our operations or result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of drilling contracts, thereby causing a loss of contract drilling backlog and/or revenues to us, as well as an increase in operating costs.\nAdditionally, our suppliers, manufacturers, and service providers could be negatively affected by changes in industry conditions or global economic conditions. If certain of our suppliers, manufacturers or service providers were to curtail or discontinue their business as a result of such conditions, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or equipment available to us and/or a significant increase in the price of such supplies and equipment, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur contracts with state-owned energy companies may expose us to greater risks than we normally assume in contracts with non-governmental customers.\nWe currently own and operate rigs and rig-related equipment under contracts with state-owned energy companies (\u201cNOCs\u201d). In the future, we may expand our international solutions operations and enter into additional, significant contracts with NOCs. The terms of these contracts may contain non-negotiable provisions and may expose us to greater commercial, political, operational and other risks than we assume in other contracts. These contracts may expose us to materially greater environmental liability and other claims for damages (including consequential damages) and personal injury related to our operations, or the risk that the contract may be terminated by our customer without cause on short-term notice, contractually or by governmental action, or under certain conditions that may not provide us with an early termination payment. We can provide no assurance that increased risk exposure will not have an adverse effect on our future operations or that we will not increase the number of rigs contracted, or the amount of technology deployed, to NOCs with commensurate additional contractual risks. Risks that accompany contracts with NOCs could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nControl of oil and natural gas reserves by NOCs may affect the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations.\nMuch of the world\u2019s oil and natural gas reserves are controlled by NOCs, which may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards, such as conducting our operations through joint ventures with local partners that could be difficult or undesirable for us to meet. The failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely affect our operations in those countries. In addition, our ability to work with NOCs is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms.\nOur operating expense includes fixed costs that may not decline in proportion to decreases in rig utilization and dayrates.\nOur operating expense includes all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation, maintenance and support of our drilling and related equipment, many of which are not affected by changes in dayrates and some of which are not affected by utilization. During periods of reduced revenues and/or activity, certain of our fixed costs (such as depreciation) may not decline and often we may incur additional costs. During times of reduced utilization, reductions in costs may not be immediate as we may not be able to fully reduce the cost of our support operations in a particular geographic region due to the need to support the remaining drilling rigs in that region. Accordingly, a decline in revenues due to lower dayrates and/or utilization may not be offset by a corresponding decrease in drilling services and solutions expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nActions of and disputes with our joint venture partners could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and consolidated results of operations.\nWe conduct some operations through joint ventures. As with any joint venture arrangement, differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions, the joint venture operating in a manner that is contrary to our preference or in failures to agree on major issues. We also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners, including any nonperformance, default, or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners. These factors could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and consolidated results of operations.\nFailure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other strategic transactions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.\nWe undertake from time to time acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures, alliances and other strategic transactions that we expect to further our business objectives. For example, in October 2016, we announced an agreement to form a new joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which commenced operations in December 2017. The long-term success of the Saudi joint venture depends, to a large degree, on the satisfactory performance of our joint venture partner\u2019s obligations, including contributions of capital, drilling rigs and related equipment, and our ability to maintain an effective, working relationship with our joint venture partner.\nWe also completed the acquisition of Tesco in December 2017. We have been unable to obtain regulatory approvals to recognize our acquisition of the Tesco subsidiary in Russia.\nThe anticipated benefits of the Saudi joint venture, the Tesco acquisition, and other strategic transactions may not be fully realized, or may be realized more slowly than expected, and may result in operational and financial consequences, including, but not limited to, the loss of key customers, suppliers or employees, or the disposition of certain assets or operations, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDecisions by internet service, cloud host service and related providers to restrict or ban our ability to use their platforms could adversely affect our ability to promote and conduct our business and inform investors.\nWe utilize the internet to provide services and to promote our business and services to current and potential customers and to provide information and updates to our investors. Internet service providers, cloud hosting services, social media companies and website providers that currently allow us to utilize their platforms to communicate with customers and the public may decide that our business or the industry in which we operate negatively affects their business or may make business decisions or changes to their policies that negatively affect us. Such actions could include placing restrictions on our use of their platforms or banning us from utilizing their services altogether. Our inability to use these platforms may have a negative effect on the way we are perceived in the industry or in the media and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe will be subject to a number of uncertainties during the timeframe when Nabors Energy Transition Corporation (NETC) pursues a business combination, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and share price.\nIf NETC is unable to consummate a suitable business transaction during the prescribed time period set forth in the terms of the initial public offering, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our shareholders. In addition, in the event that NETC is able to find a suitable business combination, or if the business combination is unsuccessful, there is no assurance that we will realize the anticipated value from such transaction.\nFinancial Risks\nWe may record additional losses or impairment charges related to sold or idle drilling rigs and other assets.\nIn 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized impairment charges of $60.5 million, $390.0 million and $290.5 million, respectively, related to tangible assets and equipment. Prolonged periods of low utilization or low dayrates, the cold stacking of idle assets, the sale of assets below their then-carrying value or the decline in market value of our assets may cause us to experience further losses. If future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at\nthe time, including oil and gas prices and expected utilization levels, indicate that the carrying value of any of our rigs may not be recoverable or if we sell assets for less than their then carrying value, we may recognize additional impairment charges on our fleet.\nOur financial and operating flexibility could be affected by our long-term debt and other financial commitments.\nThe 2018 Revolving Credit Facility (as hereinafter defined) was fully refinanced by the 2022 Credit Agreement (as hereinafter defined) on January 21, 2022. The 2022 Credit Agreement is secured with a first lien security interest on all land drilling rigs and related equipment, spare parts and inventory in the contiguous U.S. Under the facility, we are required to maintain an \u201cinterest coverage ratio\u201d of no less than 1.75:1.00 as of the last day of the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2022, with such ratio periodically increasing in increments of 0.125:1.00 to a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.75:1.00 as of the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024. We are also required to maintain a \u201cminimum guarantor value\u201d of no less than 90% at all times. The interest coverage ratio is defined to mean the ratio of (i) EBITDA for the latest four fiscal quarters for which financial statements are required to have been delivered to (ii) the interest expense for the latest four fiscal quarters for which financial statements are required to have been delivered. The minimum guarantor value is defined to mean the percentage of book value of, minus depreciation and amortization on, property, plant and equipment owned by Nabors and its subsidiaries, that is directly or indirectly owned by the guarantors of the 2022 Credit Agreement (other than Nabors) and their wholly owned subsidiaries. The interest coverage ratio and the minimum guarantor value requirement are not measures of operating performance or liquidity defined by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our consolidated total outstanding indebtedness was $3.3 billion. We also have various financial commitments, such as leases, contracts and purchase commitments. Our ability to service our debt and other financial obligations depends in large part upon the level of cash flows generated by our operating subsidiaries\u2019 operations, our ability to monetize and/or divest non-core assets, availability under the 2022 Credit Agreement and our ability to access the capital markets and/or other sources of financing. If we cannot repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or reduce funding in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, any of which could negatively affect our stock price or financial condition.\nOur ability to access capital markets could be limited.\nFrom time to time, we may need to access capital markets to obtain long-term and short-term financing. However, our ability to access capital markets could be limited or adversely affected by, among other things, oil and gas prices, our existing capital structure, our credit ratings, interest rates and the health or market perceptions of the drilling and overall oil and gas industry and the global economy. In addition, many of the factors that affect our ability to access capital markets, including the liquidity of the overall capital markets, the state of the economy and/or the oil and gas industry, and the impact of COVID-19, among others, are outside of our control. There have also been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities as well as pressuring lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves, which, if successful, could limit our ability to access capital markets. No assurance can be given that we will be able to access capital markets on terms acceptable to us when required to do so, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA downgrade in our credit rating could negatively affect our cost of and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources.\nOur ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing may be affected by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by major U.S. credit rating agencies. Factors that may affect our credit ratings include debt levels, asset purchases or sales, as well as near-term and long-term growth opportunities and industry conditions. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, market diversity, and commodity pricing levels and other factors, including the impact of COVID-19, are also considered by the rating agencies. Our senior unsecured debt has a non-investment grade rating. Ratings downgrades may affect our cost of capital and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTechnology Risks\nNew technologies may cause our drilling methods and equipment to become less competitive and it may become necessary to incur higher levels of operating and capital expenditures in order to keep pace with the disruptive trends in the drilling industry. Growth through the building of new drilling rigs and improvement of existing rigs is not assured.\nThe market for our services is characterized by continual technological developments that have resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, substantial improvements in the functionality and performance of rigs and equipment. Our customers increasingly demand the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs and related equipment. Accordingly, we may have to allocate a higher proportion of our capital expenditures to maintain and improve existing rigs and other equipment, purchase and construct newer, higher specification drilling rigs and other equipment to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers and develop new and improved technology and data analytics.\nAlthough we take measures to ensure that we develop and use advanced oil and natural gas drilling technology, changes in technology or improvements by competitors could make our equipment less competitive. There can be no assurance that we will:\n\u25cf have sufficient capital resources to improve existing rigs or build new, technologically advanced drilling rigs;\n\u25cf avoid cost overruns inherent in large fabrication projects resulting from numerous factors such as shortages or unscheduled delays in delivery of equipment or materials, inadequate levels of skilled labor, unanticipated increases in costs of equipment, materials and labor, design and engineering problems, and financial or other difficulties;\n\u25cf successfully deploy idle, stacked, new or upgraded drilling rigs;\n\u25cf effectively manage the size or growth of our organization and drilling fleet;\n\u25cf maintain crews necessary to operate existing or additional drilling rigs; or\n\u25cf successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of improving existing drilling rigs or building new drilling rigs.\nIn the event that we are successful in developing new technologies for use in our business, there is no guarantee of future demand for those technologies. Customers may be reluctant or unwilling to adopt our new technologies. We may also have difficulty negotiating satisfactory terms for our technology services or may be unable to secure prices sufficient to obtain expected returns on our investment in the research and development of new technologies.\nDevelopment of new technology is critical to maintaining our competitiveness. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop technology that our customers demand. If we are not successful keeping pace with technological advances and trends (including trends in favor of emissions-reducing technologies) or if we fail to deliver such technologies to our customers in a timely and cost-effective manner suitable to their needs, demand for our services could decline and we could lose market share. Furthermore, if our equipment or proprietary technologies become obsolete, the value of our intellectual property may be reduced, or one or more technologies that we may implement in the future may not work as we expect and our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected as a result. Additionally, new technologies, services or standards could render some of our services, drilling rigs or equipment obsolete, which could reduce our competitiveness and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLimitations on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenues and any competitive advantage we hold.\nThere can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights will be adequate. Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending, or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected when our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our\ntechnology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Patent protection on some types of technology, such as software or machine learning processes, may not be available in certain countries in which we operate. Our competitors may also be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTechnology disputes could negatively affect our operations or increase our costs.\nOur services and products use proprietary technology and equipment, which can involve potential infringement of a third party\u2019s rights, or a third party\u2019s infringement of our rights, including patent rights. The majority of the intellectual property rights relating to our drilling rigs and related services are owned by us or certain of our supplying vendors. However, in the event that we or one of our customers or supplying vendors becomes involved in a dispute over infringement of intellectual property rights relating to equipment or technology owned or used by us, services performed by us or products provided by us, we may lose access to important equipment or technology or our ability to provide services or products, or we could be required to cease use of some equipment or technology or be forced to invest or develop replacement technologies to enhance our equipment, technology, services or products. We could also be required to pay license fees or royalties for the use of equipment or technology or provision of services or products. In addition, we may lose a competitive advantage in the event we are unsuccessful in enforcing our rights against third parties. Regardless of the merits, any such claims generally result in significant legal and other costs, including reputational harm, and may distract management from running our business. Technology disputes involving us or our customers or supplying vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nImprovements in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSince our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, any improvement in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies that increase the use of alternative forms of energy and reduce the demand for oil and natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nNew and evolving regulations in the countries in which we operate (including the United States) concerning health and safety related to COVID-19 could have a material effect on our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused governments across the globe to implement laws and restrictions aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 and ensuring the safety of their citizens. In the United States, the federal government issued a vaccination mandate covering federal contractors (Executive Order 14042), and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) announced the implementation of the Vaccination and Testing Emergency Temporary Standard (the \u201cETS\u201d), requiring all employers with at least 100 employees to ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated or require unvaccinated workers to obtain a COVID-19 test at least once a week. The Supreme Court enjoined the ETS on January 13, 2022, after which, effective January 26, 2022, OSHA withdrew the measure. OSHA continues to pursue imposition of a similar, permanent requirement through the rulemaking process. This process is not complete and, as such, the final form of OSHA\u2019s rule regarding workplace vaccinations is not known. Executive Order 14042 is currently enjoined by court orders, and the ultimate outcome of such litigation is not known. Therefore, it is not clear at this time how either OSHA\u2019s rule or Executive Order 14042, if enforced, may affect our workforce and our ability to maintain our operations throughout the United States.\nSimilarly, laws in other jurisdictions where we operate require individuals to demonstrate proof of vaccination, negative COVID-19 tests, or have other requirements intended to halt or slow the spread of COVID-19, and may restrict travel to, through, and/or from such countries. These travel restrictions may significantly affect our global workforce. If our employees are not able to provide evidence consistent with local requirements and are not allowed to travel to the work location, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur international business exposes us to additional risks, including risks related to geopolitical and economic factors, laws and regulations, and compliance obligations and risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable anti-corruption laws. Violations of these laws could have a negative effect on our business.\nOur international business (including our participation in joint ventures, requirements for local content, and our global supply chain) is subject to numerous political and economic factors, legal requirements, cross-cultural considerations and other risks associated with doing business globally. Our international business is generally subject to both U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, laws and regulations relating to export/import controls, sanctions, technology transfers, government contracts and procurement, data privacy and protection, investment, exchange rates and controls, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), the Bermuda Bribery Act (2016) and other anti-corruption laws, anti-boycott provisions, securities laws, labor and employment, works councils and other labor groups, anti-human trafficking, taxes, environment, immunity, security restrictions and intellectual property. The SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have continued to focus on enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. While our employees and agents are required to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws, and we have adopted policies and procedures and related training programs designed to promote and achieve compliance, we cannot ensure that our internal policies, procedures and programs will always protect us from risks associated with unlawful acts carried out by our employees or agents.\nFailure by us, our employees, affiliates, partners or others with whom we work to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, commercial or criminal liabilities, including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export/import privileges. Any such penalty could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nChanges to or noncompliance with laws and regulations or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.\nDrilling of oil and natural gas wells is subject to various laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate, including comprehensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health, including those regulating the spill, release, transport, storage, use, treatment, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and solid wastes and materials. Our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may be substantial. Violation of environmental laws or regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, capital expenditures, delays in the permitting or performance of projects, and in some cases injunctive relief. Violations may also result in liabilities for personal injuries, property and natural resource damage and other costs and claims. We are not able to allocate all risks of environmental liabilities to customers, and it is possible that customers who assume the risks will be financially unable to bear any resulting costs.\nIn addition, U.S. federal laws and the laws of other jurisdictions regulate the prevention of oil spills and the release of hazardous substances and may impose liability for removal costs and natural resource, real or personal property and certain economic damages arising from any spills. Some of these laws may impose strict and/or joint and several liability for clean-up costs and damages without regard to the conduct of the parties. As an owner and operator of onshore and offshore rigs and other equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under federal law. In addition, we are subject to various laws governing the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials and the use of underground storage tanks.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations may also negatively affect the operations of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, which in turn could have an adverse effect on us. Future or more stringent federal or state regulation could dramatically increase operating costs for oil and natural gas companies, curtail production and demand for oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and reduce the market for our services by making wells and/or oilfields uneconomical to operate, which may in turn adversely affect results of operations.\nThe physical effects of climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change could have a negative effect on our business.\nThere has been an increasing focus of international, national, state, regional and local regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d), including carbon dioxide and methane, emissions and climate change issues. Future regulation could require industries to meet stringent standards to substantially reduce GHG emissions. Legislation to regulate GHG\nemissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress. In addition, the current administration has taken steps to further regulate GHG emissions. Those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) has published findings that GHG emissions present an endangerment to public health and the environment. The EPA has also issued rules requiring monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector, including onshore and offshore production activities. In November 2021, the EPA proposed new rules aimed at sharply reducing methane and other emissions from new and existing sources in the oil and gas industry. The Bureau of Land Management also issued a rule in November 2016 requiring reductions in methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaking activities on public lands.\nThe United States is a member of the Paris Agreement, a climate accord reached at the Conference of the Parties (\u201cCOP 21\u201d) in Paris, that set many new goals, and many related policies are still emerging. The Paris Agreement requires set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. Stronger GHG emission targets were set at the Conference of Parties in Glasgow (\u201cCOP 26\u201d) in November 2021.\nIt is not possible to predict the timing and effect of climate change or whether additional GHG regulations will be adopted. However, more aggressive efforts by governments and non-governmental organizations to reduce GHG emissions appear likely, and any such future regulations could result in increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions or affect the demand for our customers\u2019 products and, accordingly, our services.\nIn addition, there have been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Further, members of the investment community have increased their focus on sustainability practices with regard to the oil and gas industry, including practices related to GHGs and climate change, and an increasing number of our customers consider sustainability factors in awarding work. These developments, and public perception relating to climate change, may curtail production and demand for oil and natural gas by shifting demand towards lower carbon energy sources such as wind, solar and other renewables. If these efforts are successful, our ability and the ability of our customers to access capital markets may be limited and our stock price may be negatively affected.\nBeyond financial and regulatory effects, the projected severe effects of climate change have the potential to directly affect our facilities and operations and those of our customers.\nLegal proceedings and governmental investigations could affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time that include employment, tort, intellectual property and other claims, and purported class action and shareholder derivative actions. We are also subject to complaints and allegations from former, current or prospective employees from time to time, alleging violations of employment-related laws or other whistle blower-related matters. Lawsuits or claims could result in decisions against us that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d for a discussion of certain existing legal proceedings.\nWe may be subject to changes in tax laws and have additional tax liabilities.\nWe operate through various subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world. Consequently, we are subject to changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations and the interpretation or enforcement thereof in the United States and in jurisdictions in which we or any of our subsidiaries operate or are organized, and any such changes could have a material effect on our results of operations in the periods in which such laws and regulations become effective as well as in future periods. In October 2021, the Group of 20 endorsed a new global minimum tax rate for large multinational companies, which also has the support of a large number of countries and territories responsible for the overwhelming majority of global economic output. To take effect, the minimum tax would need to be implemented by each jurisdiction. It is not yet clear how such a minimum tax would impact our business.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cTax Reform Act\u201d) adopted sweeping changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code which also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition to lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate and numerous other changes, the law imposes more stringent limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and net operating losses and imposes a type of minimum tax designed to reduce the\nbenefits derived from intercompany transactions and payments that result in base erosion. Tax laws, treaties and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation. Our income tax expense is based upon our interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense is incurred. Although the Tax Reform Act has not had a material effect on our financial statements to date, if these tax laws, treaties or regulations change or any tax authority successfully challenges our assessment of the effects of such laws, treaties and regulations in any country, including our operational structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our subsidiaries in certain countries, this could have a material adverse effect on us, resulting in a higher effective tax rate on our consolidated earnings or a reclassification of the tax effects of our significant corporate restructuring transactions.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards, and possibly other tax attributes, to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances, including future transactions involving the sale or issuance of Company equity securities, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company reported consolidated federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $728.6 million and certain other favorable federal income tax attributes. The Company\u2019s ability to use its NOL carryforwards and certain other attributes may be limited if it experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 (\u201cSection 382\u201d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). An ownership change generally occurs if there is a more than 50 percentage point increase in the aggregate equity ownership of the Company by one or more \u201c5 percent shareholders\u201d (as that term is defined for purposes of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code) in any testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding any potential ownership change, measured against their lowest percentage ownership at any time during such period.\nThere is no assurance that the Company will not experience an ownership change under Section 382 as a result of future actions that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its NOL carryforwards and potentially certain other tax attributes. Potential future transactions involving the sale, issuance, redemption or other disposition of common or preferred shares or other equity-based securities, the exercise of conversion or exchange options under the terms of any convertible or exchangeable debt, the repurchase of any such debt with Company shares, in each case, by a person owning, or treated as owning, 5% or more of the Company\u2019s shares, or a combination of such transactions, may cause or increase the possibility that the Company will experience an ownership change under Section 382. Under Section 382, an ownership change would subject the Company to an annual limitation that applies to the amount of pre-ownership change NOLs (and possibly certain other tax attributes) that may be used to offset post-ownership change taxable income. If a Section 382 limitation applies, the limitation could cause the Company\u2019s U.S. federal income taxes to be greater, or to be paid earlier, than they otherwise would be, and could cause all or a portion of the Company\u2019s NOL carryforwards to expire unused. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. The Company\u2019s ability to use its NOL carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods. The Company\u2019s NOL carryforwards may expire before it can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full.\nShare Capital and Corporate Structure Risks\nSignificant issuances of common shares could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\nAs of February 14, 2022, we had 32,000,000 authorized common shares, of which 9,661,352 shares were outstanding and entitled to vote, including 1,090,003 million held by our subsidiaries. In addition, 350,067 common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to stock option and employee benefit plans. The sale, or availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, whether directly by us or resulting from the exercise of options or warrants (and, where applicable, sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act) or the exchange of our 0.75% Exchangeable Notes due 2024, would be dilutive to existing shareholders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities.\nOur common share price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common shares has fluctuated in the past and is subject to significant fluctuations in response to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u25cf variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf deviations in our earnings from publicly disclosed forward-looking guidance;\n\u25cf variability in our revenues;\n\u25cf our announcements of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures;\n\u25cf general conditions in and market perceptions of the oil and gas industry;\n\u25cf uncertainty about current global economic conditions;\n\u25cf fluctuations in stock market price and volume; and\n\u25cf other general economic conditions.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our markets or our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts, and we cannot provide any assurance that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price could materially decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our Company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to materially decline.\nDuring 2021, our stock price on the NYSE ranged from a high of $130.49 per common share to a low of $57.34 per common share. In recent years, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for many companies in industries similar to ours. Some of these fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. These market fluctuations may decrease the market price of our common shares in the future.\nProvisions in our organizational documents may be insufficient to thwart a coercive hostile takeover attempt; conversely, these provisions and those in our outstanding debt and Saudi joint venture documents may deter a change of control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium.\nCompanies generally seek to prevent coercive takeovers by parties unwilling to pay fair value for the enterprise they acquire. Provisions in our organizational documents that are meant to help us avoid a coercive takeover include:\n\u25cf Authorizing our board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) to issue a significant number of common shares and up to 25,000,000 preferred shares, as well as to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of the preferred shares, in each case without any vote or action by the holders of our common shares;\n\u25cf Limiting the ability of our shareholders to call or bring business before special meetings;\n\u25cf Prohibiting our shareholders from taking action by written consent in lieu of a meeting unless the consent is signed by all the shareholders then entitled to vote;\n\u25cf Requiring advance notice of shareholder proposals for business to be conducted at general meetings and for nomination of candidates for election to our Board; and\n\u25cf Reserving to our Board the ability to determine the number of directors comprising the full Board and to fill vacancies or newly created seats on the Board.\nCertain actions taken by us could make it easier for another party to acquire control of the Company. For instance, in June 2012 we adopted an amendment to our bye-laws to declassify the Board and in 2017, as recommended by our shareholders, we amended our policy regarding nomination and proxy access for director candidates. Conversely, the provisions designed to prevent hostile takeovers, or protect holders of our debt instruments and our joint venture partner,\nmay deter transactions in which shareholders would receive a change of control premium. For example, certain change of control transactions could accelerate the principal amounts outstanding, and require premiums payments, under our debt instruments, or trigger a call option to purchase our interest in SANAD, our joint venture with Saudi Aramco.\nAs a holding company, we depend on our operating subsidiaries and investments to meet our financial obligations.\nWe are a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries. In order to meet our financial needs and obligations, we rely exclusively on repayments of interest and principal on intercompany loans that we have made to operating subsidiaries, and income from dividends and other cash flow from such subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that such operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient net income to pay dividends or sufficient cash flow to make payments of interest and principal to us in respect of intercompany loans. In addition, from time to time, such operating subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements that contractually restrict or prohibit these types of upstream payments. Our debt instruments do not contain covenants prohibiting any such contractual restrictions. There may also be adverse tax consequences associated with such operating subsidiaries paying dividends. Finally, the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us may be restricted by the laws of the applicable subsidiaries\u2019 jurisdictions of organization and other laws and regulations. If subsidiaries are unable to distribute or otherwise make payments to us, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on obligations when due, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary funds from other sources.\nGeneral Risks\nInvestor sentiment and public perception related to the fossil fuels industry and to ESG initiatives could increase our costs of capital, our reporting requirement, and our operations, which could negatively affect our stock price.\nWe are a service provider to energy companies in the fossil fuel industry. Investor sentiment and public perception of fossil fuels have led to calls to limit investment and lending to businesses in this industry. If any of these efforts continue or increase, our ability to raise capital could be negatively affected, which could lead to a reduction in our stock price.\nSimilarly, there are calls by certain investors for companies to increase their environment, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) initiatives, and for more robust reporting on such initiatives. The European Union has implemented ESG reporting requirements on EU market participants, and similar regulations are pending in various states in the United States. Members of the investment community and lenders have also begun establishing standards required of companies in which they invest or to which they provide credit. We anticipate these reporting requirements will continue and potentially increase. Increased ESG efforts and reporting requirements may increase our costs of operations and thereby negatively affect our financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to meet the requirements of our investors or our lenders, our cost of capital may increase and our stock price may be negatively affected.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19, and future adverse effects could be material and difficult to predict.\nThe global spread of the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19 and its variants, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, has adversely affected our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers. The outbreak triggered a sharp sell-off in energy commodities markets during the first quarter of 2020, as economic activity tumbled as a result of government impositions of mandatory closures, quarantines and other restrictions on, or advisories with respect to, travel, business operations and public gatherings or interactions. Certain jurisdictions recently have begun re-opening only to return to restrictions in the face of increases in new COVID-19 cases, while other jurisdictions are continuing to re-open or have nearly completed the re-opening process despite increases in COVID-19 cases. The pandemic may significantly worsen during the upcoming months, which may cause governmental authorities to reconsider restrictions on business, travel, and other activities.\nThe significant weakness in oil and natural gas prices resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in sharp reductions in the exploration and production capital and operating budgets of our customers. Demand for our services and associated product offerings, and the rates we are able to charge to customers, is closely tied to such exploration and production activities and the significant price weakness and associated volatility surrounding these events has had, and is likely to continue to have, an adverse effect on the demand for our services.\nFuture increases in commodity prices may not necessarily translate into the resumption of exploration and production activities (and a corresponding demand for our services) because our customers\u2019 expectations of future prices may also influence or limit their activity. As a result of these factors, lower demand for drilling and drilling related services may persist for a significant time, which would continue to materially adversely affect the rates that we are able to charge our customers and the demand for our services.\nThe spread of the virus into our workforce may also prevent us from meeting the demands of our customers in the future. For example, if the COVID-19 pandemic were to significantly affect a location where we have a high concentration of business and resources, our local workforce could be affected by the outbreak, which could significantly disrupt our operations or lead to a shutdown of operations in that location.\nOur business is subject to cybersecurity risks.\nOur operations are increasingly dependent on information technologies and services. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow, and include, among other things, storms and natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages, theft, viruses, phishing, malware, design defects, human error, and complications encountered as existing systems are maintained, repaired, replaced, or upgraded. Risks associated with these threats include, among other things:\n\u25cf theft or misappropriation of funds;\n\u25cf loss, corruption, or misappropriation of intellectual property, or other proprietary, confidential or personally identifiable information (including customer, supplier, or employee data);\n\u25cf disruption or impairment of our and our customers\u2019 business operations and safety procedures;\n\u25cf damage to our reputation with our customers and the market;\n\u25cf the perception of our products or services as having security vulnerabilities;\n\u25cf exposure to litigation and legal and regulatory costs;\n\u25cf loss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems; and\n\u25cf increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.\nAlthough we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cybersecurity attacks and other cyber events are evolving and unpredictable. Moreover, we have no control over the information technology systems of our customers, suppliers, and others with which our systems may connect and communicate. As a result, the occurrence of a cyber incident could go unnoticed for a period time.\nWe do not presently maintain insurance coverage to protect against cybersecurity risks. If we procure such coverage in the future, we cannot ensure that it will be sufficient to cover any particular losses we may experience as a result of such cyberattacks. Any cyber incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of key executives or inability to attract and retain experienced technical professionals and talented personnel could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success.\nThe successful execution of our business strategies depends, in part, on the continued service of certain key executive officers and employees. We have employment agreements with some of our key personnel within the company, but no assurance can be given that any employee will remain with us, whether or not they have entered into an employment agreement. We do not carry key man insurance. In addition, our operations depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced technical professionals and talented personnel. Competition for such professionals is intense, and as the business environment improves, competition for personnel generally intensifies. The loss of key executive officers and/or our inability to retain or attract experienced technical professionals and talented personnel,\ncould reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 29102, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "NBR"}
