You should carefully consider the risks described below. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The risks and factors listed below, however, are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K include additional factors that could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing environment. Other known risks that we currently believe to be immaterial could become material in the future. We also are subject to legal and regulatory changes. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nOur business depends on spending by the oil and natural gas industry in the United States, and this spending and our business has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by industry and financial market conditions that are beyond our control. A substantial or an extended decline in oil and natural gas prices could result in lower expenditures by our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on our customers\u2019 willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the United States. These expenditures are generally dependent on current oil and natural gas prices and the industry\u2019s view of future oil and natural gas prices, including the industry\u2019s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Recent declines in oil and natural gas prices, and any substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices, could result in reductions in our customers\u2019 operating and capital expenditures. Declines in these expenditures could result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, delays in, or nonpayment of, amounts owed to us, increased exposure to credit risk and bad debts, and a general reduction in demand for our services. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIndustry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:\n\u2022\nthe domestic and worldwide price and supply of natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil, including the natural gas inventories and oil reserves of the United States;\n\u2022\nchanges in the level of consumer demand;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\nthe availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, other transportation facilities and processing facilities;\n\u2022\nthe level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including by commodity price speculators and others;\n\u2022\nthe nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022\nactions of the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or \"OPEC,\" relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\nthe level of excess production and projected rates of production growth;\n\u2022\npolitical instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; and\n\u2022\noverall domestic and global economic and market conditions.\nThe oil and gas industry is currently experiencing a downturn due to significant declines in oil and natural gas prices. Since the second half of 2014, oil prices have declined substantially from historic highs and may remain depressed for the foreseeable\nfuture. Historically, downturns in the industry have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices customers are willing to pay for services such as ours. An extended downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services as well as lower prices and operating margins, and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn the past, we have experienced periods of low demand and have incurred operating losses. In the future, we may not be able to achieve or maintain our profitability due to an inability to reduce costs, increase revenue, or reduce our debt obligations. Under such circumstances, we may incur further operating losses and experience negative operating cash flow.\nFuture charges due to possible impairments of assets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and stock price.\nAs discussed more fully in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\u201d included in Item 7 herein, during the year ended December 31, 2014 we recorded asset impairments totaling $416.4 million, including $112.4 million for the impairment of long-lived assets and $304.0 million for the impairment of goodwill. Additionally, as discussed in Note 20, we recorded asset impairments totaling $74.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as a component of \"Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\" in our consolidated statement of operations. If there is further deterioration in our business operations or prospects, our stock price, the broader economy or our industry, including further declines in oil and natural gas prices, the value of our long-lived assets and goodwill, or those we may acquire in the future, could decrease significantly and result in additional impairment and financial statement write-offs.\nThe testing of long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the composition of our reporting units; changes in economic, industry or market conditions; changes in business operations; changes in competition; changes in goodwill; or potential changes in the share price of our common stock and market capitalization. Changes in these factors, or differences in our actual performance compared with estimates of our future performance, could affect the fair value of long-lived assets and goodwill, which may result in further impairment charges. We perform the assessment of potential impairment at least annually, or more often if events and circumstances require.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2014, we completed the previously-announced organizational realignment of our shale solutions segment into three operating divisions, which we consider to be our new operating and reportable segments: (1) the Northeast Division comprising the Marcellus and Utica Shale areas, (2) the Southern Division comprising the Haynesville, Eagle Ford, Mississippian and Permian Basin Shale areas and (3) the Rocky Mountain Division comprising the Bakken Shale area. As part of this organizational realignment, we re-evaluated the goodwill of our reporting units, defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, for impairment. We determined that our reporting units are the same as our new operating and reportable segments. Previously, the shale solutions operating segment was comprised of the shale solutions (excluding AWS and Pipeline) reporting unit, the AWS reporting unit and the Pipeline reporting unit. Given the change in the composition of its reporting units, we were required to allocate our $408.7 million of goodwill on a relative fair value basis to the new reporting units.\nIn addition to the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of September 30, we test our goodwill and long-lived assets, including other identifiable intangible assets with useful lives, for impairment if and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill and/or long-lived assets may not be recoverable. During the quarter ended June 30, 2014, we considered a number of relevant factors which are potential indicators of impairment, including (among others) the potential impacts of the aforementioned organizational realignment of its continuing operations and our current and near-term financial results as well as the fact that the market price of our common stock, taking into consideration potential control premiums, has wavered above and below our book value since the third quarter of 2013, as previously disclosed in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Based on these factors, we were required to perform impairment tests to determine whether the carrying values are fully recoverable of both our long-lived assets and goodwill. We completed the review of our long-lived assets in the quarter ended September 30, 2014 and concluded the fair value of such assets exceeded their carrying values, thus no long-lived asset impairment was indicated.\nThe goodwill impairment test has two steps. The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill. During the three months ended September 30, 2014, we performed step one of the goodwill impairment test for each of our three new reporting units: the Northeast division, Southern division and Rocky Mountain division. To measure the fair value of each new reporting unit, we used a combination of the discounted cash flow method and the guideline public company method. Based\non the results of the step-one goodwill impairment review, we concluded the fair value of the Rocky Mountain\ndivision exceeded our carrying amount by approximately 14% and accordingly, the second step of the impairment test was not\nnecessary for this reporting unit. Conversely, we concluded the fair value of the Northeast and Southern reporting units were less than their carrying values thereby requiring us to proceed to the second step of the goodwill impairment test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test, used to measure the amount of the impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with its carrying amount. For both the Northeast and Southern reporting units, the carrying values of the re-allocated goodwill exceeded their implied fair values. Accordingly, we recognized a charge of $100.7 million ($66.9 million in the Southern division and $33.8 million in the Northeast division) during the three months ended September 30, 2014, which is characterized as \"Impairment of goodwill\" in our consolidated statement of operations.\nDue to the continued significant decline in oil and gas prices and the market price of our common stock during the three months ended December 31, 2014, we determined that these triggering events required us to complete further impairment tests. Long-lived assets were grouped at the basin level for purposes of assessing their recoverability as we concluded the basin level is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. In the Northeast division and Southern divisions, the undiscounted cash flows of the asset groups exceeded their carrying values; therefore, no impairment was indicated. In the Bakken Shale basin, the carrying value of the asset group exceeded its undiscounted cash flows indicating impairment which resulted in an impairment charge of $112.4 million related to the customer relationship intangible asset. Such amount is reported in \"Impairment of long-lived assets\" in our consolidated statement of operations. The Northeast division and Southern divisions had no goodwill balances; therefore, we performed step one of the goodwill impairment test only for the Rocky Mountain division. The Rocky Mountain division is comprised of the Rocky Mountain reporting unit. We used a combination of the discounted cash flow method and the guideline public company method to measure the fair value of the Rocky Mountain reporting unit. Based on the results of the step-one goodwill impairment review, we concluded the fair value of the Rocky Mountain division was less than its carrying value thereby requiring us to proceed to the second step of the goodwill impairment test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test, used to measure the amount of the impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with its carrying amount. The carrying value of the Rocky Mountain reporting unit goodwill exceeded its implied fair value and as such, we recognized a charge of $203.3 million during the three months ended December 31, 2014, which is characterized as \"Impairment of goodwill\" in our consolidated statement of operations.\nThe fair values of each of the reporting units as well as the related assets and liabilities utilized to determine the 2014 impairment were measured using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs as described in Note 11.\nWe believe the assumptions used in our discounted cash flow analysis are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the implied fair value of each reporting unit. We further believe the most significant assumption used in our analysis is the revenue growth as limited by oil and gas prices. However, we may not meet our revenue targets, working capital and capital investment requirements may be higher than forecast, changes in credit or equity markets may result in changes to our discount rate and general business conditions may result in changes to our terminal value assumptions for our reporting units.\nIn evaluating the reasonableness of our fair value estimates, we consider (among other factors) the relationship between our book value, the market price of our common stock and the fair value of our reporting units. At December 31, 2014 and March 13, 2015, the closing market prices of our common stock were $5.55 and $2.92 per share, respectively, compared to our book value per share of $5.56 as of December 31, 2014. If our book value per share were to continue to exceed our market price per share plus a control premium, in addition to continued downward pricing in services driven by oil and gas price depression, it would likely indicate the occurrence of events or changes that would cause us to perform additional impairment analyses which could result in further revisions to our fair value estimates. While we believe that our estimates of fair value are reasonable, we will continue to monitor and evaluate this relationship. Additionally, should actual results differ materially from our projections, additional impairment would likely result.\nShould the value of our long-lived assets and goodwill become further impaired, we would incur additional charges which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could result in us incurring additional net operating losses in future periods. We cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets. Any future determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of long-lived assets or goodwill, although not requiring any additional cash outlay, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and stock price.\nWe may not recognize the anticipated benefits from our sale of the industrial solutions division or any other divestitures we may pursue in the future.\nAs described in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein, in October 2013, our Board of Directors authorized commencement of a process for the sale of TFI, comprising our industrial solutions division. As disclosed on a Form 8-K filed with Securities and Exchange Commission on February 4, 2015, we entered into a material definitive agreement with Safety-Kleen pursuant to which Safety-Kleen will purchase TFI. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the\nrequisite government approvals and successfully close the sale of TFI. Additionally, we may evaluate other potential divestiture opportunities with respect to portions of our business from time to time, and may determine to proceed with a divestiture opportunity if and when we believe such opportunity is consistent with our business strategy and we would be able to realize value for our stockholders in so doing. Any divestiture, including the planned sale of TFI, could expose us to significant risks, including, without limitation, fees for legal and transaction-related services, diversion of management resources, transaction execution risks (including risks resulting from buyer financing and due diligence contingencies and other closing conditions), loss of key personnel and reduction in revenue. Further, as contemplated in the definitive agreement relating to the sale of TFI, we may be required to retain or indemnify a buyer against certain liabilities and obligations in connection with any such divestiture, and we may also become subject to third-party claims arising out of such divestiture. In addition, we may not achieve the expected price in such a transaction, which could result in additional losses being recorded. If we do not realize the expected strategic, economic or other benefits of any divestiture transaction, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The sale of TFI is subject to various third party consents. There can be no assurances that we will obtain any necessary consents of governmental authorities or other third parties, including consent of the lenders under our credit facility that might be required in order for us to sell TFI or effectuate any other divesture. The expected sale of TFI will take the form of a stock sale of TFI rather than a sale of TFI\u2019s assets which will result in a significant capital loss for tax purposes. The goodwill impairment charges recorded during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 did not result in a reduction of our tax basis in the stock of TFI. We will not be able to carry any recognized capital loss resulting from a sale of TFI stock back to prior years as we did not generate capital gains nor pay any federal tax during such prior carryback years. We also do not currently expect to have significant capital gains in the five succeeding carryforward tax years to offset the capital loss carryforward. Consequently, we expect that any deferred tax asset resulting from a capital loss generated from the sale of TFI stock will require a valuation allowance.\nIf we are unable to consummate the divestiture of TFI for any reason, our business would be adversely impacted, including our cash flows, and, in addition, we would be subject to the risks associated with the continued operation of TFI\u2019s business, including (without limitation) operational, financial, legal, environmental and regulatory and compliance risks, any or all of which could be material to our business.\nWe may not be able to grow successfully through future acquisitions or successfully manage future growth, and we may not be able to effectively integrate the businesses we do acquire.\nWe have historically grown through strategic acquisitions of other businesses. We may not be able to continue to identify attractive acquisition opportunities or successfully acquire those opportunities identified. In order to complete acquisitions, we would expect to require additional debt and/or equity financing, which could increase our interest expense, leverage and/or shares outstanding (see \"Risks Related to Our Indebtedness\"). Businesses that we acquire, or have previously acquired, may not perform as expected. Future revenues, profits and cash flows of an acquired business may not materialize due to the failure or inability to capture expected synergies, increased competition, regulatory issues, changes in market conditions, or other factors beyond our control. In addition, we may not be successful in integrating future acquisitions into our existing operations, which may result in unforeseen operational difficulties or diminished financial performance or require a disproportionate amount of our management\u2019s attention.\nEven if we are successful in integrating our current or future acquisitions into our existing operations, we may not derive the benefits, such as operational or administrative synergies or earnings gains, that we expected from such acquisitions, which may result in the commitment of our capital resources without the expected returns on such capital. Also, competition for acquisition opportunities may escalate, increasing our cost of making further acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making additional acquisitions. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe potential disruption of our existing businesses;\n\u2022\nentering new markets or industries in which we have limited prior experience;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating and retaining key management, sales, research and development, production and other personnel or diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns to integration matters;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating or expanding information technology systems and other business processes or administrative infrastructures to accommodate the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing the combined businesses and consolidating multiple physical locations;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems; and\n\u2022\nwhether any necessary additional debt or equity financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and the impact of such financing on our operating performance and results of operations.\nWe depend on the continued service of Mark D. Johnsrud, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and other senior management.\nOur success is largely dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our people and, in particular, the continued services of Mr. Johnsrud, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. The loss of the services of Mr. Johnsrud, or of other members of our senior management, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and future growth, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any such departure could be viewed in a negative light by investors and analysts, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline. We do not carry key-person life insurance on any of our senior management.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mark D. Johnsrud, owns a significant amount of our voting stock and may have interests that differ from other shareholders. Mr. Johnsrud, as a significant shareholder, may, therefore, take actions that are not in the interest of other shareholders.\nMark D. Johnsrud, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, owns shares representing approximately 37% of our common stock as of December 31, 2014, and, therefore, he has significant control on the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of shareholders, including, but not limited to, electing directors, adopting amendments to our certificate of incorporation and approving corporate transactions. In addition, Mr. Johnsrud, as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, has the power to exert significant influence over our corporate management and policies. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of Mr. Johnsrud, as a significant shareholder, could be in conflict with the interests of other shareholders, and Mr. Johnsrud would have significant influence to cause us to take actions that align with his interests. Should conflicts of interest arise, we can provide no assurance that Mr. Johnsrud would act in the best interests of our other shareholders or that any conflicts of interest would be resolved in a manner favorable to our other shareholders.\nThe litigation environment in which we operate poses a significant risk to our businesses.\nWe are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, and environmental issues, other claims for injuries and damages, and various shareholder and class action litigation, among other matters. We may experience negative outcomes in such lawsuits in the future. Any such negative outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. We evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves and disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from such assessments and estimates. The settlement or resolution of such claims or proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, judges and juries in certain jurisdictions in which we conduct business have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage and other tort cases. We use appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against us, but the litigation environment in these areas poses a significant business risk to us and could cause a significant diversion of management resources and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLitigation related to personal injury from the operation of our business may result in significant liabilities and limit our profitability.\nThe hazards and risks associated with the transport, storage, and handling, treatment and disposal of our customers\u2019 waste (such as fires, spills, explosions and accidents) may expose us to personal injury claims, property damage claims and/or products liability claims from our customers or third parties. As protection against such claims and operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses. However, we may sustain losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks, or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. As more fully described in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein, due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these claims and lawsuits, and we may be held liable for significant personal injury or damage to property or third parties, or other losses, that are not fully covered by our insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSignificant capital expenditures are required to conduct our business.\nThe development of our business and services, excluding acquisition activities, requires substantial capital expenditures. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we made capital expenditures of approximately $55.7 million, primarily involving the\ncompletion of construction of the initial cells of our oilfield waste landfill in the Bakken Shale area and construction and development costs relating to our solids treatment capabilities, also in the Bakken Shale area. We continue to focus on improving the utilization of our existing assets and optimizing the allocation of resources in the various shale areas in which we operate. Our capital expenditure program is subject to market conditions, including customer activity levels, commodity prices, industry capacity and specific customer needs. In addition to capital expenditures required to maintain our current level of business activity, we may incur capital expenditures to support future growth of our business. We may also incur additional capital expenditures for acquisitions. We currently plan to reduce our level of capital expenditures for 2015, due in part to the ongoing declines in oil and natural gas prices and the corresponding effect on the oil and natural gas industry. Prolonged reductions or delays in capital expenditures could delay or diminish future cash flows and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our planned capital expenditures for 2015, as well as any acquisitions we choose to pursue, will likely be financed through a combination of existing asset sales, cash on hand, cash flow from operations, borrowings under our available credit facilities and capital leases, and, in the case of larger acquisitions, possible issuances of new debt and/or equity. We may also incur additional indebtedness to support growth initiatives. Future cash flows from operations are subject to a number of risks and variables, such as the level of drilling activity and oil and natural gas production of our customers, prices of natural gas and oil, and the other risk factors discussed herein. Our ability to obtain capital from other sources, such as the capital markets, is dependent upon many of those same factors as well as the orderly functioning of credit and capital markets. To the extent we fail to have adequate funds, we could be required to reduce or defer our capital spending, or pursue other funding alternatives which may not be as economically attractive to us, which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe compensation we offer our drivers is subject to market conditions, and we may find it necessary to increase driver compensation and/or modify the benefits provided to our employees in future periods.\nWe employed approximately 1,300 truck drivers as of December 31, 2014. Maintaining a staff of qualified truck drivers is critical to the success of our operations. We and other companies in the oil and gas industry suffer from a high turnover rate of drivers. The high turnover rate requires us to continually recruit a substantial number of drivers in order to operate existing equipment. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified drivers, we could be forced to, among other things, increase driver compensation and/or modify our benefit packages, or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting customer demands, any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability. Additionally, in anticipation of or in response to geographical and market-related fluctuations in the demand for our services, we strategically relocate our equipment and personnel from one area to another, which may result in operating inefficiencies, increased labor, fuel and other operating costs and could adversely affect our growth and profitability. As a result, our driver and employee training and orientation costs could be negatively impacted. We also utilize the services of independent contractor truck drivers to supplement our trucking capacity in certain shale areas on an as-needed basis. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into these types of arrangements on favorable terms, or that there will be sufficient qualified independent contractors available to meet our needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the supply of critical infrastructure assets, in particular employee housing in the Bakken Shale area, is limited. There is a shortage of fixed housing in the region, making it difficult for energy services operators and other businesses to attract quality, long-term personnel. Through an entity he controls, but which is separate from the Company, Mr. Johnsrud owns fixed-housing rental units in the Bakken Shale area. However, there is no formal arrangement with Mr. Johnsrud to ensure that our employees will be able to rent this housing. There can be no assurance that there will be sufficient housing available for all of our employees in the Bakken Shale area, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to provide services.\nWe depend on certain key customers for a significant portion of our revenues. The loss of any of these key customers or the loss of any contracted volumes could result in a decline in our business.\nWe rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues. Our three largest customers represented 15%, 10% and 10%, respectively, of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 and in total equaled 30% of the Company\u2019s consolidated accounts receivable at December 31, 2014. The loss of all, or even a portion, of the revenues from these customers, as a result of competition, market conditions or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. A reduction in exploration, development and production activities by key customers due to the current declines in oil and natural gas prices, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCustomer payment delays of outstanding receivables could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nWe often provide credit to our customers for our services, and are therefore subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay outstanding invoices. In weak economic environments, customers\u2019 delays and failures to pay often increase due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers\u2019 cash flow from operations and their access to credit markets. If our customers delay or fail to pay a significant amount of outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe fees charged to customers under our agreements with them may not escalate sufficiently to cover increases in costs and the agreements may be suspended in some circumstances, which would affect our profitability.\nUnder our agreements with our customers, we may be unable to increase the fees that we charge our customers at a rate sufficient to offset any increases in our costs. Additionally, some customers\u2019 obligations under their agreements with us may be permanently or temporarily reduced upon the occurrence of certain events, some of which are beyond our control, including force majeure events. Force majeure events may include (but are not limited to) events such as revolutions, wars, acts of enemies, embargoes, import or export restrictions, strikes, lockouts, fires, storms, floods, acts of God, explosions, mechanical or physical failures of our equipment or facilities of our customers. If the escalation of fees is insufficient to cover increased costs or if any customer suspends or terminates its contracts with us, the effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in competitive markets, and there can be no certainty that we will maintain our current customers or attract new customers or that our operating margins will not be impacted by competition.\nThe industries in which our business operates are highly competitive. We compete with numerous local and regional companies of varying sizes and financial resources. Competition could intensify in the future. Furthermore, numerous well-established companies are focusing significant resources on providing similar services to those that we provide that will compete with our services. We cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively compete with these other companies or that competitive pressures, including possible downward pressure on the prices we charge for our products and services, will not arise. In addition, the current declines in oil and natural gas prices may result in competitors moving resources from higher-cost exploration and production areas to relatively lower-cost exploration and production areas where we are located thereby increasing supply and putting further downward pressure on the prices we can charge for our products and services, including our rental business. In the event that we cannot effectively compete on a continuing basis, or competitive pressures arise, such inability to compete or competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAny interruption in our services due to pipeline ruptures or spills or necessary maintenance could impair our financial performance and negatively affect our brand.\nOur water transport pipelines are susceptible to ruptures and spills, particularly during start up and initial operation, and require ongoing inspection and maintenance. For example, in 2010 and 2011, we had breaks in our 50-mile underground pipeline network in the Haynesville Shale area that resulted in delays in transporting our customers\u2019 water and resulted in significant repair and remediation costs. We may experience further difficulties in maintaining the operation of our pipelines, which may cause downtime and delays. We also may be required to periodically shut down all or part of our pipelines for regulatory compliance and inspection purposes. Any interruption in our services due to pipeline breakdowns or necessary maintenance, inspection or regulatory compliance could reduce revenues and earnings and result in remediation costs. Transportation interruptions at our pipelines, even if only temporary, could severely harm our business and reputation, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, some of which are beyond our control. These risks may not be fully covered under our insurance policies.\nOur operations are subject to operational hazards, including accidents or equipment failures that can cause pollution and other damage to the environment. Pursuant to applicable law, we may be required to remediate the environmental impact of any such accidents or incidents, which may include costs related to site investigation and soil, groundwater and surface water cleanup. In addition, hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, such as, but not limited to, accidents, blowouts, explosions, pollution and other damage to the environment, fires and hydrocarbon spills, may delay or halt operations at extraction sites which we service. These conditions can cause:\n\u2022\npersonal injury or loss of life;\n\u2022\nliabilities from pipeline breaks and accidents by our fleet of trucks and other equipment;\n\u2022\ndamage to or destruction of property, equipment and the environment; and\n\u2022\nthe suspension of operations.\nThe occurrence of a significant event or a series of events that together are significant, or adverse claims in excess of the insurance coverage that we maintain or that are not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence at a location where our equipment and services are being used may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims.\nWe maintain insurance coverage that we believe to be customary in the industry against these hazards. We may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. In addition, insurance may not be available to cover any or all of the risks to which we are subject, or, even if available, the coverage provided by such insurance may be inadequate, or insurance premiums or other costs could make such insurance prohibitively expensive. It is likely that, in our insurance renewals, our premiums and deductibles will be higher, and certain insurance coverage either will be unavailable or considerably more expensive than it has been in the past. In addition, our insurance is subject to coverage limits, and some policies exclude coverage for damages resulting from environmental contamination.\nImprovements in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies or fracking methodologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, any improvement in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies (such as wind, solar, geothermal, fuel cells and biofuels) that increase the use of alternative forms of energy and reduce the demand for oil and natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, technological changes could decrease the quantities of water required for fracking operations or otherwise affect demand for our services.\nSeasonal weather conditions and natural disasters could severely disrupt normal operations and harm our business.\nAreas in which we operate are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions, primarily in the winter and spring. During periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, our customers may curtail their operations or we may be unable to move our trucks between locations or provide other services, thereby reducing demand for, or our ability to provide services and generate revenues. For example, many municipalities impose weight restrictions on the roads that lead to our customers\u2019 job sites in the spring due to the muddy conditions caused by spring thaws, limiting our access and our ability to provide service in these areas. In 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, inclement weather negatively impacted our operations in Pennsylvania and North Dakota. In September 2011 and October 2012, portions of Pennsylvania and other areas in the eastern United States had record rainfall and flooding. In February 2011, portions of Texas had record snowfalls. During those periods, we and our customers had to significantly reduce or halt operations, resulting in a loss of revenue. In addition, the regions in which we operate have in the past been, and may in the future be, affected by natural disasters such as hurricanes, windstorms, floods and tornadoes. In certain areas, our business may be dependent on our customers\u2019 ability to access sufficient water supplies to support their hydraulic fracturing operations. To the extent severe drought conditions or other factors prevent our customers from accessing adequate water supplies, our business could be negatively impacted. Future natural disasters or inclement weather conditions could severely disrupt the normal operation of our business, or our customers\u2019 business, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operating margins and profitability may be negatively impacted by changes in fuel and energy costs, in part due to the fixed cost structure of our business.\nOur business is dependent on availability of fuel for operating our fleet of trucks. Changes and volatility in the price of crude oil can adversely impact the prices for these products and therefore affect our operating results. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events beyond our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by OPEC and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries, regional production patterns, and environmental concerns.\nFurthermore, our facilities, fleet and personnel subject us to fixed costs, which make our margins and earnings sensitive to changes in revenues. In periods of declining demand, our fixed cost structure may limit our ability to cut costs, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage to firms with lower or more flexible cost structures, and may result in reduced operating margins and/or higher operating losses. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur financial and operating performance may be affected by the inability to renew landfill operating permits, obtain new landfills and expand existing ones.\nWe currently own one landfill and our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives may depend, in part, on our ability to acquire, lease, or renew landfill operating permits, expand existing landfills and develop new landfill sites. It has become increasingly difficult and expensive to obtain required permits and approvals to build, operate and expand solid waste management facilities, including landfills. Operating permits for landfills in states where we operate must generally be renewed every five to ten years, although some permits are required to be renewed more frequently. These operating permits often must be renewed several times during the permitted life of a landfill. The permit and approval process is often time consuming, requires numerous hearings and compliance with zoning, environmental and other requirements, is frequently challenged by special interest and other groups, and may result in the denial of a permit or renewal, the award of a permit or renewal for a shorter duration than we believed was otherwise required by law, or burdensome terms and conditions being imposed on our operations. We may not be able to obtain new landfill sites or expand the permitted capacity of our landfills when necessary. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards in the future may be subject to substantial limitations.\nWe believe that our ability to use our U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes in future years could be limited. Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383 provide annual limitations with respect to the ability of a corporation to utilize its net operating loss (as well as certain built-in losses) and tax credit carryforwards, respectively (\u201cTax Attributes\u201d), against future U.S. taxable income, if the corporation experiences an \u201cownership change.\u201d In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. A future transaction or transactions and the timing of such transaction or transactions could trigger an ownership change under Section 382. As a result of an ownership change, utilization of our Tax Attributes would be subject to an overall annual limitation determined in part by multiplying the total adjusted aggregate market value of our common stock immediately preceding the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate, possibly subject to increase based on the built-in gain, if any, in our assets at the time of the ownership change. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years. If an ownership change were to occur, future U.S. taxable income may not be fully offset by existing Tax Attributes in a given year if such income exceeds our annual limitation, resulting in higher cash taxes. Additionally, a Section 382 limitation could result in Tax Attributes expiring unused.\nWe are self-insured against many potential liabilities, and our reserves may not be sufficient to cover future claims.\nWe maintain high deductible or self-insured retention insurance policies for certain exposures including automobile, workers\u2019 compensation and employee group health insurance. We carry policies for certain types of claims to provide excess coverage beyond the underlying policies and per incident deductibles or self-insured retentions. Because many claims against us do not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies, we are effectively self-insured for a substantial portion of our claims. Our insurance accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. The insurance accruals are influenced by our past claims experience factors, which have a limited history, and by published industry development factors. The estimates inherent in these accruals are determined using actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry. If our insurance claims increase or if costs exceed our estimates of insurance liabilities, we could experience a decline in profitability and liquidity, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, should there be a loss or adverse judgment or other decision in an area for which we are self-insured, then our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected.\nWe evaluate our insurance accruals, and the underlying assumptions, regularly throughout the year and make adjustments as needed. While we believe that the recorded amounts are reasonable, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process. Changes in our assumptions and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or\nstolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, and damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business/operating margins, revenues and competitive position. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA failure in our operational systems, or those of third parties, may adversely affect our business.\nOur business is dependent upon our operational and technological systems to process a large amount of data. If any of our financial, operational, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our operational systems. In addition, dependence upon automated systems may further increase the risk that operational system flaws, employee tampering or manipulation of those systems could result in losses that are difficult to detect. We are heavily reliant on technology for communications, financial reporting, treasury management and many other important aspects of our business. Any failure in our operational systems could have a material adverse impact on our business. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer operational failures. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, including the ability to close our financial ledgers and report the results of our operations publicly on a timely basis or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $597.3 million of indebtedness, net of premiums and discounts of $0.6 million, outstanding on a consolidated basis, including our $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.875% Senior Notes due 2018 (the \"2018 Notes\"), $183.1 million under our asset-based revolving credit facility (the \u201cABL Facility\u201d) and $14.9 million of capital leases and notes payable for trucks and other vehicle financings. We had approximately $27.2 million of net availability under our credit facility as of March 13, 2015.\nOur primary source of capital is from borrowings available under our ABL Facility, as well as from cash generated by our operations with additional sources of capital in prior years from additional debt and equity accessed through the capital markets. Our historical acquisition activity was highly capital intensive and required significant investments in order to expand our presence in existing shale basins, access new markets and to expand the breadth and scope of services we provide. Additionally, we have historically issued equity as consideration in acquisition transactions. Our expected sources of capital in 2015 are expected to be from borrowings under our ABL Facility, cash generated by our operations and the net proceeds from the planned sale of TFI. Other sources of cash may include potential sales of assets, sale/leaseback transactions, additional debt or equity financing and reductions in our operating costs.\nGiven the current macro environment and oil and gas prices, we anticipate declining revenues in 2015, with corresponding reductions in costs from operations. In this environment, we expect sufficient availability under the ABL Facility to meet our operating needs. Our financing strategy includes using the proceeds from the planned sale of TFI, closely monitoring and lowering our operating costs and capital spending, and managing our working capital to enhance liquidity. Based on our current expectations and projections, we believe that our available cash, together with availability under the ABL Facility, will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital expenditures and interest payments under our debt obligations through at least the first quarter of 2016, which is our current, one-year forecast period.\nHowever, our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. Our substantial level of indebtedness could have other important consequences. For example, our level of indebtedness and the terms of our debt agreements may:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations under our other indebtedness and our contractual and commercial commitments and increase the risk that we may default on our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nprevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase the 2018 Notes tendered to us if there is a change of control, which would constitute a default under the indenture governing the 2018 Notes;\n\u2022\nheighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, our industry or in the general economy and restrict us from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions;\n\u2022\nlimit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds or cause lenders to be unwilling to lend additional amounts under existing or future lending credit facilities;\n\u2022\nconstrain our ability to fund increased working capital needs; and\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate or the general economy.\nEach of these factors may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and viability. Our ability to make payments with respect to the 2018 Notes and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors affecting us and our industry, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the indenture governing the 2018 Notes and the credit facility documentation contain restrictive covenants that will affect our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt.\nBorrowings under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates. If we were to borrow funds and these rates were to increase significantly, our ability to borrow additional funds may be reduced and the risks related to our substantial indebtedness could increase. While we may enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher interest rates, any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk. The effects of this risk could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service, lease payments and other obligations due to events beyond our control.\nOur interest expense related to the 2018 Notes, the borrowings under our credit facility, and our other indebtedness was approximately $50.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Our ability to generate cash flows from operations, to make scheduled payments on or refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our future financial performance and our ability to generate cash in the future. Our future financial performance will be affected by a range of economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors that we cannot control, such as general economic, legislative, regulatory and financial conditions in our industry, the economy generally or other risks described in our reports filed with the SEC. A significant reduction in operating cash flows resulting from changes in economic, legislative or regulatory conditions, increased competition or other events beyond our control could increase the need for additional or alternative sources of liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and our ability to service our debt and other obligations. If we are unable to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, seeking additional capital, or any combination of the foregoing. If we raise additional debt, it would increase our interest expense, leverage and our operating and financial costs. We cannot assure you that any of these alternative strategies could be affected on satisfactory terms, if at all, or that they would yield sufficient funds to make required payments on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. Reducing or delaying capital expenditures or selling assets could delay or diminish future cash flows. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nIf for any reason we are unable to meet our debt service and repayment obligations, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness, which would allow our creditors at that time to declare all outstanding indebtedness to be immediately due and payable. This would likely in turn trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default rights between our applicable debt agreements. Under these circumstances, our lenders could compel us to apply all of our available cash to repay our borrowings or they could prevent us from making payments on the 2018 Notes or our other indebtedness. In addition, the lenders under our credit facility or other secured indebtedness could seek to foreclose on our assets that collateralize the facility. If the amounts outstanding under our indebtedness were to be accelerated, or were the subject of foreclosure actions, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders or\nto our other debt holders. The effects of this risk could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDespite existing debt levels, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt, which would increase the risks associated with our leverage.\nEven with our existing debt levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial amounts of additional debt in the future, some or all of which may be secured. As of March 13, 2015 we had approximately $27.2 million of net availability under our credit facility. In addition, the indenture governing the 2018 Notes and the credit facility documentation allow us to issue additional debt, including additional notes, as well as capital leases and project finance obligations along with other forms of indebtedness, under certain circumstances. Although the terms of the credit facility and the indenture governing the 2018 Notes limit our ability to incur additional debt, these terms do not and will not prohibit us from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt for specific purposes or under certain circumstances, some or all of which may be secured. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face to satisfy our obligations could increase. The effects of this risk could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur credit facility and the indenture governing the 2018 Notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries that may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict our ability to operate our business.\nThe credit facility and the indenture governing the 2018 Notes contain covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to take various actions, such as:\n\u2022\ntransferring or selling assets;\n\u2022\npaying dividends or distributions, buying subordinated indebtedness or securities, making certain investments or making other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nincurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness or issuing preferred stock;\n\u2022\ncreating or incurring liens;\n\u2022\nincurring dividend or other payment restrictions affecting subsidiary guarantors;\n\u2022\nconsummating a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all our assets;\n\u2022\nentering into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nengaging in business other than a business that is the same or similar, reasonably related, complementary or incidental to our business;\n\u2022\nmaking acquisitions;\n\u2022\nmaking capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nentering into sale and leaseback transactions; and\n\u2022\nprepaying, redeeming or repurchasing debt prior to stated maturities.\nOur credit facility requires, and any future credit facilities will likely require, us to comply with specified financial ratios that may limit the amount we can borrow under our credit facility. A breach of any of the covenants under the indenture governing the 2018 Notes or the credit facility, as applicable, could result in a default. Our ability to satisfy those covenants depends principally upon our ability to meet or exceed certain positive operating performance metrics including, but not limited to, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, and ratios thereof, as well as certain balance sheet ratios. Any debt agreements we enter into in the future may further limit our ability to enter into certain types of transactions.\nThe ABL Facility contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a senior leverage ratio and, upon the occurrence of certain specified conditions, a fixed charge coverage ratio as well as certain customary limitations on our ability to, among other things, incur debt, grant liens, make acquisitions and other investments, make certain restricted payments such as dividends, dispose of assets or undergo a change in control. The senior leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of senior secured debt to adjusted EBITDA (which includes net (loss) income loss plus certain items such as interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, stock-based compensation and other adjustments as defined in the indenture), and is limited to 3.0 to 1.0. Our $400.0 million of 2018 Notes are not secured and thus are excluded from the calculation of this ratio. The\nfixed charge coverage ratio, which only applies if excess availability under the ABL Facility falls below 12.5% of the maximum revolver amount, requires the ratio of adjusted EBITDA (as defined) less capital expenditures to fixed charges (as defined) to be at least 1.1 to 1.0. The senior leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants could have the effect of limiting our availability under the ABL Facility, as additional borrowings would be prohibited if, after giving pro forma effect thereto, we would be in violation of either such covenant. As of December 31, 2014, we remained in compliance with our debt covenants and the availability was $56.5 million; however, our ratio of adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges was less than 1.1 to 1.0 (as calculated pursuant to the ABL Facility). As such, our net availability was reduced by 12.5% of the maximum revolver amount, or $30.6 million, resulting in approximately $25.9 million of net availability as of December 31, 2014.\nThe maximum amount we can borrow under our ABL Facility is subject to contractual and borrowing base limitations which could significantly and negatively impact our future access to capital required to operate our business. Borrowing base limitations are based upon eligible accounts receivable and equipment. If the value of our accounts receivable or equipment decreases for any reason, or if some portion of our accounts receivable or equipment is deemed ineligible under the terms of our credit facility agreement, the amount we can borrow under the credit facility could be reduced. These limitations could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition. In addition, the administrative agent for our ABL Facility has the periodic right to perform an appraisal of the assets comprising our borrowing base. If an appraisal results in a reduction of the borrowing base, then a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility could become immediately due and payable. Any such repayment obligation could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition.\nThe indenture governing the 2018 Notes contains restrictive covenants on the incurrence of senior secured indebtedness, including incurring new borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which would limit our ability to incur incremental new senior secured indebtedness in certain circumstances and access to capital if our fixed charge coverage ratio falls below 2.0 to 1.0. To the extent that the fixed charge coverage ratio is below 2.0 to 1.0, the indenture prohibits our incurrence of new senior secured indebtedness, at that point in time, to the greater of $150.0 million and the amount of debt as restricted by the secured leverage ratio, which is the ratio of senior secured debt to EBITDA, of 2.0 to 1.0, as determined pursuant to the indenture. The covenant does not require repayment of existing borrowings if greater than $150 million at that time, but rather limits new borrowings during any such period. The 2.0 to 1.0 fixed charge coverage ratio is an incurrence covenant, not a maintenance covenant.\nThe covenants described above are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. Our ability to comply with these covenants will likely be affected by some events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy those requirements. A breach of any of these provisions could result in a default under such indenture, credit facility or other debt obligation, or any future credit facilities we may enter into, which could allow all amounts outstanding thereunder to be declared immediately due and payable, subject to the terms and conditions of the documents governing such indebtedness. If we were unable to repay the accelerated amounts, our secured lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. This would likely in turn trigger cross-acceleration and cross-default rights under any other credit facilities and indentures. If the amounts outstanding under the 2018 Notes or any other indebtedness outstanding at such time were to be accelerated or were the subject of foreclosure actions, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders or to our other debt holders. We were in compliance with such covenants as of December 31, 2014 and March 13, 2015.\nWe may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by such restrictive covenants. These restrictions may also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions, execute our business strategy, effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted or engage in other business activities that would be in our interest. In the future, we may also incur debt obligations that might subject us to additional and different restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to the indenture governing the 2018 Notes, the credit facility or such other debt obligations if for any reason we are unable to comply with our obligations thereunder or that we will be able to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, or at all, should we seek to do so. Any such limitations on borrowing under our credit facility could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.\nOur borrowings under our credit facility expose us to interest rate risk.\nOur earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our credit facility. Our credit facility carries a floating interest rate; therefore, as interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to make acquisitions may be adversely impacted by our outstanding indebtedness and by the price of our stock.\nOur ability to make future business acquisitions, particularly those that would be financed solely or in part through cash from operations, will be curtailed due to our obligations to make payments of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness. We may not have sufficient capital resources, now or in the future, and may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital resources on terms satisfactory to us, if at all, in order to meet our capital requirements for such acquisitions. In addition, the terms of our indebtedness include covenants that directly restrict, or have the effect of restricting, our ability to make certain acquisitions while this indebtedness remains outstanding. To the extent that the amount of our outstanding indebtedness has a negative impact on our stock price, using our common stock as consideration will be less attractive for potential acquisition candidates. The future trading price of our common stock could limit our willingness to use our equity as consideration and the willingness of sellers to accept our shares and as a result could limit the size and scope of our acquisition program. If we are unable to pursue strategic acquisitions that would enhance our business or operations, the potential growth of our business and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could have a material adverse effect.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe may issue a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the future and stockholders may be adversely affected by the issuance of those shares.\nWe may raise additional capital by issuing shares of common stock, which will increase the number of common shares outstanding and may result in dilution in the equity interest of our current stockholders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We have filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC which allows us to issue up to $400.0 million in debt, equity and hybrid securities. As of December 31, 2014, we had issued 1.8 million shares of common stock at a total price of $80.1 million, under this registration statement and could issue up to an additional $319.9 million of debt, equity or hybrid securities. In addition, we have issued shares of our common stock pursuant to private placement exemptions from Securities Act registration requirements, and may do so in connection with financings, acquisitions, the settlement of litigation and other strategic transactions in the future. The issuance, and the resale or potential resale, of shares of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could be dilutive to our stockholders.\nOur stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities.\nThe stock markets have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly operating results and changes in our liquidity position;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance;\n\u2022\ninaccurate or negative comments about us on social networking websites or other media channels;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new products or product enhancements, as well as our or our competitors' success or failure in successfully executing such matters;\n\u2022\nchanges in the price of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nloss of a major customer or failure to complete significant transactions; and\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel.\nThe trading price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, or \u201cNYSE,\u201d since our initial public offering has ranged from a high of $107.40 on September 3, 2008 to a low of $4.80 on December 24, 2014. The last reported price of our common stock on the NYSE on March 13, 2015 was $2.92 per share.\nIf our common stock fails to meet all applicable listing requirements, it could be delisted from the NYSE, which could adversely affect the market price and liquidity of our common stock and harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the NYSE. If we fail to meet any of the continued listing standards of the NYSE, our common stock could be delisted from the NYSE. These continued listing standards include, among others, maintaining a $1.00 minimum average closing stock price per share. Our common stock has traded as low as $1.65 per share during the prior 52-week period. If the average price of our common stock is less than $1.00 per share for thirty consecutive trading days, there can be no assurance that the NYSE will not take action to enforce its continued listing standards. Any delisting of our common stock from the NYSE could adversely affect the market price and liquidity of our common stock, impair our ability to raise capital necessary to maintain operations and service our debt, cause significant loss of investor interest in our securities, cause a loss of confidence among our employees and customers and otherwise negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe currently do not intend to pay any dividends on our common stock.\nWe currently do not intend to pay any dividends on our common stock, and restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements may prohibit us from paying dividends now or in the future. While we may declare dividends at some point in the future, subject to compliance with such restrictions and covenants, we cannot assure you that you will ever receive cash dividends as a result of ownership of our common stock and any gains from investment in our common stock may only come from increases in the market price of our common stock, if any.\nWe are subject to anti-takeover effects of certain charter and bylaw provisions and Delaware law, as well as of our substantial insider ownership.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each as amended and restated, and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management and board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders;\n\u2022\nestablishing a classified board of directors, so that only approximately one-third of our directors are elected each year;\n\u2022\nproviding our board of directors the ability to set the number of directors and to fill vacancies on the board of directors occurring between stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nproviding that directors may only be removed only for \u201ccause\u201d and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority in voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock; and\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings.\nWe are also subject to provisions of the Delaware corporation law that, in general, prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15% or more of our common stock for three years following the date the beneficial owner acquired at least 15% of our stock, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors. Together, these charter and statutory provisions could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures, as well as the significant amount of common stock beneficially owned by our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mr. Johnsrud, could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nRisks Related to Environmental and Other Governmental Regulation\nWe are subject to United States federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to health, safety, transportation, and protection of natural resources and the environment. Under these laws and regulations, we may become liable for significant penalties, damages or costs of remediation. Any changes in laws and regulations could increase our costs of doing business.\nOur operations, and those of our customers, are subject to United States federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to health, safety, transportation and protection of natural resources and the environment and worker safety, including those relating\nto waste management and transportation and disposal of produced water and other materials. For example, we are subject to environmental regulation relating to disposal into injection wells, which can pose some risks of environmental liability, including leakage from the wells to surface or subsurface soils, surface water or groundwater. Liability under these laws and regulations could result in cancellation of well operations, fines and penalties, expenditures for remediation, and liability for property damage and personal injuries. In addition, federal, state and local laws and regulations may be passed which would have the effect of increasing costs to our customers and possibly decreasing demand for our services. For example, if new laws and regulations are passed requiring increased safety measures for rail transport of crude oil, such laws and regulations may make it more difficult and expensive for customers to transport their product, which could decrease our customers\u2019 demand for our services and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. Similarly, many of our customers have intrastate pipeline operations that are subject to regulation by various agencies of the states in which they are located. If new laws and/or regulations that further regulate intrastate pipelines are adopted in response to equipment failures, spills, negative environmental effects, or public sentiment, our customers may face increased costs of compliance, and thus reduce demand for our services\nOur business involves the use, handling, storage, and contracting for recycling or disposal of environmentally sensitive materials. Accordingly, we are subject to regulation by federal, state, and local authorities establishing investigation and health and environmental quality standards, and liability related thereto, and providing penalties for violations of those standards. We also are subject to laws, ordinances, and regulations governing investigation and remediation of contamination at facilities we operate or to which we send hazardous or toxic substances or wastes for treatment, recycling, or disposal. In particular, CERCLA imposes joint, strict, and several liability on owners or operators of facilities at, from, or to which a release of hazardous substances has occurred; parties that generated hazardous substances that were released at such facilities; and parties that transported or arranged for the transportation of hazardous substances to such facilities. A majority of states have adopted statutes comparable to and, in some cases, more stringent than CERCLA. If we were to be found to be a responsible party under CERCLA or a similar state statute, we could be held liable for all investigative and remedial costs associated with addressing such contamination. In addition, claims alleging personal injury or property damage may be brought against us as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances resulting from our operations.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of significant administrative, civil or criminal penalties, imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, revocation of permits, and orders to limit or cease certain operations. In addition, certain environmental laws impose strict and/or joint and several liability, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time of those actions. For example, if a landfill or disposal operator mismanages our wastes in a way that creates an environmental hazard, we and all others who sent materials could become liable for cleanup costs, fines and other expenses many years after the disposal or recycling was completed. Future events, such as the discovery of currently unknown matters, spills caused by future pipeline ruptures, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation, and more vigorous enforcement policies by regulatory agencies, may give rise to additional expenditures or liabilities, which could impair our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, legal requirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation. New laws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertainty regarding adequate testing and sampling procedures, new pollution control technology and cost benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increase our future capital expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Accordingly, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations.\nIncreased regulation of hydraulic fracturing, including regulation of the quantities, sources and methods of water use and disposal, could result in reduction in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells or minimize water use or disposal, which could adversely impact the demand for our services.\nDemand for our services depends, in large part, on the level of exploration and production of oil and gas and the oil and gas industry\u2019s willingness to purchase our services. Most of our customer base uses hydraulic fracturing to drill new oil and gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing is a process that is used to release hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from certain geological formations. The process involves the injection of water (typically mixed with significant quantities of sand and small quantities of chemical additives) under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate movement of hydrocarbons through the formation. The process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions and has been exempt (except when the fracturing fluids or propping agents contain diesel fuels) since 2005 from United States federal regulation pursuant to the SDWA.\nThe EPA is conducting a comprehensive study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities, and a committee of the United States House of Representatives is also conducting an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices.\nThe results of the EPA study and House investigation could lead to restrictions on hydraulic fracturing. On February 11, 2014, the EPA released revised underground injection control (UIC) program permitting guidance for wells that use diesel fuels during hydraulic fracturing activities. EPA developed the guidance to clarify how companies can comply with a law passed by Congress in 2005, which exempted hydraulic fracturing operations from the requirement to obtain a UIC permit, except in cases where diesel fuel is used as a fracturing fluid. In a February 5, 2014 memorandum, EPA\u2019s Inspector General (IG) announced plans to evaluate how EPA and the states have used their regulatory authority to address potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on water resources. The IG reportedly will \u201cevaluate what regulatory authority is available to the EPA and states, identify potential threats to water resources from hydraulic fracturing, and evaluate the EPA\u2019s and states\u2019 responses to them.\u201d In addition, the EPA finalized regulations under the CAA in October 2012 regarding certain criteria and hazardous air pollutant emissions from hydraulic fracturing wells and, in October 2011, announced its intention to propose regulations by 2014 under the CWA to regulate wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and other gas production. The EPA has also announced that it will propose rules on effluent limitations for the treatment of discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing in early 2015. Legislation has been introduced before Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, including, for example, requiring disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process or seeking to repeal the exemption from the SWDA. If adopted, such legislation would add an additional level of regulation and necessary permitting at the federal level and could make it more difficult to complete wells using hydraulic fracturing. Similar laws and regulations with respect to chemical disclosure also exist or are being considered by the United States Department of Interior and in several states, including certain states in which we operate, that could restrict hydraulic fracturing. The Delaware River Basin Commission is also considering regulations which may impact \u201chydrofracturing\u201d water practices in certain areas of Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Delaware. Some local governments have also sought to restrict drilling in certain areas.\nAdditionally, in response to concerns about seismic activity being triggered by the injection of produced waters into underground wells, certain regulators have adopted or are considering additional requirements related to seismic safety for hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, in January 2012, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources issued a temporary moratorium on the development of hydraulic fracturing disposal wells in northeast Ohio due to minor earthquakes reported in the area. In Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission (the \"RRC\") amended its existing oil and gas disposal well regulations to require applicants for new disposal wells to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey to assess whether the RRC should impose limits on existing wells, including a temporary injection ban. Finally, the state of Arkansas imposed a moratorium on waste water injection in certain areas due to concerns that hydraulic fracturing may be related to increased earthquake activity. Such laws and regulations could delay or curtail production of oil and natural gas by our customers, and thus reduce demand for our services.\nFuture United States federal, state or local laws or regulations could significantly restrict, or increase costs associated with hydraulic fracturing and make it more difficult or costly for producers to conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, which could result in a decline in exploration and production. New laws and regulations, and new enforcement policies by regulatory agencies, could also expressly restrict the quantities, sources and methods of water use and disposal in hydraulic fracturing and otherwise increase our costs and our customers\u2019 cost of compliance, which could minimize water use and disposal needs even if other limits on drilling and completing new wells were not imposed. Any decline in exploration and production or any restrictions on water use and disposal could result in a decline in demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDelays or restrictions in obtaining permits by our customers for their operations or by us for our operations could impair our business.\nIn most states, our customers are required to obtain permits from one or more governmental agencies in order to perform drilling and completion activities and we may be required to procure permits for construction and operation of our disposal wells and pipelines. Such permits are typically required by state agencies, but can also be required by federal and local governmental agencies. The requirements for such permits vary depending on the location where our, or our customers\u2019, activities will be conducted. As with all governmental permitting processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit to be issued, and the conditions which may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. Delays or restrictions in obtaining saltwater disposal well permits could adversely impact our growth, which is dependent in part on new disposal capacity.\nOur customers have been affected by moratoriums that have been imposed on the issuance of permits for drilling and completion activities in certain jurisdictions. For example, in December 2010, the State of New York imposed a moratorium on certain drilling and completion activities. In 2011, the state announced plans to lift the moratorium, however, in December 2014 the state announced that it intended to take action to prohibit certain drilling and completion activities, including hydraulic fracturing, in the state. A similar moratorium has been in place within the Delaware River Basin pending issuance of regulations by the Delaware River Basin Commission. Other states, including Texas, Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Wyoming and Colorado, have enacted laws and regulations applicable to our business activities, including disclosure of information regarding\nthe substances used in hydraulic fracturing. California is presently considering similar requirements. The EPA published a rule on January 9, 2014 requiring oil and gas companies using hydraulic fracturing off the coast of California to disclose the chemicals they discharge into the ocean. Some of the drilling and completion activities of our customers may take place on federal land, requiring leases from the federal government to conduct such drilling and completion activities. In some cases, federal agencies have canceled oil and natural gas leases on federal lands. Consequently, our operations in certain areas of the country may be interrupted or suspended for varying lengths of time, causing a loss of revenue and potentially having a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to the trucking safety regulations, which are likely to be amended, and made stricter, as part of the initiative known as Compliance, Safety, Accountability, or \u201cCSA.\u201d If our current USDOT safety rating of \u201cSatisfactory\u201d is downgraded in connection with this initiative, our business and results of our operations may be adversely affected.\nAs part of the CSA initiative, the FMCSA is continuously revising its safety rating methodology and implementation of the same. These revisions will likely link safety ratings more closely to roadside inspection and driver violation data gathered and analyzed from month to month under the FMCSA\u2019s new Safety Measurement System, or \u201cSMS\u201d and may place increased scrutiny on carriers transporting significant quantities of hazardous material. This linkage could result in greater variability in safety ratings than the current system. Preliminary studies by transportation consulting firms indicate that \u201cSatisfactory\u201d ratings (or any equivalent under a new SMS-based system) may become more difficult to achieve and maintain under such a system. If our operations lose their current \u201cSatisfactory\u201d rating, which is the highest and best rating under this initiative, we may lose some of our customer contracts that require such a rating, adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 92395, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "NES"}
