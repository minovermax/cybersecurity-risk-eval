RISK FACTORS\nInvestment in our securities involves risks and uncertainties, some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to our business. The discussion below addresses the material risks and uncertainties, of which we are currently aware, that could adversely affect our business and impact results of operations or financial condition. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks factors actually occurs, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be harmed as a result.\nRisks Relating to the Economy, Financial Markets, and Interest Rates\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions have adversely impacted our business and results and could have a more material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the United States and international economies and financial markets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions to our business and could cause material disruptions to our business and operations in the future. Impacts to our business have included decreases in customer traffic in our retail branch locations, the transition of a significant portion of our workforce to remote locations, increases in requests for forbearance and loan modifications, and additional health and safety precautions implemented at all physical locations. To the extent that commercial and social restrictions remain in place or increase, our delinquencies, foreclosures, and credit losses may materially increase and we could experience reductions in fee income as transaction volumes decline.\nUnfavorable economic conditions may also make it more difficult for us to maintain loan origination volume. Furthermore, such conditions have and may continue to cause the value of collateral associated with our existing loans to decline. The persistence or worsening of current economic conditions could also adversely affect certain risks related to our accounting estimates.\nWhile we have taken and are continuing to take actions to protect the safety and well-being of our employees, customers, and communities, no assurance can be given that the steps being taken will be adequate.\nAmong the factors outside our control that are likely to affect the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will ultimately have on our business are:\n\u2022the pandemic\u2019s course and severity;\n\u2022direct and indirect results of the pandemic, such as recessionary economic trends, including with respect to employment, wages and benefits, commercial activity, consumer spending and real estate market values;\n\u2022political, legal and regulatory actions and policies in response to the pandemic, including any effect of restrictions on commerce and banking, such as dividends, moratorium or other suspension of collection, foreclosure, or related obligation;\n\u2022timing, magnitude and effects of public spending, directly or through subsidies, its direct and indirect effects on commercial activity and incentives of employers and individuals to resume or increase employment, wages and benefits and commercial activity;\n\u2022timing and availability of direct and indirect governmental support for various financial assets, including mortgage loans;\n\u2022potential impact of changes in medical spending and unemployment on our health savings account (HSA) business and related deposits;\n\u2022long-term effects of the economic downturn on the value of our assets and related accounting estimates;\n\u2022potential longer-term effects of increased government spending on the interest rate environment and borrowing costs for non-governmental parties;\n\u2022potential longer-term shifts toward mobile banking, telecommuting and telecommerce; and\n\u2022geographic variation in the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including in states in which we operate physically such as Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Wisconsin.\nWe continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine availability and deployment, and related risks, although the rapid development and fluidity of these situations preclude any specific prediction as to its ultimate impact on us. If the pandemic continues to spread or otherwise result in a continuation or worsening of the current economic and commercial environments, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nDifficult conditions in the economy and the financial markets may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur financial performance is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate and in the United States as a whole. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, decreases in business activity, weakening of investor or business confidence, limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital, increases in inflation, changes in interest rates, changes in laws, high unemployment, national and international political turmoil, the imposition of tariffs on trade, natural disasters or a combination of these or other factors.\nRecently, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in commercial activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions, increased unemployment, and overall economic and financial market instability.\nIn addition to the risk associated with the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may face the following risks in connection with developments in the current economic and market environment:\n\u2022consumer and business confidence levels may decline and lead to less credit usage and increases in delinquencies and default rates;\n\u2022our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future behaviors;\n\u2022customer desire to do business with us may decline, whether as a result of a decreased demand for loans or other financial products and services or decreased deposits or other investments in accounts with us;\n\u2022competition in our industry could intensify as a result of the continued consolidation of financial services companies and changes in financial services technologies; and\n\u2022the effects of recent and proposed changes in laws.\nThe business environment and financial markets in the U.S. have experienced volatility in recent years and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that economic conditions will not worsen. Difficult economic conditions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in local economic conditions could adversely affect our business.\nA significant percentage of our loans are secured by real estate, primarily across the Northeast. Our success depends in part upon economic conditions in Southern New England and our other geographic markets. These areas have been and continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including Connecticut, where we are headquartered, and New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin, in which we have significant operations. Continued difficult economic conditions or further adverse changes in such local markets could reduce our growth in loans and deposits, increase problem loans and charge-offs, and otherwise negatively affect our performance and financial condition.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated if the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates and spreads may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur consolidated earnings and financial condition are dependent to a large degree upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned from loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The narrowing of interest rate spreads could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. We cannot predict with certainty or control changes in interest rates. Regional and local economic conditions and the policies of regulatory authorities, including monetary policies of the FRB, affect interest income and interest expense. While we have ongoing policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates, changes in interest rates still may have an adverse effect on our profitability. For example, high interest rates could affect the amount of loans that we can originate because higher rates could cause customers to apply for fewer mortgages, cause depositors to shift funds from accounts that have a comparatively lower cost to accounts with a higher cost, or cause us to experience customer attrition due to competitor pricing. If the cost of interest-bearing deposits increases at a rate greater than the yields on interest-earning assets increase, net interest income will be negatively affected. Changes in the asset and liability mix may also affect net interest income. Similarly, lower interest rates cause higher yielding assets to prepay and floating or adjustable rate assets to reset to lower rates. If we were not able to reduce our funding costs sufficiently, due to either competitive factors or the maturity schedule of existing liabilities, then our net interest margin would decline.\nIn March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to a range from 0 to 0.25 percent in part as a result of the pandemic. A prolonged period of very low interest rates could have a material adverse impact on our interest income and the market value of our investments. Refer to Asset/Liability Management and Market Risk section in the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis within this document for more information regarding the impact of the interest rate environment.\nThe uncertainty about the future of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) may adversely impact our business.\nThe United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, the authority that regulates LIBOR, has announced it intends to stop compelling contributing banks to submit to the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) Benchmark Administrator the rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021, which may result in the use of LIBOR in financial contracts being phased out by the end of 2021. Certain US Dollar LIBOR rates will continue to be published until June 30, 2023 for existing LIBOR-indexed financial instruments, however no new LIBOR-indexed financial instruments can be originated after December 31, 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York represents best alternative to LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR, and the Company is currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. It is not possible at this time to predict what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments. The market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, such as SOFR, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our loan and lease and investment portfolios, asset-liability management, business, financial condition, and results of operations. Webster has interest rate swap agreements and other instruments that are indexed to LIBOR and is currently monitoring and evaluating this activity and the related risks. The transition may change our market risk profile, potentially requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our business and reputation and increase legal and operational costs.\nRegulatory, Compliance, Legal, and Environmental Risks\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision, which may interfere with our ability to conduct our business and may negatively impact our financial results.\nWe, primarily through Webster Bank and certain non-bank subsidiaries, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, the DIF, and the safety and soundness of the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, and/or limit what we may charge for certain banking services, among other things. Additionally, recent changes to the legal and regulatory framework governing our operation, including the continued implementation of Dodd-Frank and EGRRCPA, have and will continue to affect the lending, investment, trading, and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. Dodd-Frank imposed additional regulatory obligations and increased scrutiny from federal banking agencies. In general, we expect this focus to continue and compliance requirements can be costly to implement. Compliance personnel and resources may increase our costs of operations and adversely impact our earnings.\nFailure to comply with laws, regulations, or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWhile we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. See the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in Item 1 of this report for further information.\nChanges in accounting standards and policies could materially impact how we report our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our results of operations and financial condition. Accordingly, we exercise judgment in selecting and applying these accounting policies and methods so they comply with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), regulatory agencies, and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. Additionally, those bodies may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. The impact of these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we report our results of operations and financial condition. We could be required to apply new or revised guidance retrospectively, which may result in the revision of prior period financial statements by material amounts. Such changes could also require the Company to incur additional personnel, technology, or other costs. For example, under CECL, the new accounting standard on credit losses which became effective for us on January 1, 2020, credit losses on loans and held-to-maturity securities and other financial assets carried at amortized cost are required to be recognized earlier than in the past. A discussion of accounting standards recently adopted, including CECL, and issued but not yet adopted can be found in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nHealth care reforms could adversely affect our HSA Bank division, revenues, financial position, and results of operations.\nThe enactment of health care reforms affecting health savings accounts at the federal or state level may affect our HSA Bank division, which is a bank custodian of health savings accounts. We cannot predict if any such reforms will ultimately become law, or, if enacted, what their terms or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws will be. Any health care reforms enacted may be phased in over a number of years but, if enacted, could, with respect to the operations of HSA Bank, reduce revenues, increase costs, and require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business. In addition, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such changes.\nThe Holding Company may not pay dividends if we are not able to receive dividends from our subsidiary, Webster Bank.\nThe Holding Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and non-banking subsidiaries and depend on the payment of cash dividends from Webster Bank and our existing liquid assets as the principal sources of funds for paying cash dividends on our common stock. Unless we receive dividends from Webster Bank or choose to use our liquid assets, we may not be able to pay dividends. Webster Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends is subject to its ability to earn net income and to meet certain regulatory requirements. See the sub-section captioned \u201cDividends\u201d in Item 1 of this report for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we obtain title.\nA large portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate. In the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a government entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation, and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation and remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. These costs and claims could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nRisks Relating to Business Environment and Operations\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and market area. If we fail to compete effectively, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources than we do. Such competitors primarily include national, regional, and community banks within the various markets in which we operate. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loans, credit unions, non-bank health savings account trustees, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, online lenders, factoring companies, and other financial intermediaries. Some of the financial services organizations with which the Company competes are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured depository institutions, which may give them certain advantages over the Company in accessing funding and in providing various services. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory, and technological changes and continued consolidation. Technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services than we do, as well as better pricing for those products and services.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards, and safe, sound assets;\n\u2022our ability to successfully achieve the anticipated cost reductions and retain customer relationships from strategic initiatives and any higher than anticipated costs or delays in implementing the banking center consolidation plan;\n\u2022the ability to expand market position;\n\u2022the scope, relevance, and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n\u2022customer satisfaction with our level of service and products; and\n\u2022industry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of key partnerships could adversely affect our HSA Bank division.\nOur HSA Bank division relies on partnerships with various health insurance carriers and other partners to maximize our distribution model. In particular, health plan partners who provide high deductible health plan options are a significant source of new and existing health savings account holders. If these health plan partners or other partners choose to align with our competitors or develop their own solutions, our results of operations, business, and prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe continually encounter technological change. The failure to adapt to these changes could negatively impact our business.\nFinancial services industries continually experience rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. An effective use of technology can increase efficiency, enable financial institutions to better serve customers, and reduce costs. However, some new technologies needed to compete effectively result in incremental operating costs and capital investments. Our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations. Many of our competitors, because of their larger size and available capital, have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers within the same time frame as our large competitors. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure or breach of our systems, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and cause losses.\nAs a financial institution, we depend on our ability to process, record, and monitor a large number of customer transactions, and customer, public, and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased over time. Accordingly, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions, and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, data processing systems, or other operating systems and facilities, including mobile banking and other recently developed technologies, may stop operating properly or become disabled or compromised as a result of a number of factors that may be wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters; pandemics; events arising from political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and cyber-attacks. Although we have business continuity plans and believe we have robust information security procedures and controls in place, disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the\nnetworks, systems, or devices on which customers\u2019 personal information is stored and that our customers use to access our products and services, could result in customer attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThird parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries, or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including breakdowns or failures of their own systems, capacity constraints, and cyber-attacks.\nIn recent years, information security risks for financial institutions have increased due in part to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, hostile foreign governments, activists, and other external parties. There have been several instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting unauthorized access to, and disclosure of, client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data. There have also been highly publicized cases where hackers have requested ransom-payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related increase in remote working by our personnel and the personnel of other companies, the risk of cyber-attacks, breaches or similar events, whether through our systems or those of third parties on which we rely, has increased.\nAlthough to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened, and as a result, the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes, and practices designed to protect and facilitate the recovery of our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access remain a high priority for us. As an additional layer of protection, we have purchased network and privacy liability risk insurance coverage which includes digital asset loss, business interruption loss, network security liability, privacy liability, network extortion, and data breach coverage, though there can be no assurance that such insurance will fully cover any actual losses. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nDisruptions in services provided by third-party vendors may result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations. For example, we are dependent on our vendor-provided core banking processing systems to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions. Accordingly, we are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements or service level agreements because of changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure, financial condition, changes in support for existing products, services, and technology, changes in strategic focus, effects related to the COVID-19 pandemic, or for any other reason. Such failure to perform could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. While we require third-party outsourced service providers to have business continuity and disaster recovery plans that are aligned with our overall recovery plans, we cannot be assured that such plans will operate successfully or in a timely manner so as to prevent any such material adverse impact.\nWe face risks in connection with completed or potential acquisitions.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate expansion through the acquisition of banks or branches, or other financial businesses or assets. Such acquisitions involve various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022the possible loss of key employees and customers;\n\u2022potential business disruptions;\n\u2022potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the business;\n\u2022potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities; and\n\u2022potential difficulties in integrating the target business into our own.\nAcquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and therefore, some dilution of the Company\u2019s tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by fraud.\nAs a financial institution, we are inherently exposed to operational risk in the form of theft and other fraudulent activity by employees, customers, and other third parties targeting the Company or the Company\u2019s customers or data. Such activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Although we devote substantial resources to maintaining effective policies and internal controls to identify and prevent such incidents, given the increasing sophistication of possible perpetrators, we may experience financial losses or reputational harm as a result of fraud.\nRisks Relating to Accounting Estimates\nOur allowance for credit losses may be insufficient.\nOur business is subject to periodic fluctuations based on national and local economic conditions. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition. For example, declines in housing activity including declines in building permits, and home prices, may make it more difficult for our borrowers to sell their homes or refinance their debt. Sales may also slow, which could strain the resources of real estate developers and builders. We may suffer higher credit losses as a result of these factors and the resulting impact on our borrowers. A declining economy could negatively affect employment levels and impact the ability of our borrowers to service their debt. Bank regulatory agencies also periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for credit losses, we may need, depending on an analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, additional provisions to increase the allowance for credit losses. Any increases in the allowance for credit losses will result in a decrease in net income, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and regulatory position.\nWe may not be able to fully realize the balance of our net DTA.\nThe value of our DTA is partially reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of our DTA will not be realized. We regularly assess available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that our net DTA will not be realized. Realization of a DTA requires us to apply significant judgment and is inherently speculative because it requires estimates that cannot be made with certainty. If we were to conclude that a significant portion of our remaining DTA is not more-likely-than-not to be realized, the required valuation allowance could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and regulatory capital ratios.\nIf our goodwill were determined to be impaired it could have a negative impact on our profitability.\nWebster evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if necessary. A significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a continuing period of market disruption, market capitalization to book value deterioration, or slower growth rates may require us to record charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill. If we were to conclude that a future write-down is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, failure to implement any necessary improvement of our controls and procedures, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur stock price can be volatile.\nStock price volatility may negatively impact the price at which our common stock may be sold, and may also negatively impact the timing of any sale. Our stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, among other things:\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in operating results;\n\u2022changes in recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022news reports relating to trends, concerns, and other issues in the financial services and healthcare industries;\n\u2022new technology used or services offered by competitors;\n\u2022perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n\u2022significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n\u2022additional investments from third parties;\n\u2022issuance of additional shares of stock;\n\u2022changes in government regulations or actions by government regulators; and\n\u2022geo-political conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors, and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes, credit loss trends, or currency fluctuations, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of our operating results.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in severe volatility in the financial markets, including our common stock, and meaningfully lower stock prices for many companies.\nChanges in the federal, state or local tax laws may negatively impact our financial performance.\nWe are subject to changes in tax law that could increase our effective tax rates. Such changes in tax laws, interpretation, guidance, or regulation that may be promulgated could negatively impact our business and our customers. The new administration has indicated it may propose an increase in the federal corporate tax rate. We are unable to predict whether this, or any other proposed change will ultimately be enacted.\nWe are subject to financial and reputational risks from potential liability arising from lawsuits.\nThe nature of our business ordinarily results in a certain amount of claims and legal action. Whether claims and related legal actions are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect how the market perceives us, the products and services we offer, as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. We assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings as well as certain threatened claims utilizing the latest and most reliable information. For matters where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be estimated, no accrual is established. For matters where it is probable we will incur a loss and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we establish an accrual for the loss. Once established, the accrual is adjusted periodically to reflect any relevant developments. The actual cost of any outstanding legal proceedings or threatened claims, however, may turn out to be substantially higher than the amount accrued. These costs may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or retain them. The availability of key personnel can also be affected by external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic or similar events. The unexpected loss of services of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on the business as we would lose their skills, knowledge of the market, and years of industry experience, and may have difficulty promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks. A failure to successfully manage these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business, offer new products and services within existing lines of business, or shift our asset mix. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, and/or shifting asset mix, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove attainable. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 10932, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "WBS"}
