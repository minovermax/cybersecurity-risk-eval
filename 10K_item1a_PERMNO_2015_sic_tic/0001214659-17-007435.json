{"cik": "825324", "company": "Good Times Restaurants Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-12-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully the following risk factors before making an investment decision with respect to our securities. You are cautioned that the risk factors discussed below are not exhaustive.\nRisk Related to the Company\nWe have accumulated losses and expect losses in the future.\nWe have incurred losses in 26 of our 30 years since inception. As of September 26, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $24,380,000. We expect to have a loss for the fiscal year ending September 25, 2018.\nIf we are unable to continue to increase same store sales at existing restaurants, our ability to attain profitability may be adversely affected.\nWe have increased same-store sales for the past seven consecutive years at Good Times. Additional same-store sales increases will depend in part on the success of our advertising and promotion of new and existing menu items and consumer acceptance. We cannot assure that our advertising and promotional efforts will in fact be successful. If our same-store sales decrease, and our other operating costs increase, our ability to attain profitability will be adversely affected.\nNew restaurants, when and if opened, may not be profitable, if at all, for several months.\nWe anticipate that our new restaurants, when and if opened, will generally take several months to reach normalized operating levels due to inefficiencies typically associated with new restaurants, including lack of market awareness, the need to hire and train a sufficient number of employees, operating costs which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation than thereafter, preopening costs and other factors. In addition, restaurants opened in new markets may open at lower average weekly sales volumes than restaurants opened in existing markets, and may have higher restaurant level operating expense ratios than in existing markets. Sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to reach average annual company-owned restaurant sales, if at all, thereby affecting the profitability of these restaurants.\nOur operations are susceptible to the cost of and changes in food availability which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food costs. Various factors beyond our control, including adverse weather conditions, governmental regulation, production, availability, recalls of food products and seasonality may affect our food costs or cause a disruption in our supply chain. We enter into annual contracts with our chicken and other miscellaneous suppliers. Our contracts for chicken are fixed price contracts. Our contracts for beef are generally based on current market prices plus a processing fee. Changes in the price or availability of our all-natural chicken or beef supply or other commodities could materially adversely affect our profitability. We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we may not be able to pass along higher costs through price increases to our customers.\nMacroeconomic conditions could affect our operating results.\nIf the economy experiences an economic downturn or there are uncertainties regarding economic recovery, consumer spending and the unemployment rate may be affected, which may adversely affect our sales in the future. A proliferation of heavy discounting by our major competitors may also negatively affect our sales and operating results.\nPrice increases may impact customer visits.\nWe may make price increases on selected menu items in order to offset increased operating expenses we believe will be recurring. Although we have not experienced significant consumer resistance to our past price increases, future price increases may deter customers from visiting our restaurants or affect their purchasing decisions.\nThe hamburger restaurant market is highly competitive.\nThe hamburger restaurant market is highly competitive. Our competitors in the quick service restaurant segment include many recognized national and regional fast-food hamburger restaurant chains, such as McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, Wendy\u2019s, Carl\u2019s Jr., Sonic, Jack in the Box, Freddy\u2019s and Culver\u2019s. In-N-Out recently announced plans to expand into the state of Colorado, the primary state in which we operate. We also compete with small regional and local hamburger and other fast-food restaurants, many of which feature drive-through service. Most of our competitors have greater financial resources, marketing programs and name recognition than we do. Discounting by our quick service restaurant competitors may adversely affect the revenues and profitability of our restaurants.\nWhile Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar operates in the \u201cbetter burger\u201d restaurant segment, it offers a relatively broad menu and competes with other full-service restaurants such as Chili\u2019s, Red Robin and other local and regional full-service restaurants. Additionally, customers of both our Good Times restaurants and Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants are also customers of fast casual hamburger restaurants such as Five Guys Burgers & Fries and Smashburger. Further, changes in customer taste preferences, dietary trends, and preference for delivery and/or carry-out options often affect the restaurant business. If we are unable to continue to compete effectively with other restaurant concepts, our traffic, sales, and restaurant-level profitability could be negatively affected.\nSites for new restaurants may be difficult to acquire.\nLocating our restaurants in high-traffic and readily accessible areas is an important factor for our success. Our Good Times drive-through restaurants require sites with specific characteristics and there are a limited number of suitable sites available in our geographic markets. We intend to continue to locate Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants in leased in-line and end-cap retail locations in contrast to freestanding locations for Good Times locations. Since suitable locations are in great demand, in the future we may not be able to obtain optimal sites for either of our restaurant concepts at a reasonable cost. In addition, we cannot assure you that the sites we do obtain will be successful.\nIf our franchisees cannot develop or finance new restaurants, build them on suitable sites or open them on schedule, our growth and success may be impeded.\nFranchisees may not be able to negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the sites, obtain the necessary permits and government approvals or meet construction schedules. From time to time in the past, we have agreed to extend or modify development schedules and we may do so in the future. Any of these problems could slow our growth and reduce our franchise revenues. Additionally, our franchisees depend upon financing from banks and other financial institutions in order to construct and open new restaurants. Difficulty in obtaining adequate financing adversely affects the number and rate of new restaurant openings by our franchisees and adversely affects our future franchise revenues. We do not presently have any franchised restaurants under development.\nOur franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.\nFranchisees are independent contractors and are not our employees. We provide training and support to franchisees; however, franchisees operate their restaurants as independent businesses. Consequently, the quality of franchised restaurant operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. Moreover, franchisees may not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements, or may not hire and train qualified managers and other restaurant personnel. Our image and reputation, and the image and reputation of other franchisees, may suffer materially, and system-wide sales could significantly decline, if our franchisees do not operate successfully.\nWe depend on key management employees.\nWe believe our current operations and future success depend largely on the continued services of our management employees, in particular Boyd Hoback, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Ryan Zink, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan M. Knutson, our Controller and Corporate Secretary; and Scott LeFever, our Vice President of Operations for Good Times Drive-Thru Inc. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Hoback, Zink and LeFever and Ms. Knutson, they may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time. In addition, we do not currently maintain key-person insurance on Messrs. Hoback\u2019s, Zink, LeFever or Ms. Knutson\u2019s, life. The loss of Messrs. Hoback\u2019s, Zink\u2019s, LeFever\u2019s and Ms. Knutson\u2019s services, or other key management personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLabor shortages could slow our growth or harm our business.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified, high-energy employees. Qualified individuals needed to fill these positions are in short supply in some areas. The inability to recruit and retain these individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants or result in high employee turnover in existing restaurants, which could harm our business. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract sufficient employees, which could result in higher labor costs. Most of our employees are paid market wages on an hourly basis that are influenced by applicable minimum wage regulations. Accordingly, any increase in the minimum wage, whether state or federal, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation that may adversely hinder or impact our ability to govern various aspects of our business including our ability to expand and develop our restaurants.\nThe restaurant industry is subject to various federal, state and local government regulations, including those relating to the sale of food. Our failure to maintain necessary governmental licenses, permits and approvals, including food licenses, could adversely affect our operating results. Difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses and approvals could delay, or result in our decision to cancel, the opening of new restaurants. Local authorities may suspend or deny renewal of our food licenses if they determine that our conduct does not meet applicable standards or if there are changes in regulations.\nVarious federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs. These laws govern minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, meal and rest breaks, unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates, citizenship or residency requirements, child labor regulations and sales taxes. Additional government-imposed increases in minimum wages, overtime pay, paid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits may increase our operating costs. Several states, including Colorado where most of our restaurants are located, have recently increased their respective minimum wage and additional states may raise their respective minimum wage in the future. This could impact the profitability of existing restaurants as well as impact development opportunities in those states.\nThe federal Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. Although our restaurants are designed to be accessible to the disabled, we could be required to make modifications to our restaurants to provide service to, or make reasonable accommodations for, disabled persons.\nWe are also subject to federal and state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises and aspects of the licensor-licensee relationship. Many state franchise laws impose restrictions on the franchise agreement, including limitations on non-competition provisions and the termination or non-renewal of a franchise. Some states require that franchise materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in the state.\nOur Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants are also subject to state and local laws that regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages. Alcoholic beverage control regulations govern various aspects of these restaurants\u2019 daily operations, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing and inventory control, handling and storage. Typically, licenses to sell alcoholic beverages require annual renewal and may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause, the definition of which varies by locality. The failure of any of our Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants to timely obtain and maintain any required licenses, permits or approvals to serve alcoholic beverages could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant or prevent regular day-to-day operations, including the sale of alcoholic beverages, at a restaurant that is already operating, any of which would adversely affect our business.\nHealth concerns relating to the consumption of beef, chicken or other food products could affect consumer preferences and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nLike other restaurant chains, consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about the avian influenza, also known as bird flu, or the consumption of beef, the key ingredient in many of our menu items, or negative publicity concerning food quality, illness and injury generally, such as negative publicity concerning E. coli, \u201cmad cow\u201d or \u201cfoot-and-mouth\u201d disease, publication of government or industry findings concerning food products served by us, or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one restaurant or a limited number of restaurants. This negative publicity may adversely affect demand for our food and could result in a decrease in customer traffic to our restaurants. If we react to the negative publicity by changing our concept or our menu we may lose customers who do not prefer the new concept or menu, and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new customer base to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. In addition, we may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of a concept change and may not be able to compete successfully against those competitors. A decrease in customer traffic to our restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or concept could materially harm our business.\nOur ability to succeed with the Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurant concept will require significant capital expenditures and management attention.\nWe believe that new openings of Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants are likely to serve as a contributor of our new unit growth and increased profitability over the longer term based on the unit economics of that concept. Our ability to succeed with this new concept will require significant capital expenditures and management attention and is subject to certain risks in addition to those of opening a new Good Times restaurant, including customer acceptance of and competition with the Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar concept. If the \u201cramp-up\u201d period for new Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants does not meet our expectations, our operating results may be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop and grow the Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar concept to a point where it will become profitable or generate positive cash flow. We may not be able to attract enough customers to meet targeted levels of performance at new Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants because potential customers may be unfamiliar with the concept or the atmosphere or menu might not be appealing to them. If we cannot successfully execute our growth strategies for Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur growth, including the development of Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants, may strain our management and infrastructure.\nIn addition to new openings of Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants, we also plan to remodel and reimage existing Good Times restaurants. In addition, we believe there may be opportunities to open or franchise new Good Times restaurants from time to time. This growth will increase our operating complexity and place increased demands on our management and infrastructure, including our current restaurant management systems, financial and management controls, and information systems. If our infrastructure is insufficient to support our growth, our ability to open new restaurants, including the development of the Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar concept, would be adversely affected.\nBad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar is subject to all of the risks of a relatively new business, including competition, and there is no guarantee of a return on our capital investment.\nThe Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar concept has been in existence for approximately ten years. Existing restaurants are currently located in Colorado, Oklahoma, North Carolina and South Carolina. Because of the small number of existing Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants and the relatively short period of time that they have been in operation, there is substantial uncertainty that additional restaurants in other locations will be successful. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in offering Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar franchises throughout the U.S. or that, if and when such franchises are granted, the restaurants developed by franchisees will be successful. There is also substantial uncertainty that the franchising business will be successful in view of the facts that we have sold only two Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurant franchises to date and that the restaurant franchising business is very competitive.\nWe do not have a proven track record of operating in the \u201csmall box\u201d better burger casual dining segment.\nWe have historically operated in the quick service restaurant segment, while BDBB operates in the \u201csmall box\u201d better burger casual dining segment. We have operated a limited number of Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants since February 2014 and thus do not have a proven track record of operating in the \u201csmall box\u201d better burger casual dining. Realizing the contemplated benefits from expanding into a new segment of casual dining may take significant time and resources and may depend upon our ability to successfully develop familiarity in the \u201csmall box\u201d better burger casual dining segment.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders.\nDelta Partners, LP, REIT Redux, LP, and Manatuk Hill Partners, LLC together beneficially own approximately 30% of our outstanding common stock. This concentration of ownership and voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and therefore may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of significant stockholders or potential stockholders attempting to effect changes or acquire control over our company, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business strategy and impact the trading value of our securities.\nStockholders may from time to time attempt to effect changes, engage in proxy solicitations or advance stockholder proposals. For instance, on November 16, 2017, we received a notice from Delta Partners, LP and REIT Redux LP nominating seven persons for election to our board of directors at our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, consisting of four persons currently on the board of directors (two of whom are affiliated with Delta Partners and/or REIT Redux) and three additional persons who are not currently members of the board of directors. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies. Any of these impacts could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Further, the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties described above.\nFuture changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results and affect our reported results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. New pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or differing interpretations with respect to our current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.\nKeeping abreast of, and in compliance with, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new SEC regulations and The NASDAQ Market rules, has required an increased amount of management attention and expense. We remain committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards, and this investment has resulted in and will continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nIf our internal controls are not adequate, we may discover errors in our financial and other reporting that will require significant resources to remedy and could subject us to additional fines.\nPublic companies in the United States are required to review their internal controls as set forth in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. If the internal controls put in place by us are not adequate or in conformity with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), we may be forced to restate our financial statements and take other actions which will take significant financial and managerial resources, as well as be subject to fines and other government enforcement actions.\nBecause we currently qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d our non-financial and financial information are less than is required by non-smaller reporting companies.\nCurrently we qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company.\u201d The \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d category includes companies that 1) have a common equity public float of less than $75 million or 2) are unable to calculate their public float and have annual revenue of $50 million or less, upon entering the system. A smaller reporting company prepares and files SEC reports and registration statements using the same forms as other SEC reporting companies, though the information required to be disclosed may differ and be less comprehensive. Regulation S-X contains the SEC requirements for financial statements, while Regulation S-K contains the non-financial disclosure requirements.\nTo locate the scaled disclosure requirements, smaller reporting companies will refer to the special paragraphs labeled \u201csmaller reporting companies\u201d in Regulation S-K. As an example only, smaller reporting companies are not required to make risk factor disclosure in Item 1A of Form 10-K. Other disclosure required by non-smaller reporting companies can be omitted in Form 10-K and Form 10-Q by smaller reporting companies.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe trading price of our shares of common stock has from time-to-time fluctuated widely and in the future may be subject to similar fluctuations. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell your common stock. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including:\n\u00b7\noperating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in our business;\n\u00b7\nthe operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of implementation of strategic transactions or developments and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nnegative economic conditions that adversely affect the economy, commodity prices, the job market and other factors that may affect the markets in which we operate;\n\u00b7\npublication of research reports about us or the sectors in which we operate generally;\n\u00b7\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u00b7\nactions by institutional shareholders;\n\u00b7\nspeculation in the press or investment community; and\n\u00b7\nthe realization of any of the other risk factors included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHolders of our common stock will be subject to the risk of volatile and depressed market prices of our common stock. In addition, many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. These factors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects. It is impossible to assure investors in our common stock that the market price of our common stock will not fall in the future.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing shareholders could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise adequate capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of the shares of our common stock and/or dilute the value of shares of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing, and stockholder approval is not required in order to issue, additional shares of common stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of common stock, except any stockholder approval required by The NASDAQ Capital Markets. We have in the past, and may in the future, sell such equity and equity-linked securities. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market could depress the market price of our shares of common stock. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our shares of common stock. The market price of our common stock may be adversely affected if we issue additional shares of our common stock.\nYou may not receive dividends on the shares of our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We have no plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Nevada law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to anti-takeover laws for Nevada corporations. These anti-takeover laws prevent a Nevada corporation from engaging in a business combination with any stockholder, including all affiliates and associates of the stockholder, who is the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock, for two years following the date that the stockholder first became the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock, unless specified conditions are met. If those conditions are not met, then after the expiration of the two-year period the corporation may not engage in a business combination with such stockholder unless certain other conditions are met.\nOur articles of incorporation and our bylaws contain a number of provisions that may deter or impede takeovers or changes of control or management. These provisions:\n\u00b7\nauthorize our board of directors to establish one or more series of preferred stock the terms of which can be determined by the board of directors at the time of issuance;\n\u00b7\ndo not allow for cumulative voting in the election of directors unless required by applicable law. Under cumulative voting a minority stockholder holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares may be able to ensure the election of one or more directors;\n\u00b7\nstate that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the president or any two directors and must be called by the president upon the written request of the holders of 25% of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote at such special meeting; and\n\u00b7\nprovide that the authorized number of directors is no more than seven, as determined by our board of directors.\nThese provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to stockholders for their common stock.\nWe may issue debt and equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, any of which may be senior to our common stock as to distributions and liquidation.\nIn the future, we may issue debt or equity securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities, or we may enter into debt-like financing that is unsecured or secured by any or all of our properties. Such securities may be senior to our common stock with respect to distributions. In addition, in the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt and preferred securities would receive distributions of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 76360, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "GTIM"}
