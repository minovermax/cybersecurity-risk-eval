{"cik": "1076682", "company": "POLARITYTE, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business and operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties as described below. However, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we may currently deem immaterial, may become important factors that could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. If any of the following risks occur, our financial condition or results of operations could suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe will need additional funding to pursue the regulatory process for SkinTE and sustain our operations, and we may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce, eliminate, or abandon our product development program.\nWe reported an operating loss of $33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and on that date we had had an accumulated deficit of $508.4 million. We believe our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2021, will fund our current business plan including related operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through the end of the third calendar quarter of 2022. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern beyond that time unless we can raise additional capital from external sources.\nWe expect to incur significant operating costs in the near term as we pursue the regulatory process for SkinTE with the FDA, conduct clinical trials and studies, and pursue product research, all while operating our business and incurring continuing fixed costs related to the maintenance of our assets and business. We expect to incur significant losses in the future, and those losses could be more severe as a result of unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown events.\nIf adequate funds are not available for our business in the future, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate the plans for obtaining regulatory licensure or approval for SkinTE or be unable to continue operations over a longer term, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nWe discontinued sales of SkinTE and COVID-19 testing, and may make a disposition of IBEX, so we will be entirely dependent on capital obtained from outside sources to fund our operations.\nWe discontinued sales of SkinTE as a 361 HCT/P product at the end of May 2021 and discontinued COVID-19 testing through Arches in August 2021, and it is likely there will be some disposition of IBEX in 2022. As a result of these developments, in the near term we may not be engaged in any revenue generating activity that would contribute to defraying our operating costs, which will make us entirely dependent on capital obtained from external sources to fund our operations. The inability to obtain capital as needed to fund our operations could result in us curtailing or ceasing operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, and the value of an investment in us.\nOur wholly owned subsidiary accepted a loan under the CARES Act pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), and the loan may subject us to challenges, audits, or investigations regarding qualification for the loan, any of which could reduce our liquidity and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOn April 12, 2020, our subsidiary PolarityTE MD, Inc. (the \u201cPTE-MD\u201d) entered into a promissory note offered by a bank (the \u201cLender\u201d) evidencing an unsecured loan in the amount of $3,576,145 made to PTE-MD under the PPP (the \u201cLoan\u201d). On October 15, 2020, PTE-MD applied to the Lender for forgiveness of the PPP Loan in its entirety (as provided for in the CARES Act) based on PTE-MD\u2019s use of the PPP Loan for payroll costs, rent, and utilities. On October 26, 2020, PTE-MD was advised that the Lender approved the application, and that the Lender was submitting the application to the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) for a final decision. The SBA subsequently approved PTE-MD\u2019s application for forgiveness of the PPP Loan, and the principal and interest of $3,612,376 was fully paid by the SBA on June 12, 2021.\nPursuant to the requirements under the CARES Act, in connection with the PPP Loan PTE-MD certified that current economic uncertainty made the Loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of PTE-MD. We believe that certification was made in a manner consistent with SBA guidance that borrowers must make the certification in good faith, taking into account their current business activity and their ability to access other sources of liquidity sufficient to support their ongoing operations in a manner that is not significantly detrimental to the business. In connection with PTE-MD\u2019s application for forgiveness of the PPP Loan, it provided information on the use of the PPP Loan proceeds for payroll costs, rent, and utilities, which are permitted uses to qualify for forgiveness of the loan.\nUnder the CARES Act, the SBA may review any PPP loan of any size at any time at its discretion. On September 17, 2021, PTE-MD received notice from the Lender that the SBA is continuing to review the PPP Loan. As part of this review, the SBA requested that PTE-MD provide documents that it is required to maintain but may not have been required to submit with its application for the PPP Loan. These documents included an affiliation worksheet showing the relationship between PolarityTE and PTE-MD and affiliated subsidiaries, documents showing the use of the PPP Loan proceeds, documents showing PTE-MD\u2019s calculation of the loan amount it requested in its loan application, its federal tax returns, and documents showing employee compensation information. PTE-MD submitted the documents to the SBA through the Lender on September 28, 2021.\nThere is no assurance the SBA will conclude PTE-MD properly applied for, and used the proceeds of, the PPP Loan. If there is any adverse finding in the SBA review or if PTE-MD were alleged, or determined, not to qualify for the Loan or alleged, or found, to have made false certifications in connection with the PPP Loan and its forgiveness, PTE-MD could be required to return the full amount of the Loan, which would reduce its liquidity, and could subject it to fines and penalties, and exclusion from government contracts. In particular, PTE-MD may become subject to actions under the FCA, including its qui tam provisions, which, among other things, prohibits persons from knowingly filing, or knowingly causing to be filed, a false statement, or knowingly using a false statement, to obtain payment from the federal government. Violations of the FCA are subject to treble damages and penalties. In the case of an SBA loan, the government could allege that single damages are the amount of the loan and interest thereon (or more), which under the FCA could then be trebled. Substantial penalties must also be imposed for each submitted false statement when a defendant loses an FCA trial. FCA cases may be initiated by the U.S. Department of Justice or by private persons or entities, often called \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d who bring the action on behalf of the U.S. PTE-MD may also face enforcement arising under other federal statutes, including criminal laws, and administrative actions and investigations initiated by SBA or other governmental entities. Furthermore, if PTE-MD is identified as an entity that the media, government officials, or others seek to portray as a business that should not have availed itself of PPP funding, PTE-MD may face negative publicity, which could have a materially adverse impact on its business and operations and on PolarityTE\u2019s business and operations as its parent. Generally, the cost of defending claims under the FCA, regardless of merit, could be substantial, even as much as the PPP loan proceeds.\nRisks Related to our Research & Development, Clinical, and Commercialization Activities\nOur product is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, which can be costly and time consuming, cause unanticipated delays or prevent the receipt of the required licensures and approvals to commercialize our product.\nThe preclinical and clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing, and distribution of SkinTE is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other U.S. regulatory agencies, or comparable authorities in foreign markets. In the U.S., we are not permitted, directly or through others, to market our product until the FDA approves a BLA for SkinTE and licenses the product. Similar approval is required in foreign jurisdictions. The process of obtaining these approvals is uncertain, dependent on future clinical trial results, expensive, often takes many years, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product candidate involved. Approval policies or regulations may change and may be influenced by the results of other similar or competitive products, making it more difficult for us to achieve such approval in a timely manner or at all. Any guidance that may result from FDA advisory committee discussions may make it more difficult or expensive to develop and commercialize SkinTE. In addition, as a company, we have not previously filed a BLA with the FDA or filed a similar application with other foreign regulatory agencies. This lack of experience may impede our ability to obtain FDA or other foreign regulatory agency licensure or approval in a timely manner, if at all, for our product.\nDespite the time and expense invested, regulatory approval is never guaranteed. The FDA or comparable foreign authorities can delay, limit, or deny approval or licensure of a product candidate for many reasons, including:\n\u25cf a product candidate for a BLA may not be deemed safe, pure, and potent;\n\u25cf agency officials of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not find the data from non-clinical or preclinical studies and clinical trials generated during development to be sufficient;\n\u25cf the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not approve manufacturing processes or may determine that the manufacturing facilities are not compliant with cGMP; or\n\u25cf the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nOur inability to obtain these approvals would prevent us from commercializing our product.\nThe FDA regulatory approval process is lengthy and time-consuming, and PolarityTE could experience significant delays or other challenges in the clinical development and regulatory licensures or approval of its product.\nWe may experience delays or other challenges in commencing and completing clinical trials for SkinTE that would be necessary for product licensure or approval. We do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll trial subjects on time or in sufficient numbers, or be completed on schedule, if at all. Any of our future clinical trials may be delayed or precluded for a variety of reasons, including issues related to:\n\u25cf the availability of financial resources for commencing and completing planned clinical trials;\n\u25cf reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf obtaining and maintaining approval of each reviewing institutional review board (\u201cIRB\u201d);\n\u25cf obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for clinical trials in each country;\n\u25cf recruiting sufficient numbers of suitable trial subjects to participate in clinical trials;\n\u25cf competing priorities at clinical trial sites or departures of study investigators or personnel;\n\u25cf having trial subjects complete a clinical trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u25cf clinical trial sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n\u25cf adding new clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf developing one or more new formulations or routes of administration; or\n\u25cf manufacturing sufficient quantities of our product candidate for use in clinical trials.\nTrial subject enrollment, a significant factor in the timing and success of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the trial subject population, the proximity of trial subjects to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial, the potential impact of COVID-19 or other pandemic, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians, and trial subjects\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any therapies that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. In addition, significant numbers of trial subjects who enroll in our clinical trials may drop out during the clinical trials for various reasons. We endeavor to account for dropout rates in our trials when determining expected clinical trial timelines, but we cannot assure you that our assumptions are correct, or that trials will not experience higher numbers of dropouts than anticipated, which would result in the delay of completion of such trials beyond our expected timelines, if at all.\nWe could encounter delays if physicians encounter unresolved ethical issues associated with enrolling trial subjects in clinical trials of our product candidate in lieu of prescribing existing treatments that have established safety and efficacy profiles. Further, a clinical trial may be delayed, suspended, or terminated by us, any reviewing IRB, the institutions in which such trial is conducted, the data monitoring committee for such trial, or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including inadequate protocols or other information supporting an IND, failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, GCP, or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product candidate, changes in governmental regulations, or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. Furthermore, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a termination or delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory licensure or approval of a product. In connection with clinical trials, we face additional risks that:\n\u25cf there may be slower than expected rates of trial subject recruitment and enrollment;\n\u25cf trial subjects may fail to complete the clinical trials;\n\u25cf there may be an inability or unwillingness of trial subjects or medical investigators to follow our clinical trial protocols;\n\u25cf there may be an inability to monitor trial subjects adequately during or after treatment;\n\u25cf conditions of trial subjects may deteriorate rapidly or unexpectedly, which may cause the trial subjects to become ineligible for a clinical trial or may prevent our product from demonstrating the regulatory standard of safety, purity, and potency;\n\u25cf trial subjects may die or suffer other adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to our product being tested;\n\u25cf we may not be able to sufficiently standardize certain of the tests and procedures that are part of our clinical trials because such tests and procedures are highly specialized and involve a high degree of expertise;\n\u25cf the clinical trials may not be able to commence, or to proceed, because of problems with compliance with cGMP at the manufacturing facilities;\n\u25cf a product candidate may not prove to be efficacious in all or some trial subject populations;\n\u25cf the results of the clinical trials may not confirm the results of earlier trials;\n\u25cf the results of the clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies;\n\u25cf there may be data discrepancies or documentation issues in the clinical trials that raise questions about data integrity or reliability; and\n\u25cf a product candidate may not have a favorable risk/benefit assessment in the disease areas studied.\nWe cannot assure you that any future clinical trial for our product will be started or completed successfully, on schedule, or at all. If we experience suspension or termination of, or delays in the completion of, any clinical trial for our product, the commercial prospects for the product will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed or diminished. In addition, any delays in initiating or completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations significantly.\nChanges in funding for the FDA and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve or license new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including (i) government budget and funding levels, as well as government shutdowns, (ii) the ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and (iii) statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new products to be reviewed or licensed or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, over the last several years, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused unexpected increases in the FDA\u2019s workload and has degraded the timeliness of many agency activities, including pre-submission interactions, product reviews, and pre-license inspections.\nEven if we obtain and maintain regulatory licensure or approval for our product in one jurisdiction, it may never obtain regulatory licensure or approval for the product in any other jurisdiction, which would limit our market opportunities and adversely affect our business.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory licensure or approval for our product in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory licensure or approval in other jurisdictions. For example, even if the FDA grants marketing approval for SkinTE, comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries must also approve the manufacturing, marketing, and promotion of the product in those countries. Approval procedures vary amongst jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the U.S., including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties, and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our product in certain countries. In many countries outside the U.S., a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our product is also subject to approval. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets or fail to receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product will be harmed, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEven if our product candidate receives regulatory licensure or approval, our product candidate may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nIf our product receives regulatory approval, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of the product or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies and trials or other risk mitigation measures. In addition, regulatory agencies subject a product, its manufacturer, and the manufacturer\u2019s facilities to continual review and periodic inspections. If a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated nature, severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, stored, tested, or released, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or PolarityTE, including narrowing product indications, requiring labeled warnings, or requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. Our product candidate will also be subject to ongoing FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities\u2019 requirements for labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, record-keeping, import, export, clinical trial registration and results disclosure for post-market as well as pre-market trials, and submission of safety and other post-market information. If our product fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u25cf issue warning letters or other notices of possible violations;\n\u25cf impose civil or criminal penalties or fines or seek disgorgement of revenue or profits;\n\u25cf suspend or terminate any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25cf refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our licensees;\n\u25cf withdraw any regulatory licensures or approvals;\n\u25cf impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements, or shut down our manufacturing operations; or\n\u25cf seize or detain product or require a product recall.\nThe FDA and comparable foreign authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses and other unlawful promotion.\nThe FDA and comparable foreign authorities strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about products, such as SkinTE, if licensed or approved. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling and may not be promoted with claims that are false, misleading, or inadequately substantiated. If we receive marketing approval for our product for its proposed indications, physicians may nevertheless use our product for their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label, if the physicians believe in their professional medical judgment that our product could be used in such manner.\nHowever, if we are found to have promoted our product for any off-label uses, or with claims that are false, misleading, or not adequately substantiated, the federal government could levy civil, criminal, or administrative penalties, and seek to impose fines on us. Such enforcement has become more common in the industry. The FDA or comparable foreign authorities could also request that we enter into a consent decree or a corporate integrity agreement or seek a permanent injunction against us under which specified promotional conduct is monitored, changed, or curtailed. If we cannot successfully manage the promotion of our product, if licensed or approved, we could become subject to significant liability, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nPolarityTE, and any contract manufacturer it may engage in the future, are subject to significant regulation with respect to manufacturing PolarityTE\u2019s product. Even once cGMP compliance is initially achieved, the manufacturing facility on which PolarityTE relies may not continue to meet regulatory requirements.\nEntities involved in the preparation of products subject to BLA approval for clinical trials or commercial sale, including us and any contract manufacturer we may engage in the future, are subject to extensive regulation. Products sold commercially after BLA approval or used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. cGMP laws and regulations govern manufacturing facilities, processes, and procedures and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Poor control of production processes or facilities can lead to the introduction of contaminants or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of our product candidate that may not be detectable in final product testing. We, or our contract manufacturers, must supply all necessary documentation on a timely basis in support of a BLA or a change in manufacturing site after a BLA is issued on a timely basis and must adhere to cGMP statutory requirements and regulations enforced by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities through their facilities inspection program. The facilities and quality systems of our facility where we will manufacture SkinTE must pass a pre-license inspection for compliance with the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements as a condition of regulatory licensure or approval of our product. In addition, the regulatory authorities may, at any time, with or without cause, audit, inspect, or conduct a remote review of records or information about a manufacturing facility involved with the preparation of our product or the associated quality systems for compliance with the statute or regulations applicable to the activities being conducted. If our facility does not pass a pre-license plant inspection, regulatory licensure or approval of our product may not be granted or may be substantially delayed until any deficiencies are corrected to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority, if ever. If we engage contract manufacturers in the future, we intend to oversee the contract manufacturers, but we cannot control the manufacturing process and will be completely dependent on our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with the regulatory requirements.\nThe regulatory authorities also may, at any time following approval of a product for sale, audit, inspect, or remotely review records regarding our facility or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contractors. If any such inspection, audit, or review identifies a failure to comply with applicable statute or regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable statute or regulations occurs independent of such an inspection, audit, or review, we or the relevant regulatory authority may require remedial measures that may be costly or time consuming for us or a third party to implement, and may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or commercial sales or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. Any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we or any of our third-party manufacturers fail to maintain regulatory compliance, the FDA or comparable foreign authorities can impose regulatory sanctions including, among other things, refusal to approve a pending application for a product candidate, withdrawal of an approval, or suspension of production. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nAdditionally, if supply from our facility or the facility of a future contract manufacturer is interrupted, an alternative manufacturer would need to be qualified through a BLA supplement, or equivalent foreign regulatory filing, which could result in further delay. The regulatory agencies may also require additional studies or trials if a new manufacturer is relied upon for commercial production. Switching manufacturing facilities may involve substantial costs and is likely to result in a delay in our desired clinical and commercial timelines.\nThese factors could cause us to incur higher costs and could cause the delay or termination of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals, or commercialization of our product. Furthermore, if our facility or future contract manufacturers fail to meet production requirements and we is unable to secure one or more replacement manufacturing facilities capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost or at all, our clinical trials may be delayed, or we could lose potential revenue.\nIf we fail to obtain and sustain an adequate level of reimbursement for our product by third-party payors, potential future sales would be materially adversely affected.\nThere will be no viable commercial market for our product, if approved, without reimbursement from third-party payors. Reimbursement policies may be affected by future healthcare reform measures. We cannot be certain that reimbursement will be available for our product. Additionally, even if there is a viable commercial market, if the level of reimbursement is below our expectations, our anticipated revenue and gross margins will be adversely affected. Third-party payors, such as government or private healthcare insurers, carefully review and increasingly question and challenge the coverage of and the prices charged for drugs. Reimbursement rates from private health insurance companies vary depending on the company, the insurance plan, and other factors. Reimbursement rates may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. There is a current trend in the U.S. healthcare industry toward cost containment.\nLarge public and private payors, managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, and similar organizations are exerting increasing influence on decisions regarding the use of, and reimbursement levels for, particular treatments. Such third-party payors, including Medicare, may question the coverage of, and challenge the prices charged for, medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit coverage of or reimbursement for newly approved healthcare products. In particular, third-party payors may limit the covered indications. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products, which could result in product revenues being lower than anticipated. If we are unable to show a significant benefit relative to existing therapies, Medicare, Medicaid, and private payors may not be willing to provide reimbursement for our product, which would significantly reduce the likelihood of our product gaining market acceptance.\nWe expect that private insurers will consider the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of our product in determining whether to approve reimbursement and at what level. Obtaining these approvals can be a time consuming and expensive process. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially adversely affected if we do not receive approval for reimbursement of our product from private insurers on a timely or satisfactory basis. Limitations on coverage could also be imposed at the local Medicare carrier level or by fiscal intermediaries. Medicare Part D, which provides a pharmacy benefit to Medicare patients as discussed below, does not require participating prescription drug plans to cover all drugs within a class of products. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if Part D prescription drug plans were to limit access to, or deny or limit reimbursement of, our product.\nReimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In many countries, the product cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved. In some foreign markets, prescription drug pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. The negotiation process in some countries can be very long. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our products to other available therapies.\nIf the prices for our product are reduced or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement of our product, our future revenue, cash flows, and prospects for profitability will suffer.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost of commercializing our product and may affect the prices we may obtain if our product is approved for commercialization.\nIn the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of adopted and proposed legislative and regulatory changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay regulatory licensure or approval of our product, restrict or regulate post-marketing activities, and affect our ability to profitably sell our product.\nIn the U.S., the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (\u201cMMA\u201d) changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could limit the coverage and reimbursement rate that we receive for our product. While the MMA only applies to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cPPACA\u201d) was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry, and impose additional health policy reforms. The PPACA increased manufacturers\u2019 rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate amount for both branded and generic drugs and revised the definition of Average Manufacturer Price, which may also increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates manufacturers are required to pay to states. The legislation also expanded Medicaid drug rebates and created an alternative rebate formula for certain new formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the rebates due on those drugs. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which administer the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, also proposed to expand Medicaid rebates to the utilization that occurs in the territories of the U.S., such as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Further, beginning in 2011, the PPACA imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products and required manufacturers to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of prescriptions filled by beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, referred to as the \u201cdonut hole.\u201d Legislative and regulatory proposals have been introduced at both the state and federal level to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products.\nThere have been prior public announcements by members of the federal government regarding their plans to repeal and replace the PPACA and Medicare. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the individual mandate requiring most Americans (other than those who qualify for a hardship exemption) to carry a minimum level of health coverage, effective January 1, 2019. We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance, or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing approval testing and other requirements.\nWe are subject to \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d and similar laws and regulations, and a failure to comply with such regulations or prevail in any adverse claim or proceeding related to noncompliance could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn the U.S., we are subject to various federal and state healthcare \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, and other laws intended, among other things, to reduce fraud and abuse in federal and state healthcare programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a drug or biologics manufacturer, or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or prescription of a particular drug or biologic, or other good or service, for which payment in whole or in part may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Although we seek to structure our business arrangements in compliance with all applicable requirements, these laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how the law will be applied in specific circumstances. Accordingly, it is possible that our practices may be challenged under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.\nThe federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing to be presented for payment to the government, including the federal healthcare programs, claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services that were not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, we are prohibited from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services to obtain money or property of any healthcare benefit program. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including penalties, fines, or exclusion or suspension from federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states.\nMany states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not just governmental payors. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America\u2019s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement, we could be subject to penalties.\nLaw enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing these laws, and it is possible that as we pursue our business we may be challenged under these laws. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. If we are found in violation of one of these laws, we could be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from governmental funded federal or state healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If this occurs, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we face allegations of noncompliance with the law and encounter sanctions, our reputation, revenues, and liquidity may suffer, and our product, if approved for commercialization, could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from our product, if approved. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory licensure or approval is not granted or is withdrawn, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be adversely affected. Additionally, if we are unable to generate revenues from product sales, our potential for achieving profitability will be diminished and our need to raise capital to fund our operations will increase.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain and may be inadequate, which could have a material and adverse effect on us.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights in technologies that presently consist of trade secrets, patents, and patent applications. We currently have three issued patents and one allowed patent application in the U.S. relating to our minimally polarized functional unit (\u201cMPFU\u201d) technology. We intend to continue our patenting activities and rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws and nondisclosure, confidentiality, and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology, and there can be no assurance these methods of protection will be effective. These legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive benefit. The patent application process can be time consuming and expensive. We cannot ensure that any of the pending patent applications already filed or that may be filed or acquired will result in issued patents. Competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop procedures that provide outcomes that are comparable or even superior to ours. There is no assurance that the inventors of the patents and applications were the first-to-invent or the first-inventor-to-file on the inventions, or that a third party will not claim ownership in one of our patents or patent applications. We cannot assure you that a third party does not have or will not obtain patents that could preclude us from practicing the patents we own or license now or in the future.\nThe failure to obtain and maintain patents or protect our intellectual property rights could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We cannot be certain that, if challenged, any patents we have obtained or ultimately obtain would be upheld because a determination of the validity and enforceability of a patent involves complex issues of fact and law. If one or more of any patents we have obtained or ultimately obtain is invalidated or held unenforceable, such an outcome could reduce or eliminate any competitive benefit we might otherwise have had.\nIn the event a competitor infringes upon any patent we have obtained or ultimately obtain, or a third party including but not limited to a university or other research institution, makes a claim of ownership over our patents or other intellectual property rights, confirming, defending, or enforcing those rights may be costly, uncertain, difficult, and time consuming.\nThere can be no assurance that a third party, including, but not limited to, a university or other research institution that our founders were associated with in the past, will not make claims to ownership or other claims related to our technology.\nThere can be no assurance that a third party, including but not limited to, a university or other research institution that our founders were associated with in the past, will not make claims to ownership or other claims related to our technology. We believe we have developed our technology outside of any institutions, but we cannot guarantee such institutions would not assert a claim to the contrary. Even if successful, litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights could be expensive and time consuming and could divert our management\u2019s attention. Further, bringing litigation for patent enforcement subjects us to the potential for counterclaims. If one or more of our current or future patents is challenged in U.S. or foreign courts or the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or foreign patent offices, the patent(s) may be found invalid or unenforceable, which could harm our competitive position. If any court or any patent office ultimately cancels or narrows the claims in any of our patents through any pre- or post-grant patent proceedings, such an outcome could prevent or hinder us from being able to enforce the patent against competitors. Such adverse decisions could negatively affect our future revenue and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully appropriated, used, or disclosed intellectual property of their former employers.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed by other companies, universities, or academic institutions. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a prior employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to claims that former or current employees, collaborators, or other third parties have an interest in our patents, patent applications, or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. Litigation may be necessary to defend against any claims challenging inventorship. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how related to SkinTE or any of our product candidates, our competitive position would be impaired and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSome of our technology, including our knowledge regarding certain aspects of the manufacture of SkinTE and potential product candidates, is unpatented and is maintained by us as trade secrets. To protect these trade secrets, the information is restricted to our employees, consultants, collaborators, and advisors on a need-to-know basis. In addition, we require our employees, consultants, collaborators, and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements, however, do not ensure protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information, and these agreements may be breached. A breach of confidentiality could affect our competitive position. In addition, in some situations, these agreements and other obligations of our employees to assign intellectual property to us may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants, collaborators, or advisors have previous employment or consulting relationships. Also, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.\nAdequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. The disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may become subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, which could prohibit us from developing our product, require us to obtain licenses from third parties, require us to develop non-infringing alternatives, or subject us to substantial monetary damages.\nThird parties could assert that our processes, SkinTE, product candidates, or technology infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. Whether a process, product, or technology infringes a patent or other intellectual property involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain. We cannot be certain that we will not be found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. Because patent applications may remain unpublished for certain periods of time and may take years to be issued as patents, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware or that do not currently contain claims of concern that may later result in issued patents that SkinTE, our product candidates, procedures, or processes will infringe. There may be existing patents that SkinTE, our product candidates, procedures, or processes infringe, of which infringement we are not aware. Third parties could also assert ownership over our intellectual property. Such an ownership claim could cause us to incur significant costs to litigate the ownership issues. If an ownership claim by a third party were upheld as valid, we may be unable to obtain a license from the third party on acceptable terms to continue to make, use, or sell technology free from claims by that third party of infringement of the third party\u2019s intellectual property. We have not obtained, and do not have a present intention to obtain, any legal opinion regarding our freedom to practice our technology.\nIf we are unsuccessful in actions we bring against the patents of other parties, and it is determined that we infringe upon the patents of third parties, we may be subject to injunctions, or otherwise prevented from commercializing potential products or services in the relevant jurisdiction or may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or develop or obtain alternative technologies, any of which could harm our business. Furthermore, if such challenges to our patent rights are not resolved in our favor, we could be delayed or prevented from entering into new collaborations or from commercializing certain product candidates, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property in countries outside of the U.S.\nIntellectual property law outside the U.S. is uncertain and, in many countries, is currently undergoing review and revisions. The laws of some countries do not protect patent and other intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. Third parties may challenge our patents or applications in foreign countries by initiating pre- and post-grant oppositions or invalidation proceedings. Developments during opposition or invalidation proceedings in one country may directly or indirectly affect a corresponding patent or patent application in another country in an adverse manner. It may be necessary or useful for us to participate in proceedings to determine the validity of our patents or our competitors\u2019 patents that have been issued in countries other than the U.S. This could result in substantial costs, divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nGeneral Risks\nWe have one facility for the production of SkinTE for our clinical trials, so if this facility is destroyed or it experiences any manufacturing or laboratory difficulties, disruptions, or delays, this could adversely affect our ability to conduct our clinical trials.\nManufacturing of SkinTE takes place at our single U.S. facility. If regulatory, manufacturing, or other problems cause us to discontinue production operations at this facility, we would not be able to supply SkinTE for clinical trials, which would adversely impact our business. If this facility or the equipment in it is significantly damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, power loss, or similar events, we may not be able to replace our manufacturing capacity quickly or inexpensively, or at all. In the event of a temporary or protracted loss of this facility or equipment, we might not be able to quickly transfer manufacturing to a third party. Even if we could transfer manufacturing, the shift would likely be expensive and time-consuming, particularly since an alternative facility would need to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing and quality requirements and, if applicable, FDA approval would be required before any products manufactured at that facility could be used.\nOur success depends on members of our senior management team and the loss of one or more key employees or an inability to attract and retain skilled employees will negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical and other personnel. We are highly dependent upon certain members of senior management and other key personnel. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers, each of them may terminate employment with us at any time. The replacement of any of our key personnel likely would involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could, therefore, negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We do not carry any key person insurance policies that could offset potential loss of service under applicable circumstances.\nWe have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we do. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees have or we have breached legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources to disputes and litigation and, potentially, result in liability.\nJob candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our stock awards decline, it may harm our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially affect our operations, as well as the business or operations of third parties with whom we conduct business.\nThe impact of COVID-19, including the impact of restrictions imposed to combat its spread, could result in businesses shutting down, additional work restrictions, and reduced capacity and access to healthcare facilities, in particular as new COVID-19 variants such as the Delta and Omicron and other new variants spread. Depending upon the length of COVID-19 surges and resulting work restrictions and limitations on healthcare facilities, our future clinical trials for SkinTE may be adversely affected by: (i) delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials approved under our IND; (ii) delays or difficulties in clinical site activation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site personnel; (iii) delays in clinical sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct the clinical trials, including interruption in shipping that may affect the transport of our clinical trial product; (iv) changes in local regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 pandemic that may require us to change the ways in which our clinical trials are to be conducted, which may result in unexpected costs or discontinuance of the clinical trials altogether; (v) diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials; (vi) interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers, and others, or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures, the occurrence of which could affect the integrity or reliability of clinical trial data; (vii) risk that participants enrolled in our clinical trials will acquire COVID-19 while clinical trials are ongoing, which could impact the results of the clinical trials, including by increasing the number of observed adverse events; (viii) risk that clinical trial investigators or other site staff will acquire COVID-19 while the clinical trial is ongoing, which could impede the conduct or progress of the clinical trials; (ix) delays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees, and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees; (x) limitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our clinical trial because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people; (xi) and interruption or delays to our clinical trial activities.\nWe may not be able to enforce our patent or intellectual property rights against third parties, which could adversely affect the trading price for our common stock.\nSuccessful challenge of any patents or future patents or patent applications such as through opposition, reexamination, inter partes review, interference, or derivation proceedings could result in a loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Unauthorized disclosure of our claims to our trade secrets could result in loss of those intellectual property rights. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required relating to intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential or sensitive information could be compromised by disclosure in the event of litigation. In addition, during litigation there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive that we have lost rights to our intellectual property or the results of these disputes are negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nIn the event that we fail to satisfy any of the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted, which could affect our market price and liquidity.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. For continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we will be required to comply with the continued listing requirements, including the minimum market capitalization standard, the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirement, the corporate governance requirements, and the minimum closing bid price requirement, among other requirements. On August 13, 2021, we received a deficiency letter from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department (the \u201cStaff\u201d) of the Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) notifying us that we did not meet the $1.00 per share minimum bid price requirement for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cMinimum Bid Price Requirement\u201d). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we were provided an initial period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, which ended February 9, 2022. On February 10, 2022, we received an additional notice from the Staff stating that, although we had not regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule by February 9, 2022, the Staff determined in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) that we are eligible for an additional 180 calendar days from the date of that notice, or until August 8, 2022, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. To regain compliance, the bid price for the Company\u2019s common stock must close at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days.\nTo resolve the noncompliance, we may consider available options, including effecting a reverse stock split, which may not result in a permanent increase in the market price of our common stock and is dependent on many factors, including general economic, market, and industry conditions, the timing and results of our clinical trials, regulatory developments, and other factors detailed from time to time in the reports we file with the SEC. It is not uncommon for the market price of a company\u2019s shares to decline in the period following a reverse stock split. Furthermore, implementation of a reverse stock split requires approval of a majority of the outstanding voting power of our capital stock, and there is no assurance we can obtain that approval.\nIn the event that we fail to satisfy any of the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market our common stock may be delisted, and our current deficiency in meeting the Minimum Bid Price Requirement could result in our common stock being delisted in August 2022 if we are unable to resolve that deficiency. If our securities are delisted from trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, and we are not able to list our securities on another exchange or to have them quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market, our common stock could be quoted on the OTC Markets or on the Pink Open Market. As a result, we could face significant adverse consequences including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf a determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which would require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage;\n\u25cf a decreased ability to obtain additional financing because we would be limited to seeking capital from investors willing to invest in securities not listed on a national exchange; and\n\u25cf the inability to use short-form registration statements on Form S-3, including the registration statement on Form S-3 we filed in February 2022, to facilitate offerings of our securities.\nWe will need to issue additional equity securities in the future, which may result in dilution to existing investors and investors purchasing securities in this offering.\nWe expect to seek the additional capital necessary to fund our future operations through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, and collaborative and licensing arrangements. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, including in a debt financing where we issue convertible notes or notes with warrants and any shares of our common stock to be issued in a private placement, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We expect to sell additional equity securities from time to time in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine. If we sell additional equity securities, existing stockholders may be materially diluted. In addition, new investors could gain rights superior to existing stockholders, such as liquidation and other preferences.\nIn addition, the exercise or conversion of outstanding options or warrants to purchase shares of capital stock may result in dilution to our stockholders upon any such exercise or conversion. As of March 25, 2022, we had a significant number of securities convertible into, or allowing the purchase of, our common stock, including 9,836,067 shares reserved for issuance upon conversion of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, 35,500,843 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, 8,911,879 options and rights to acquire shares of our common stock that are outstanding under our equity incentive plans, and 4,097,401 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans.\nBecause we do not expect to declare cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, stockholders must rely on appreciation of the value of our common stock for any return on their investment.\nWhile we have in the past declared and paid cash dividends on our capital stock, we currently anticipate that it will retain future earnings for the development, operation, and expansion of our business and do not expect to declare or pay any additional cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, only appreciation of the public trading price of our common stock, if any, will provide a return to investors.", "PERMNO": 90539, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PTE"}
