{"cik": "8947", "company": "AZZ INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-04-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a variety of risks, including but not limited to the risks described below, which we believe are the most significant risks and uncertainties facing our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below may also impair our business operations in the future. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and future growth could be negatively or materially impacted.\nOur business segments operate in highly competitive markets.\nMany of our competitors, primarily in our Energy Segment, are significantly larger and have substantially more resources than AZZ. Competition is based on a number of factors, including price. Certain of our competitors may have lower cost structures and may, therefore, be able to provide their products and services at lower prices than we are able to provide. We cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services or products that are superior in price, delivery time or quality in the future. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within our industries, maintain our customer base at current levels or increase our customer base.\nOur operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nOur quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by:\n\u2022\nthe timing and volume of work under new or existing agreements;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the budgetary spending of customers, including seasonality;\n\u2022\nvariations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter;\n\u2022\nlosses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance;\n\u2022\ndelays of raw materials or component suppliers;\n\u2022\na change in the demand or production of our products and our services caused by severe weather conditions;\n\u2022\na change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;\n\u2022\nchanges in customer delivery schedules;\n\u2022\nunstable political economic conditions and public health issues delaying customer operations;\n\u2022\nincreases in design, manufacturing or transportation costs; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of customers to pay their invoices when owed to us.\nAccordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results expected for any other quarter or for the entire year.\nWe may be unsuccessful at implementing and generating internal growth from our Strategic Growth Initiatives.\nOur ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to:\n\u2022\nattract new customers, internationally and domestically;\n\u2022\nintegrate regulatory changes;\n\u2022\nincrease the number or size of projects performed for existing customers;\n\u2022\nhire and retain employees; and\n\u2022\nincrease volume utilizing our existing facilities.\nMany of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth through our initiatives may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or that we will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth. If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business.\nThe departure of key personnel could disrupt our business.\nWe depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and senior management team. We cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. The future loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business.\nOur business requires skilled labor, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.\nOur ability to maintain our productivity and profitability could be limited by an inability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our labor requirements. We may experience shortages of qualified personnel. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy or that our labor expense will not increase as a result of shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. Labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our profit margins or sustain and grow our revenues.\nActual and potential claims, lawsuits, and proceedings could ultimately reduce our profitability and liquidity and negatively impact our financial condition.\nIn the future, the Company could be named as a defendant in legal proceedings claiming damages from us in connection with the operation of our business. Most of the actions against us arise out of the normal course of business related to commercial disputes regarding the equipment we manufacture or the services we provide. We could potentially be a plaintiff in legal proceedings against customers, in which we seek to recover payments of contractual amounts due to us, and indemnity claims for increased costs or damages incurred by our Company. When appropriate, we establish provisions against certain legal exposures, and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to ongoing developments related to each case. If in the future our assumptions and estimates related to such exposures prove to be inadequate or incorrect, or we have material adverse claims or lawsuits, they could harm our business reputation, divert management resources away from operating our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.\nTechnological innovations by competitors may make existing products and production methods obsolete.\nAll of the manufactured products and services sold by the Company depend upon the best available technology for success in the marketplace. The competitive environment is highly sensitive to technological innovation in both segments of our business. It is possible for our competitors, both foreign and domestic, to develop new products, production methods or technology which would make our current products, services or methods obsolete or at least hasten their obsolescence or materially reduce our competitive advantage in the markets that we serve.\nCatastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from acts of war and terrorism, natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, or the outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic or contagious diseases such as the recent novel coronavirus, could potentially cause disruptions in our business. These disruptions could include the temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers or suppliers and their contract manufacturers, which could restrict to our ability to complete projects on schedule. Any disruption of our customers or suppliers and their contract manufacturers could likely impact our sales and operating results. In addition, continued pandemic, or the spread of any other contagious diseases could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, and result in an economic downturn that could affect the demand for our products and services. These situations are outside of the Company\u2019s control and any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur operations could be adversely impacted by the effects of future changes to the law and government regulations regarding emissions, the global environment and other sustainability matters.\nVarious regulations have been implemented regarding emissions, the global environment and other sustainability matters. We cannot predict future changes in the law and government regulations regarding emissions, the global environment and other sustainability matters, , or what actions may be taken by our customers or other industry participants in response to any future legislation. Such changes in the laws, governmental regulations could negatively impact our business or the demand for our products and services by customers and other industry related participants, and could result in a negative impact to our operations, or profitability, or our ability to perform projects in any respective regions.\nFederal, state and local governments have a major impact on the framework and economics of the US nuclear power industry. Changes in laws or regulations regarding the operations of current nuclear facilities could have an impact on the demand for our products and services, which would have a negative impact on our operations. These same risks are also associated with foreign nuclear power industries.\nNew regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.\nIn August 2012, the SEC adopted a rule pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for publicly-traded companies that use tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold (collectively, \u201cconflict minerals\u201d) mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their products. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs for due diligence to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes, or sources of supply. Despite our continued due diligence efforts, in the future we may be unable to verify the origin of all conflict minerals used in our component products. As a result, we could potentially face reputational and other challenges with customers that require that all of the components incorporated in our products be certified as conflict-free.\nOur acquisition strategy involves a number of risks.\nWe intend to pursue continued growth through acquiring the assets of target companies that will enable us to (i) expand our product and service offerings and (ii) increase our geographic footprint. We routinely review potential acquisitions. However, we may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we are not able to reach agreement on mutually acceptable terms. Moreover, our acquisition strategy involves certain risks, including:\n\u2022\nrisks and liabilities from our acquisitions that may not be discovered during the preacquisition due diligence process;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the post acquisition integration of operations and systems;\n\u2022\nthe termination of relationships with key personnel and customers of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nthe potential failure to add additional employees to manage the increased volume of business;\n\u2022\nadditional post acquisition challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and legal compliance;\n\u2022\na disruption of our ongoing business or an inability of our ongoing business to receive sufficient management attention; and\n\u2022\na failure to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated or modeled prior to acquisition.\nFuture acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available to us.\nOur business segments are sensitive to economic downturns.\nIf the general level of economic activity deteriorates from current levels, our customers may delay or cancel new projects. If there is a reduction in demand for our products or services, as a result of a downturn in the general economy, there could be a material adverse effect on price levels and the quantity of goods and services purchased, therefore adversely impacting our revenues, consolidated results from operations and cash flows. A number of factors, including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve, could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future and pay for services or equipment. Certain economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of one or more of our key suppliers, which could affect our ability to secure raw materials and components to meet our customers\u2019 demand for our products in the future. Other various factors drive demand for our products and services, including the price of oil, economic forecasts and financial markets. Uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets could impact our customers and could in turn severely impact the demand for corporate infrastructure projects that would result in a reduction in orders for our products and services. All of these factors combined together could materially impact our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and potentially impact the trading price of our common stock.\nInternational events and political issues may adversely affect our Energy and Metal Coatings segments.\nA portion of the revenues from our Energy and Metal Coatings segments are from international markets. The occurrence of any of the risks described below could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition:\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability in the countries we conduct business;\n\u2022\nsocial unrest, acts of war and terrorism, natural disasters, and global outbreaks of contagious diseases;\n\u2022\ninflation;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuation, devaluations and conversion restrictions;\n\u2022\ngovernmental activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments or limit the movement of funds;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions, tariffs and economic embargoes by the United States or other countries; and\n\u2022\ntravel restrictions placed upon personnel, limiting travel to install equipment or perform services for our customers\nFluctuations in the price and supply of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments may adversely affect our operations.\nIn our Metal Coatings segment, zinc and natural gas represent a large portion of our cost of sales. The prices of zinc and natural gas are subject to volatility. We purchase a wide variety of raw materials for our Energy segment to manufacture our products, including copper, aluminum, steel and nickel. Unanticipated increases in raw material requirements or price increases could increase production costs and adversely affect profitability. The following factors, which are beyond our control, affect the price of raw materials and natural gas for our business segments: supply and demand; freight costs and transportation availability; trade duties and taxes; and labor disputes. We seek to maintain operating margins by attempting to increase the price of our products and services in response to increased costs, but may not be successful in passing these price increases through to our customers\nClimate change could impact our business.\nClimate changes could result in an adverse impact on our operations, particularly in hurricane prone or low lying areas near the ocean. At this time, the Company is not able to speculate as to the potential timing or impact from potential global warming and other natural disasters, however the Company believes that it currently has adequate insurance coverage and disaster recovery plans related to any potential natural disasters that might occur at any of the Company\u2019s sites.\nChanges in greenhouse gas regulations could impact our operating results.\nInternational agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. The level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, our activities in the particular jurisdiction, and market conditions.\nThe effect of regulation on our financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, not limited to, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which we would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the impact of legislation or other regulation on our ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of our products and services.\nOur volume of fixed-price contracts for our Energy segment could adversely affect our business.\nWe currently generate, and expect to continue to generate, a significant portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts. We must estimate the costs of completing a particular project to bid for fixed-price contracts. The actual cost of labor and materials, however, may vary from the costs we originally estimated. Depending on the size of a particular project, variations from estimated cost could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal year.\nOur use of over time revenue accounting in the Energy segment could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits.\nAs discussed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, a portion of our revenues is recognized over time. Over time revenue recognition causes us to recognize contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability. Contract losses are recognized in full when determined, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability. Actual collection of contract amounts or change orders could differ from original estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant.\nWe may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our backlog for our Energy segment.\nWe maintain a backlog of work in our Energy segment due to the lead time required to design, procure and manufacture our Energy products or services. Orders included in our backlog are represented by customer purchase orders and contracts, which we believe to be firm. Backlog develops as a result of new business secured, which represents the contractual value of new project commitments received by us during a given period. Backlog consists of orders which have either (1) not been started or (2) are in progress and are not yet complete. In the latter case, the revenue value reported in backlog is the remaining value associated with work that has not yet been completed. From time to time, orders recorded as new business or new backlog are cancelled. In the event cancellation, we are often reimbursed for certain costs and the margin on those costs, but typically have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. In addition to being unable to recover certain direct costs, we may also incur additional costs resulting from underutilized assets if orders are cancelled.\nAdoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations could make it easier for our employees to obtain union representation and our business could be adversely impacted.\nOther than a nominal number of employees at four of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, none of our employees are currently represented by unions. However, our U.S. based employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union. If a large portion of our workforce were to become unionized and the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could increase our operating costs and adversely impact our profitability. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of new regulations, or the enactment of new legislation could have an adverse impact on our business; to the extent it becomes easier for workers to obtain union representation.\nAZZ\u2019s flexibility to operate its business could be impacted by provisions in its debt obligations.\nAZZ\u2019s debt instruments contain covenants which restrict or prohibit certain actions (\u201cnegative covenants\u201d), including, but not limited to, the Company's ability to incur debt, create or suffer to exist liens, capital spending limits, engage in certain merger, acquisition, or divestiture actions, or increase dividends beyond a specific level. AZZ\u2019s debt instruments also contain covenants requiring AZZ to, among other things, maintain specified financial ratios (\u201caffirmative covenants\u201d). Failure to comply with these negative covenants and affirmative covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could restrict the Company\u2019s access to liquidity and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business or prospects. If the Company does not have enough cash to service its debt or fund other liquidity needs, AZZ may be required to take actions such as requesting a waiver from lenders, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of the existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. AZZ cannot assure that any of these remedies can be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nA failure in our operational systems or cyber security attacks on any of our facilities, or those of third parties, may\naffect adversely our financial results.\nOur business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions. If any of our financial, operational, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our operational systems. Due to increased technology advances, we have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our business. We use computer programs to help run our financial and operations sectors, and this may subject our business to increased risks. Any future cyber security attacks that affect our facilities, our customers and any financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, cyber attacks on our customers, suppliers and employee data may result in a financial loss, including potential fines for failure to safeguard data, and may negatively impact our reputation. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer operational system failure. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from Multiemployer Pension Plans.\nWe are a participating employer in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer defined benefit pension plans for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In the event of our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan, we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal. Depending on various factors, a future withdrawal could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, adversely affect investor confidence in our company, the value of our common stock and our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner.\nPursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting and to provide a report of management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of such controls. The Company had a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting as of February 29, 2020 related to the accounting for income taxes. Although we are working to fully remediate this material weakness, there can be no assurance as to when the remediation plan will be fully implemented and executed. Any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that has not been remediated or that may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our consolidated financial statements, restatements of those financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.", "PERMNO": 16126, "SIC": 3640, "TIC": "AZZ"}
