{"cik": "24491", "company": "COOPER TIRE & RUBBER CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSome of the material risk factors related to the Company follow:\nRisks related to the Merger\nThe consideration the Company\u2019s stockholders will receive in the Merger is uncertain because the market price of Goodyear common stock will fluctuate.\nSubject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, upon consummation of the Merger, each share of the Company\u2019s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than dissenting shares, stock options, restricted stock units, performance stock units, treasury shares held by the Company and shares of the Company\u2019s common stock owned directly or indirectly by the Company, Goodyear or Merger Sub) will be converted into the right to receive $41.75 per share in cash and 0.907 shares of Goodyear common stock (as well as cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Goodyear common stock and any dividends or distributions on the Goodyear common stock with a record date on or after the effective time of the Merger). The exchange ratio in the Merger is fixed, and there will be no adjustment to the consideration to be received by the Company\u2019s stockholders in the Merger for changes in the market price of Goodyear common stock or the Company\u2019s common stock prior to the completion of the Merger. The market value of Goodyear common stock may fluctuate prior to the closing of the transaction as a result of a variety of factors, including reactions from the financial markets to the Merger, general market and economic conditions, changes in Goodyear\u2019s business, operations and prospects and regulatory considerations. Such factors are difficult to predict and in many cases may be beyond the Company\u2019s control or Goodyear\u2019s control. The actual value of the consideration to be received by the Company\u2019s stockholders at the completion of the Merger will depend on the market value of the Goodyear common stock at that time. This market value may differ, possibly materially, from the market value of the Company\u2019s shares of common stock at the time the Merger Agreement was entered into or at any other time.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Merger may not be completed.\nThe Merger Agreement contains a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived in order to complete the Merger. Those conditions include, among others:\n\u2022the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Company\u2019s stockholders;\n\u2022the approval to list the shares of Goodyear common stock issuable in connection with the Merger on Nasdaq;\n\u2022the expiration or termination of the antitrust waiting period or the approval of regulatory agencies applicable to the Merger;\n\u2022the absence of any governmental order or law prohibiting the consummation of the Merger;\n\u2022the accuracy of Goodyear\u2019s and the Company\u2019s respective representations and warranties under the Merger Agreement (subject to the materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement);\n\u2022Goodyear\u2019s and the Company\u2019s performance of their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement in all material respects; and\n\u2022the absence of a material adverse effect on the Company or Goodyear (as described in the Merger Agreement).\nThese conditions to the closing of the Merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the Merger may be delayed or may not be completed. In addition, if the Merger is not completed by November 22, 2021 (subject to the Company\u2019s and Goodyear\u2019s ability to extend the date to May 23, 2022, either Goodyear or the Company may choose not to proceed with the Merger. The parties can mutually decide to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time. In addition, Goodyear could determine that it is unwilling or unable to close the Merger.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock and the Company\u2019s debt securities, as well as the Company\u2019s financial results, may be negatively impacted if the Merger is not completed.\nIf the Merger is not completed for any reason, including the failure of the Company\u2019s stockholders to approve the requisite transactions, the Company\u2019s business and financial results may be adversely affected, including as follows:\n\u2022the Company may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on the market price of its common stock and debt securities;\n\u2022the manner in which customers, vendors, business partners and other third parties perceive the Company may be negatively impacted, which in turn could affect the Company\u2019s ability to compete for new business or maintain existing business in the marketplace more broadly;\n\u2022the Company may experience negative reactions from employees and its joint venture partners, which may adversely affect, among other things, availability of TBR tires, productivity, employee turnover and occupational safety; and\n\u2022the Company have and will continue to expend significant time and resources that could otherwise have been spent on its existing businesses and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to the Company, and its ongoing business and financial results may be adversely affected.\nIn addition to the above risks, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Company\u2019s Board of Directors seeks an alternative transaction, the Company\u2019s stockholders cannot be certain that the Company will be able to find a party willing to engage in a transaction on more attractive terms than the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, the Company also may be required to pay Goodyear a termination fee.\nThe Merger Agreement limits the Company\u2019s ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third party from submitting an acquisition proposal to the Company that might result in greater value to the Company\u2019s stockholders than the Merger, or may result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire the Company than it might otherwise have proposed to pay. These provisions include a general prohibition on the Company\u2019s soliciting or, subject to certain exceptions relating to the exercise of fiduciary duties by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, entering into discussions with any third party regarding any acquisition proposal or offer for a competing transaction, and a termination fee that is payable to Goodyear if the Company terminates the Merger Agreement to accept a superior acquisition proposal.\nWhile the Merger is pending, the Company may be exposed to a number of business uncertainties and related adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees, suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on the Company. These uncertainties may impair the Company\u2019s relationships with collectively bargained employees and the Company\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause suppliers, customers, partners and others that deal with the Company to seek to change the Company\u2019s existing business relationships. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts the Company from entering into certain corporate transactions and taking other specified actions without the consent of Goodyear, and generally requires the Company to continue its operations in the ordinary course, until completion of the Merger. These restrictions may prevent the Company from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger.\nThe Merger-related costs may exceed the Company\u2019s expectations.\nThe Company has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including, among others, fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, employee retention costs, severance and benefit costs and filing fees. Many of these costs will be borne by the Company even if the Merger is not completed and could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company may lose management personnel and other employees, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s future business and operations.\nThe Company is dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of its officers and other employees to execute the Company\u2019s business plans. The Company\u2019s success depends in part upon its ability to retain management personnel and other employees. The Company\u2019s current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following the Merger, which may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to attract or retain management and other personnel while the Merger is pending.\nThe Company and its directors may be targets of securities class action and derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Merger from being completed.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies and their directors when companies enter into agreements for transactions similar to those contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and such lawsuits may be brought against the Company and its directors in connection with the Merger Agreement. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s liquidity and financial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Merger, then that injunction may delay or prevent the Merger from being completed, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position and results of operations.\nThe Merger may be less accretive than expected, or may be dilutive, and the combined company may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the proposed Merger.\nThe success of the proposed Merger will depend, in part, on the combined company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the Company\u2019s and Goodyear\u2019s businesses. The anticipated benefits and cost savings of the proposed Merger may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize than expected, may require more non-recurring costs and expenditures to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that the Company and Goodyear do not currently foresee. Some of the assumptions that the companies have made, such as with respect to anticipated operating synergies or the costs associated with realizing such synergies; significant long-term cash flow generation; and the benefits of the combined enterprise, may not be realized. The integration process may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. There could also be potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the Merger that were not discovered in the course of performing due diligence. Any of the foregoing factors could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business, financial position and results of operations.\nRisks related to the Company's Operations\nImpact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or similar public health crises, on the Company's operations, distribution channels, customers and suppliers.\nFrom time to time, the Company may face risks related to public health threats or outbreaks of communicable diseases, such as COVID-19. The Company has global manufacturing facilities, distribution channels, suppliers and customers, and if a disease spreads sufficiently to cause a pandemic (or to cause the fear of a pandemic to rise) or governments regulate or restrict the flow of people, labor or products, the Company's financial condition, operations, suppliers, customers and distribution channels could be severely impacted. Such a pandemic could also have an adverse impact on consumer demand and commodity prices. Any material changes in the Company's production supply or demand for products could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations and liquidity.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted financial markets and international trade, resulted in increased unemployment levels and significantly impacted global supply chains. The tire industry has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, characterized by a decline in tire demand in 2020. . The Company\u2019s results have been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by this economic disruption, including impacting tire unit volumes, sales, income and cash flow. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to continue implementing important strategic initiatives and capital expenditures may be affected as it devotes time and other resources to responding to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to government mandates and health care advisories, the Company altered certain aspects of its operations, including the temporary idling of manufacturing facilities for various lengths of time. A portion of the Company's workforce has had to spend a significant amount of time working remotely, which may increase cybersecurity and data security risks, and disrupt internal controls and procedures.\nFederal, state, local and foreign governments have implemented various mitigation measures, including travel restrictions, border closings, restrictions on public gatherings, shelter-in-place restrictions and limitations on business, and these measures change from time to time. Some of these actions could adversely impact the ability of Company employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, and other business partners to conduct business activities, and could ultimately do so for an indefinite period of time. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In particular, the continued prevalence of COVID-19 and efforts to contain the virus could:\n\u2022continue to impact customers and customer demand for the Company's products;\n\u2022cause disruptions of the Company's workforce or operations;\n\u2022cause the Company to experience an increase in costs and credit risk as a result of the Company\u2019s emergency measures, delayed payments from customers and uncollectable accounts;\n\u2022cause delays and disruptions in the supply chain resulting in disruptions in operations;\n\u2022result in temporary idling of facilities and the resulting costs to resume full operations;\n\u2022result in asset impairments or other charges;\n\u2022negatively impact the Company's liquidity position;\n\u2022limit the Company's access to funds under its existing credit facility and the capital markets;\n\u2022impact availability of qualified personnel; and\n\u2022cause other unpredictable events.\nThe situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid. In late 2020, vaccines for COVID-19 were approved by health agencies in certain countries in which the Company operates (including the U.S., U.K., Canada and Mexico) and began to be administered. However, initial quantities of vaccines are limited and vaccine distributions, controlled by local authorities, are being allocated, generally first to health care and other essential workers and next to those members of individual populations believed most susceptible to severe effects from COVID-19. Full administration of the COVID-19 vaccines is unlikely to occur in most jurisdictions until mid- to late- 2021.For this reason, the Company cannot reasonably estimate with any degree of certainty the future impact COVID-19 may have on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company\u2019s business, operating results, financial condition, or liquidity will depend on future developments, including the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions, government mandated restrictions and regulations, business and workforce disruptions, impact on demand for Company products, and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the disease, including the efficacy of and ability to widely distribute vaccinations.\nThe impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed herein, any of which could have a material effect on the Company. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that the Company is not aware of currently.\nPricing volatility for raw materials or commodities or an inadequate supply of key raw materials could result in increased costs and may significantly affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe pricing volatility for natural rubber, petroleum-based materials and other raw materials contributes to the difficulty in managing the costs of raw materials. Costs for certain raw materials used in the Company\u2019s operations, including natural rubber, chemicals, carbon black, steel reinforcements and synthetic rubber remain highly volatile. Increasing costs for raw material will increase the Company\u2019s production costs and affect its margins if the Company is unable to pass the higher production costs on to its customers in the form of price increases. Even if the Company is able to pass along these higher costs, its profitability may be adversely affected until it is able to do so. Decreasing costs for raw materials could also affect margins if the Company is unable to maintain its pricing structure due to the need to offer price reductions to remain competitive. Further, if the Company is unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner for any reason, including supply chain disruption, its operations could be interrupted or otherwise adversely affected.\nAny interruption in the Company\u2019s skilled workforce, or that of its suppliers or customers, including labor disruptions, could impair its operations and harm its earnings and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations depend on maintaining a skilled workforce, including the use of third party labor outsourcing, and any interruption of its workforce due to shortages of skilled technical, production or professional workers, work disruptions, lost time due to illness, temporary idling of facilities, short-term furloughs, or other events could interrupt the Company\u2019s operations and affect its operating results. Competition for these employees is intense and the Company could experience difficulty in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support its business. Further, a significant number of the Company\u2019s employees are currently represented by unions. If the Company is unable to resolve any labor disputes or if there are work stoppages or other work disruptions at the Company or any of its suppliers or customers, the Company\u2019s business and operating results could suffer.\nIf the Company is unable to attract and retain key personnel, its business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on the continued service of key members of its management. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of its management team could have a material adverse effect on its business. The Company\u2019s future success will also depend on its ability to attract, retain and develop highly skilled personnel, such as engineering, marketing, information technology and senior management professionals. Competition for these employees is intense and the Company could experience difficulty in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support its business. If the Company does not succeed in retaining its current employees and attracting new high-quality employees, its business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s industry is highly competitive, and the Company may not be able to compete effectively with lower-cost producers and larger competitors.\nThe tire industry is a highly competitive, global industry. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors are larger companies with greater financial resources. Intense competitive activity in the replacement tire industry, including consolidation or other cooperation by and among the Company's competitors, has caused, and will continue to cause, pressures on the Company\u2019s business, as well as pressure on certain of the Company's customers, suppliers or distribution network. As the Company increases its presence in the original equipment market, the demand for products by the OEM's will be impacted by automotive vehicle production. The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully will depend in part on its ability to balance capacity with demand, leverage global purchasing of raw materials, make required investments to improve productivity, eliminate redundancies and increase production at low-cost, high-quality supply sources. If the Company is unable to offset continued pressures, its sales, margins, operating results and market share could decline and the impact could become material on the Company\u2019s earnings.\nThe Company has and could in the future incur restructuring charges and other costs as it continues to execute actions in an effort to improve future profitability and competitiveness and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits from these actions.\nThe Company has and may in the future initiate restructuring actions designed to improve future profitability and competitiveness, and enhance the Company\u2019s flexibility, including the outcome of the restructurings and related actions in Europe, the U.S. and at the Company's manufacturing facility in Mexico, after the recent purchase of the remaining noncontrolling interest in the facility, as well as other current and potential future outcomes from the Company's ongoing region by region global footprint assessment. The Company may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from the Mexico purchase and restructuring, or other actions, in full or in part or within the time periods it expects. The Company is also subject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption in connection with these actions. Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from the Company\u2019s actions could have an adverse effect on the business and could result in potential unexpected costs or other impacts. Such restructuring actions and impairments or other charges, including pension obligations, could have a significant negative effect on the Company\u2019s earnings or cash flows in the short-term.\nIf the price of energy sources increases, the Company\u2019s operating expenses could increase significantly or the demand for the Company\u2019s products could be affected.\nThe Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities rely principally on natural gas, as well as electrical power and other energy sources. High demand and limited availability of natural gas and other energy sources can result in significant increases in energy costs increasing the Company\u2019s operating expenses and transportation costs. Higher energy costs would increase the Company\u2019s production costs and adversely affect its margins and results of operations. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate sources of energy, its operations could be interrupted.\nIn addition, fluctuations in the price of gasoline for consumers can affect driving and purchasing habits and impact demand for tires.\nIf assumptions used in developing the Company\u2019s strategic plan are inaccurate or the Company is unable to execute its strategic plan effectively, its profitability and financial position could be negatively impacted.\nThe Company faces both general industry and Company-specific challenges. These include volatile raw material costs, increasing product complexity and pressure from competitors with greater resources or manufacturing in lower-cost regions. To address these challenges and position the Company for future success, the Company continues to execute towards its strategic plan.\nThe Company continually reviews and updates its business plans to achieve its goals and imperatives. There can be no assurance that the Company's strategic business plans will be successful. If the assumptions used in developing the Company\u2019s business plans vary significantly from actual conditions, and the Company is not able to adapt in a timely manner, the Company\u2019s sales, margins and profitability could be harmed. If the Company is unsuccessful in implementing the tactics necessary to execute its business plans, it may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability, which could impair its ability to meet debt and other obligations and could otherwise negatively affect its operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe Company may not be successful in executing and integrating investments and acquisitions into its operations, which could harm its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company routinely evaluates potential investments and acquisitions and may pursue additional investment and acquisition opportunities, some of which could be material to its business. These investments include the formation of the ACTR joint venture in Vietnam, the purchase of the remaining noncontrolling interest in the Company's Mexican manufacturing facility and investment in the Company's Serbian manufacturing facility. The Company cannot provide assurance whether it will be successful in pursuing, integrating, ramping up and operating any investment or acquisition opportunities or what the consequences of any investment or acquisition would be. The Company may encounter various risks in any investment or acquisition, including:\n\u2022the possible inability to integrate an acquired business into its operations;\n\u2022the possible failure to successfully ramp up and operate the business;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022loss of key management personnel;\n\u2022labor disruption, including as a result of the Company's purchase or restructuring activities;\n\u2022unanticipated problems or liabilities, including delays in completion of required capital expenditures and/or construction;\n\u2022potential asset impairment charges, due to inability to meet operating plans; and\n\u2022increased labor and regulatory compliance costs of acquired businesses.\nSome or all of those risks could impair the Company\u2019s results of operations and impact its financial condition. The Company may finance any future investments or acquisitions from internally generated funds, bank borrowings, public offerings or private placements of equity or debt securities, or a combination of the foregoing. Investments and acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time.\nInvestments and acquisitions may also require the Company to increase its borrowings under its bank credit facilities or other debt instruments, or to seek new sources of liquidity. Increased borrowings would correspondingly increase the Company\u2019s financial leverage, and could result in lower credit ratings and increased future borrowing costs. These risks could also reduce the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changes in its industry or in general economic conditions.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s business plans call for growth. If the Company is unable to identify or execute on appropriate opportunities for acquisition, investment or growth, its business could be materially adversely affected.\nThere are risks associated with the Company\u2019s global strategy, which includes using joint ventures and partially-owned subsidiaries.\nThe Company\u2019s strategy includes the use of joint ventures, both as the majority and minority stockholder, and other partially-owned subsidiaries. These entities operate in countries outside of the U.S., are generally less well capitalized than the Company and bear risks similar to the risks of the Company. In addition, there are specific risks applicable to these subsidiaries and these risks, in turn, add potential risks to the Company. Such risks include greater risk of joint venture partners or other investors failing to meet their obligations under related stockholders\u2019 agreements; conflicts with joint venture partners; the possibility of a joint venture partner taking valuable knowledge from the Company; and risk of being denied access to the capital markets, which could lead to resource demands on the Company in order to maintain or advance its strategy. The Company\u2019s outstanding notes and primary credit facility contain cross default provisions in the event of certain defaults by the Company under other agreements with third parties. For further discussion of access to the capital markets, see also related comments under \u201cThe Company has a risk due to volatility of the capital and financial markets.\u201d\nThe Company\u2019s expenditures for pension and other postretirement obligations could be materially higher than it has predicted if its underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect.\nThe Company provides defined benefit and hybrid pension plan coverage to union and non-union U.S. employees and a contributory defined benefit plan in the U.K. The Company\u2019s pension expense and its required contributions to its pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions the Company uses to measure its defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value and the inflation rate. The Company could experience increased pension expense due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of its pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate, changes in its assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets, including changes necessitated by movements in the glide path whereby a target return-seeking allocation is followed based upon a given funded ratio level, updates to mortality tables, changes to participant behaviors, including an increase in the volume of lump-sum distributions out of the plans, and the impact of changes to the Company\u2019s pension strategy. The Company could also experience increased other postretirement expense due to decreases in the discount rate, increases in the health care trend rate and changes in the health care environment.\nIn the event of declines in the market value of the Company\u2019s pension assets or lower discount rates to measure the present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, the Company could experience changes to its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet or significant cash requirements.\nThe realizability of deferred tax assets may affect the Company\u2019s profitability and cash flows.\nThe Company has significant net deferred tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and determines at each reporting period whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary based upon the expected realizability of such deferred tax assets. In the U.S., the Company has recorded deferred tax assets, the largest of which relate to product liability, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, partially offset by deferred tax liabilities, the most significant of which relates to accelerated depreciation. The Company\u2019s non-U.S. deferred tax assets relate to pension, accrued expenses and net operating losses, and are partially offset by deferred tax liabilities related to accelerated depreciation. Based upon the Company\u2019s assessment of the realizability of its net deferred tax assets, the Company maintains valuation allowances in the U.K. and China, as well as a small valuation allowance for the portion of its U.S. deferred tax assets primarily associated with a loss carryforward. In addition, the Company has recorded valuation allowances for deferred tax assets primarily associated with other non-U.S. net operating losses.\nThe Company\u2019s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets is based in part on certain assumptions regarding future profitability, and potentially adverse business conditions could have a negative impact on the future realizability of the deferred tax assets and therefore impact the Company\u2019s future operating results or financial position.\nRisks related to Information Technology, Research & Development and Intellectual Property\nA disruption in, or failure of, the Company\u2019s information technology systems, including those related to cybersecurity, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business operations and financial performance.\nThe Company relies on the accuracy, capacity and security of its information technology systems across all of its major business functions, including its research and development, manufacturing, sales, financial and administrative functions. While the Company maintains some of its critical information technology systems, it is also dependent on third parties to provide important information technology services relating to, among other things, human resources, electronic communications and certain finance functions. Additionally, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of its customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of the Company\u2019s customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks.\nIn addition, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which came into effect in May 2018, creates a range of new compliance obligations for companies that process personal data of European Union residents, and increases financial penalties for non-compliance. As a company that processes personal data of European Union residents, the Company bears the costs of compliance with the GDPR and is subject to the potential for fines and penalties in the event of a breach of the GDPR.\nAside from the European Union, other jurisdictions have enacted, or are considering, regulations regarding data privacy. The California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\"), which became effective in January 2020, and others that may be passed, introduce requirements with respect to personal information, and non-compliance with CCPA may result in liability through private actions and enforcement. Failure to comply with these current and future laws could result in significant penalties and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and results of operations.\nDespite the security measures that the Company has implemented, including those related to cybersecurity, its systems could be breached or damaged by computer viruses, natural or man-made incidents or disasters or unauthorized physical or electronic access. Additionally, digital technologies may become more vulnerable and experience a higher rate of rapidly evolving cyberattacks in the environment of remote connectivity, which will continue to be an important aspect of the Company's operations. Furthermore, the Company may have little or no oversight with respect to security measures employed by third-party service providers, which may ultimately prove to be ineffective at countering threats. A system failure, accident or security breach could result in business disruption, theft of intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information and unauthorized access to personnel information. To the extent that any system failure, accident or security breach results in disruptions to the Company's operations or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, the Company's data or confidential information, the Company\u2019s reputation, business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the Company may be required to incur significant costs to protect against and, if required, remediate the damage caused by such disruptions or system failures in the future.\nIf the Company fails to develop technologies, processes or products needed to keep up with rapidly evolving distribution channels and to support consumer and customer demand or, changes in consumer or customer behavior, it may lose significant market share or be unable to recover associated costs.\nThe Company\u2019s tire sales, margins and profitability may be significantly impacted if it does not develop or have available technologies, processes, including distribution methods, or products that competitors may be developing and consumers or dealers or distributors are demanding. This includes, but is not limited to, changes in the design of and materials used to manufacture tires, changes in the types of tires consumers prefer and changes in the vehicles consumers are purchasing. Additionally, the Company is also impacted by changes in consumer brand perceptions and the way consumers buy tires and failure to effectively compete in various sales and marketing channels, including digital channels and mass merchandising outlets, could result in lost sales and negative impacts on the Company's earnings.\nTechnologies or processes may also be developed by competitors that better distribute tires to consumers, including through wholly-owned distributors, which could affect the Company\u2019s customers, as well as impact the Company's implementation of its strategic plan.\nAn increase in consumer preference for car- and ride-sharing services, as opposed to automobile ownership, or other changes in consumer driving practices, including reduced driving caused by increases in remote working arrangements or a rise in consumer e-commerce activity levels, may result in a long term reduction in the number of vehicles per capita or in miles driven. Additionally, refreshing existing products and developing new products and technologies requires significant investment and capital expenditures, is technologically challenging and requires extensive testing and accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. If the Company fails to develop new products that are appealing to the Company's customers and consumers, or fails to develop products on time and within budgeted amounts, the Company may be unable to recover its product development and testing costs. If the Company cannot successfully use new production or equipment methodologies it invests in, it may also not be able to recover those costs.\nThe Company may fail to successfully develop or implement information technologies or related systems, resulting in a significant competitive disadvantage.\nCompeting in the highly competitive tire industry can be impacted by the successful development of information technology. If the Company fails to successfully develop or implement information technology systems, it may be at a disadvantage to its competitors resulting in lost sales and negative impacts on the Company\u2019s earnings.\nThe Company has implemented Enterprise Resource Planning systems in the United States and other locations. The Company has begun to invest in, and will also continue to evaluate. available options for integrating information technology solutions outside of the United States, which will require significant amounts of capital and human resources to deploy. These requirements may exceed Company projections. Throughout integration of the systems, there are also risks created to the Company\u2019s ability to successfully and efficiently operate.\nThe Company may not be able to protect its intellectual property rights adequately.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in part upon its ability to use and protect its proprietary technology and other intellectual property, which generally covers various aspects in the design and manufacture of its products and processes. The Company owns and uses tradenames and trademarks worldwide. The Company relies upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect its intellectual property rights. The steps the Company takes in this regard may not be adequate to protect its intellectual property or to prevent or deter challenges or infringement or other violations of its intellectual property, and the Company may not be able to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce its intellectual property rights.\nIn addition, the laws of some countries may not protect and enforce the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Further, while the Company believes it has rights to use all intellectual property in the Company\u2019s use, if the Company is found to infringe on the rights of others it could be adversely impacted.\nRisks related to Litigation, Laws and Regulations\nThe Company\u2019s results could be impacted by changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or other governments on imported tires, raw materials or equipment used in tire manufacturing.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to competitively source and sell tires can be significantly impacted by changes in tariffs, changes or repeals of trade agreements, including the USMCA, as well as the U.K.'s exit from the European Union, or certain other international trade agreements, or other trade restrictions or retaliatory actions imposed by various governments. Other effects, including impacts on the price of tires, responsive actions from governments and the opportunity for competitors to establish a presence in markets where the Company participates, could also have significant impacts on the Company\u2019s results.\nAntidumping and countervailing duty investigations into certain passenger car and light truck tires imported from the PRC into the United States were initiated on July 14, 2014. The determinations announced in both investigations were affirmative and resulted in the imposition of significant additional duties from each. The rates are subject to review annually and a material change in the new rates could have a significant impact on the Company's results.\nAntidumping and countervailing duty investigations into certain truck and bus tires imported from the PRC into the U.S. were initiated on January 29, 2016. On February 22, 2017, the International Trade Commission (\"ITC\") made a final determination that the U.S. market had not suffered material injury because of imports of truck and bus tires from the PRC. However, on November 1, 2018, the Court of International Trade (\"CIT\") remanded the case back to the ITC for reconsideration. On January 30, 2019, the ITC reversed its earlier decision and made an affirmative determination of material injury. On February 15, 2019, the determination was published in the Federal Register and significant duties were imposed on Chinese truck and bus tire imports. The ITC\u2019s re-determination, along with comments from the parties regarding the re-determination were filed with the CIT. The CIT affirmed the ITC re-determination on February 18, 2020.\nPursuant to Section 301: China\u2019s Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation, passenger, light truck and truck and bus tires, raw materials and tire-manufacturing equipment from the PRC imported into the U.S. became subject to additional 10 percent duties effective September 24, 2018. These increased to 25 percent effective May 10, 2019. Future changes to duty percentages, if any, are unknown at this time. Retaliatory duties on U.S. products have been implemented by China in response to these additional duties.\nThe imposition of additional duties or other trade restrictions in the U.S. or elsewhere on raw materials or tire-manufacturing equipment used by the Company or on certain tires imported from the PRC or other countries will result in higher costs and potentially lower margins, or in the case of finished goods, in those tires being diverted to other regions of the world, such as Europe, Latin America or elsewhere in Asia, which could materially harm the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by legal actions, including product liability claims which, if successful, could have a negative impact on its financial position, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations expose it to legal actions, including potential liability for personal injury or death as an alleged result of the failure of or conditions in the products that it designs, manufactures and sells. Specifically, the Company is a party to a number of product liability cases in which individuals involved in motor vehicle accidents seek damages resulting from allegedly defective tires that it manufactured. Product liability claims and lawsuits, including possible class action, may result in material losses in the future and cause the Company to incur significant litigation defense costs. The Company is largely self-insured against these claims. These claims and related reserves could have a significant effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, cash flows and results of operations.\nPeriodically, the Company is also subject to audits, litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal proceedings relating to its business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation, commercial disputes or other legal proceedings, the Company cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome, including the outcome of any related appeals. An unfavorable outcome could materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nCompliance with legal and regulatory initiatives could increase the cost of operating the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. Compliance with those laws now in effect, or that may be enacted, could require significant capital expenditures, increase the Company\u2019s production costs and affect its earnings and results of operations. Periodic changes as the result of elections in the U.S. and worldwide make it difficult to predict the legislative and regulatory changes that may occur.\nSeveral countries have or may implement labeling requirements for tires. This legislation could cause the Company\u2019s products to be at a disadvantage in the marketplace resulting in a loss of market share or could otherwise impact the Company\u2019s ability to distribute and sell its tires.\nIn addition, while the Company believes that its tires are free from design and manufacturing defects and comply with all applicable regulations and standards, it is possible that recalls of or other quality issues with the Company\u2019s tires could occur in the future. A recall or other quality issue could harm the Company\u2019s reputation, operating results and financial position.\nThe Company is also subject to legislation governing labor, environmental, privacy and data protection, occupational safety and health both in the U.S. and other countries. The related legislation can change over time making it more expensive for the Company to produce its products.\nThe Company could also, despite its best efforts to comply with these laws and regulations, be found liable and be subject to additional costs because of these laws and regulations.\nCompliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales and use, payroll, franchise, withholding and property taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations could result in increased expenditures by the Company for tax liabilities in the future and could materially and adversely impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and local tax authorities in the U.S. and tax authorities outside the U.S. Based upon the outcome of tax examinations, judicial proceedings, or expiration of statutes of limitations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these unrecognized tax benefits, including those related to tax planning strategies regarding the Company's structure, may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities. Such factors could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy income tax obligations.\nThe impact of proposed new accounting standards may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board is considering or has issued for future adoption several projects which may result in the modification of accounting standards affecting the Company. Any such changes could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nThe Company is facing risks relating to healthcare legislation.\nThe Company is facing risks emanating from legislation in the U.S., including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the related Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act, which are collectively referred to as healthcare legislation. The future of this major legislation and any potential replacement is not clear and may be impacted by the results of recent and future elections in the U.S. The ultimate cost and the potentially adverse impact to the Company and its employees cannot be quantified at this time.\nEnvironmental issues, including climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address environmental issues, may negatively affect the Company's business and operations and cause it to incur significant costs.\nThe Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, and the Company expects that additional requirements with respect to environmental matters will be imposed on it in the future.\nThere is also growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that issues related to such climate change have a negative effect on the Company's business, it may be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain raw materials, including natural rubber. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may also disrupt the productivity of the Company's facilities or the operation of its supply chain.\nIn addition, the Company has contractual indemnification obligations for environmental remediation costs and liabilities that may arise relating to certain divested operations. Material future expenditures may be necessary if compliance standards change, if material unknown conditions that require remediation are discovered, or if required remediation of known conditions becomes more extensive than expected. If the Company fails to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, it could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production, which could harm its business or results of operations. Environmental laws could also restrict the Company\u2019s ability to expand its facilities or could require it to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with its manufacturing processes.\nGeneral risk factors\nThe Company is facing heightened risks due to the uncertain business environment.\nCurrent global and regional economic conditions have affected demand for the Company\u2019s products, create volatility in raw material costs and affect the availability and cost of credit. These conditions also affect the Company\u2019s customers and suppliers as well as the ultimate consumer.\nDeterioration in the global macroeconomic environment or in specific regions, including availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, public health emergencies, social unrest, political upheavals or other factors, could impact the Company, its customers or its suppliers and, depending upon the severity and duration of these factors, the Company\u2019s profitability and liquidity position could be negatively impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s competitors may also change their actions as a result of changes to the business environment, which could result in increased price competition and discounts, resulting in lower margins or reduced sales volumes for the business.\nThe financial distress of one or more of the Company's major customers as a result of the current economic environment, or other factors, could impact the timeliness of customer payments and, ultimately, the collectability of accounts receivable, which could harm the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, the bankruptcy, restructuring, financial condition, consolidation or other cooperation of one or more of the Company\u2019s major suppliers, as well as the strategic actions of competitors, could result in a reduction in purchases of the Company\u2019s products or a supply disruption to its facilities, which could harm the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe Company conducts its manufacturing, sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and is subject to risks associated with doing business outside the U.S.\nThe Company has affiliate, subsidiary and joint venture operations worldwide, including in the U.S., Europe, Mexico, the PRC and Vietnam. The Company has a wholly-owned manufacturing entity, Cooper Kunshan Tire, and is the majority owner of GRT, both in the PRC. The Company also has COOCSA, a wholly-owned manufacturing entity in Mexico, after purchasing the remaining noncontrolling interest on January 24, 2020, and has established operations in Serbia and the U.K. Additionally, Cooper Vietnam recently formed a joint venture with Sailun Vietnam, which began commercially producing TBR tires in 2020. There are a number of risks in doing business abroad, including political and economic uncertainty, social unrest, sudden changes in laws and regulations, including those enacted in response to pandemics, ability to enforce existing or future contracts, shortages of trained labor and the uncertainties associated with entering into joint ventures or similar arrangements in foreign countries. These risks may impact the Company\u2019s ability to expand its operations in different regions and otherwise achieve its objectives relating to its foreign operations, including utilizing these locations as suppliers to other markets. In addition, compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, import and export limitations and exchange controls is complex and expensive. For example, the Company could be adversely affected by violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws as well as export controls and economic sanction laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and, in some cases, other persons, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining another improper benefit. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against the Company, its officers or its employees, prohibitions on the conduct of the Company\u2019s business and on its ability to offer products and services in one or more countries, and could also harm the Company\u2019s reputation, business and results of operations. The Company\u2019s foreign operations also subject it to the risks of international terrorism and hostilities and to foreign currency risks, including exchange rate fluctuations and limits on the repatriation of funds.

On January 23, 2020, the Withdrawal Act, after clearing all stages in the U.K. Parliament, received royal assent from the Queen. On December 24, 2020, the U.K. and the European Union announced an agreement on the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (\"EU-UK Agreement\"). The trade deal was formally approved by the U.K. House of Commons on December 30, 2020 and is expected to be formally approved by the European Union legislature in March 2021. While the EU-UK Agreement moves to remove uncertainty and a significant amount of financial risk associated with the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union, the Company is still assessing the agreement details and the related impact on the Company's U.K business and other operations. The new trading relationship between the U.K and the European Union will result in increased costs of goods imported into the U.K. from the European Union and exported from the U.K. into the European Union. The movement of goods between the U.K. and the European Union will continue to be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks, leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure. Also, there will be additional costs related to goods that are deemed to originate outside of the U.K. or European Union, as well as Serbia, and for which the originating country has no trade agreement with the U.K.\nThese changes to the trading relationship between the U.K and European Union would likely result in increased cost of goods imported into and exported from the U.K. and may decrease the profitability of the Company's U.K. and other operations. Additional currency volatility could drive a weaker British pound, which increases the cost of goods imported into the U.K. operations and may decrease the profitability of the U.K. operations. A weaker British pound versus the U.S. dollar also causes local currency results of U.K. operations to be translated into fewer U.S. dollars during a reporting period. With a range of outcomes still possible, the impact from Brexit remains uncertain and will depend, in part, on the final outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations.\nThe Company has a risk due to volatility of the capital and financial markets.\nThe Company periodically requires access to the capital and financial markets as a significant source of liquidity for maturing debt payments or working capital needs or investments in the business that it cannot satisfy by cash on hand or operating cash flows. Substantial volatility in world capital markets and the banking industry may make it difficult for the Company to access credit markets and to obtain financing or refinancing, as the case may be, on satisfactory terms or at all. In addition, various additional factors, including a deterioration of the Company\u2019s credit ratings or its business or financial condition, could further impair its access to the capital markets and bank financings. Additionally, any inability to access the capital markets or bank financings, could require the Company to defer critical capital expenditures, reduce or not pay dividends, reduce spending in areas of strategic importance, suspend stock repurchases, sell important assets or, in extreme cases, seek protection from creditors. See also related comments under \u201cThere are risks associated with the Company\u2019s global strategy, which includes using joint ventures and partially-owned subsidiaries.\u201d\nThe Company\u2019s operations in Asia have been or will be financed in part using multiple loans from several lenders to finance working capital needs. These loans are generally for terms of one year or less. Therefore, debt maturities occur frequently and access to the capital markets and bank financings is crucial to the Company\u2019s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to support its operations in Asia.\nLIBOR reform, increases in interest rates or changes in credit ratings may negatively impact the Company.\nCertain of the Company's variable rate debt, including its Credit Facility, currently use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but could result in an increase in the cost of variable rate debt. The interest rates on the Company's term loans and revolving credit facilities can vary based on the Company's credit ratings. The Company's policy is to manage interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements. Interest rate swaps are also used to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt. The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to enhance its ability to manage risk, including interest rate exposures that exist as part of ongoing business operations. The Company does not enter into contracts for trading purposes, nor is it a party to any leveraged derivative instruments. The use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines. However, the Company's use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate exposure to changes in interest rates. Therefore, the Company cannot provide assurance that future credit rating or interest rate changes will not have a material negative impact on its business, financial position or operating results.\nA failure in the Company's internal financial controls could adversely affect the Company's business operations and financial performance.\nThe Company's operations are highly dependent on an ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, across numerous locations and currencies. These transactions must adhere to the Company's internal financial control structure, as well as legal and regulatory standards. Compliance with these legal and reporting requirements can be challenging, including in the current environment of remote connectivity, and the Company could be subject to regulatory fines and penalties for failing to follow these rules or to report timely, accurate and complete information in accordance with such rules. As such requirements expand, compliance with these rules and regulations has become more challenging. As the Company's customer base and geographical reach expands, the volume, speed, frequency and complexity of transactions, especially electronic transactions, increases. Developing and maintaining the Company's internal financial controls becomes more challenging, and the risk of system or human error in connection with such transactions increases. The Company must continuously monitor these internal financial controls to support the Company's operations and respond to changes in regulations and markets. A failure in such internal financial controls could harm the Company\u2019s reputation, operating results and financial position.\nThe Company has been and may continue to be impacted by currency fluctuations, which may reduce reported results for the Company\u2019s international operations and otherwise adversely affect the business.\nBecause the Company conducts transactions in various non-U.S. currencies, including the Euro, Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Swiss franc, Swedish krona, Norwegian krone, Mexican peso, Columbian peso, Chinese yuan, Serbian dinar and Brazilian real, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may impact the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, despite currency hedging actions by the Company. The Company\u2019s operating results are subject to the effects of fluctuations in the value of these currencies and fluctuations in the related currency exchange rates. As a result, the Company\u2019s sales have historically been affected by, and may continue to be affected by, these fluctuations. Exchange rate movements between currencies in which the Company sells its products have been affected by and may continue to result in exchange losses that could materially affect results. During times of strength of the U.S. dollar, the reported revenues of the Company\u2019s international operations will be reduced because local currencies will translate into fewer dollars. In addition, a strong U.S. dollar may increase the competitiveness of competitors based outside of the United States. As a result, continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A weak U.S. dollar could increase the cost of goods imported into the Company's U.S. operations and other goods imported in U.S. dollars at other locations and may decrease the profitability of the Company's operations. As a result, continued weakening of the U.S. dollar may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 27430, "SIC": 3011, "TIC": "CTB"}
