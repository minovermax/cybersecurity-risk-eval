{"cik": "1091596", "company": "Nuo Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-04-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in the Company involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock, you should consider the risks described below in addition to the cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information in this Annual Report and in our other filings with the SEC, including subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. The risks described below may not be the only risks the Company faces. Additional risks not yet known or currently believed to be immaterial may also impair our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer and our common stock could be adversely impacted, resulting in a loss of part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position\nOur Revenue Base Is Limited to a Single Product Seeking Market Adoption, We Need Substantial Additional Financing and Our Ability to Effect Such Financing Successfully Could Be Limited\nOur current revenue base is limited to our Aurix product, and our Aurix revenue has been minimal. Our ongoing product revenues have continued to decline significantly since 2016.\nWe have a history of losses and are not currently profitable. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred a net loss from operations of approximately $90,000. Even if we succeed in raising substantial additional funds, we expect to incur losses and negative operating cash flows in the future. We may never generate sufficient revenues to achieve and maintain profitability.\nHistorically, we have financed our operations through a combination of the sale of debt, equity and equity-linked securities, licensing, royalty, and product revenues. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenues to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we need to finance future cash needs. It is substantially uncertain whether we will be able to obtain such financing on satisfactory terms or at all.\nIf adequate capital cannot be obtained on a timely basis and on satisfactory terms, it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plan, and our revenues and operations and the value of our common stock would be materially and negatively impacted, and we may be forced to curtail or cease our operations.\nWe Have a Limited Operating History and Limited Operating Experience\nWe have only recently began re-implementing our commercialization strategy for Aurix. Thus, we have a very limited operating history. Continued operating losses, together with the risks associated with our ability to gain new customers for Aurix, may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. We may also be forced to respond to unforeseen difficulties, such as decreased demand for our products and services, downward pricing trends, regulatory requirements and unanticipated market pressures.\nOur Financial Position Creates Doubt as to Whether We Will Continue as a Going Concern\nThe Company did not generate any revenues in 2021 or 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company had a net loss of approximately $0.1 million, $0.1 million, and $1.2 million, respectively. There can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain funding from additional financing through private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing necessary to support our working capital requirements. It is uncertain whether we will be able to obtain such financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Our continuing losses and limited cash resources raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and we need to raise substantial additional funds in order to continue to conduct our business. If we are unable to secure sufficient capital to fund our operating activities, we may be forced to delay the completion of, or significantly reduce the scope of, our current business plan, delay the pursuit of commercial insurance reimbursement for our wound treatment technologies, and postpone the hiring of new personnel.\nWe Anticipate Issuing Additional Equity or Debt Securities Which Will Likely Dilute and May Materially and Adversely Affect the Price of Our Common Stock\nAdditional issuance of our common stock or other equity or convertible debt securities will likely dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales may occur, could negatively affect the market price of our common stock. We have used, and will likely continue to use, our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock to fund working capital needs or to acquire technology, product rights or businesses, or for other purposes. If additional equity and/or equity-linked securities are issued, particularly during times when our common stock is trading at relatively low-price levels, the price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe May Not Be Able to Timely and Accurately Report Our Financial Results or Prevent Fraud If We Are Unable to Maintain Effective Disclosure and Internal Controls\nEffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports in a timely manner. Our management concluded there was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of the periods covered by this Form 10-K. Although we have taken steps to remediate such weakness, the material weakness cannot be considered remediated until the controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management concludes that our internal controls are operating effectively. While we believe that our remediation efforts will resolve the identified material weakness, there is No assurance that such efforts will be sufficient or that additional actions will not be necessary, which may undermine our ability to provide timely, accurate and reliable reports on our financial and operating results. Further, if we remediate our current material weakness but identify new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the value of our common stock may be negatively affected. As a result of such failures, we could also become subject to investigations by the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, and become subject to litigation from investors and stockholders, which could harm our reputation, financial condition or divert financial and management resources from our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Regulatory Approval of Our Product\nThe Success of Aurix Is Dependent on Acceptance by the Medical Community\nThe commercial success of our product will depend upon the medical community and patients accepting the therapies as safe and effective. It will also depend on our success introducing the Aurix product within the broad chronic wound market and encouraging provider evaluation and adoption of Aurix in the context of pre-existing wound treatment clinical practice.\nFurthermore, the willingness of the medical community to accept or evaluate our products and processes may be impacted by the medical community\u2019s acceptance of the quality of the clinical information that was collected and published as a result of the CED process. If the medical community and patients do not ultimately accept the therapies as safe and effective, or we are unable to raise awareness of our products and processes, our ability to sell our product may be materially and adversely affected, and the results of our operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Successful Commercialization of the Aurix System Will Depend on Obtaining Reimbursement from Third-Party Payors\nIn the U.S., the market for any pharmaceutical or biologic product is affected by the availability of reimbursement from third party payors, such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit management companies. If we cannot demonstrate favorable outcomes or a cost-benefit relationship, we may have difficulty obtaining adequate coverage or reimbursement for our products from these payors. Third-party payors may also deny coverage for our product if they determine that the product is experimental, unnecessary, or inappropriate. Coverage and reimbursement are often determining factors in predicting a product\u2019s success, with some physicians and patients strongly favoring only those products for which they will be reimbursed.\nThe Aurix System is marketed to healthcare providers. Some of these providers, in turn, seek reimbursement from third-party payors such as Medicare, Medicaid, and other private insurers. While we have established Medicare coverage of Aurix through the NCD reconsideration, we may not be successful with our complete reimbursement strategy, including, without limitation, obtaining any additional regulatory approvals.\nShould we seek to expand our commercialization internationally, we would be subject to international regulations, where the pricing of prescription pharmaceutical products and services and the level of government reimbursement may be subject to governmental control. In some countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to twelve months or longer after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct one or more clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of our product or product candidates to other available therapies. Conducting one or more of these clinical trials would be expensive and result in delays in commercialization of our current and future products.\nManaging and reducing healthcare costs has become a major priority of federal and state governments in the U.S. As a result of healthcare reform efforts, we might become subject to future regulations or other cost-control initiatives that materially restrict the price we can receive for our current and future products. Third-party payors may also limit access and reimbursement for newly approved healthcare products generally or limit the indications for which they will reimburse providers or suppliers who use any products that we may develop. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price for any products that we may develop, which would result in lower product revenues to us.\nA Disruption in Healthcare Provider Networks Could Have an Adverse Effect on Operations and Profitability\nOur operations and future profitability are dependent, in large part, upon the ability to contract with healthcare providers on favorable terms. In any particular service area, healthcare providers could refuse to contract with us or take other actions that could result in higher healthcare costs or create difficulties in meeting our regulatory requirements. In some service areas, certain healthcare providers may have a significant market presence. If healthcare providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate unfavorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market services or to be profitable in those service areas could be adversely affected. Provider networks could also be disrupted by the financial insolvency of a large healthcare provider group. Any disruption in provider networks could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLiquidity Problems or Bankruptcy of our Key Customers or Collaborators Could Have a Significant Adverse Effect on our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur sales to customers are typically made on credit without collateral. There is a risk that key customers will not pay, or that payment may be delayed, because of bankruptcy, contraction of credit availability to such customers, weak sales, or other factors beyond our control, which could increase our exposure to losses from bad debts. In addition, if our key customers were to cease doing business as a result of bankruptcy or significantly reduce their orders from us, it could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, if our collaborators face liquidity problems or file for bankruptcy, they may choose to divert resources away from their continued cooperation and engagement with us or otherwise choose or be forced to reduce operations, which could also have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nWe May Be Unable to Attract a Strategic Partner for the Further Development of Potential Future Product Candidates\nEven if positive clinical data is eventually achieved in any future clinical trials, we may not be able to enter into strategic partnerships, licensing, or other similar arrangements that we may consider necessary or appropriate to commercialize product candidates successfully, or even have the resources necessary to seek such arrangements. Furthermore, even if such a strategic relationship regarding any of our current and future products or product candidates is reached, development milestones, clinical data, or other such benchmarks may not be achieved. Therefore, our products and product candidates may never proceed toward commercialization or drive cash infusions for us, and we may ultimately not be able to monetize the patents, existing clinical data, and other intellectual property.\nOur Efforts to Secure Commercial Partners May Not Be Successful\nFrom time to time, we may engage in discussions with larger companies regarding potential strategic partnerships involving the broad commercialization of Aurix. The resources and expertise of such a partner would greatly facilitate the capture of market share within the wound care market but would require that the economic benefits of such a broad penetration would be shared with said partner. We may not be successful in securing such a partner. Furthermore, even if a partner is secured, the partnership may not attain the market penetration contemplated, and the profits ultimately realized by us, if any, may not be sufficient to allow us to execute our business strategy.\nWe May Use Third-Party Collaborators and Service Providers to Help Us Support, Develop or Commercialize Our Product Candidates, and Our Ability to Commercialize Such Candidates May Be Impaired or Delayed if such Collaborations or Engagements Are Unsuccessful\nWe may in the future selectively pursue strategic collaborations or engagements for, among other purposes, development, data collection, analysis, and/or commercialization of our product candidates, domestically or otherwise. There can be no assurance as to our ability to utilize the data from such engagements to their potential. Nor can there be any assurance, in general, that we will be able to identify future suitable collaborators or negotiate collaboration agreements on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. In any current or future third-party collaborations, we are and would be dependent upon the success of the collaborators in performing their responsibilities and their continued cooperation and engagement. For a variety of reasons outside of our control, our collaborators or third-party providers may not cooperate with us or perform their obligations under our agreements with them. We cannot control the amount and timing of our collaborators\u2019 resources that will be devoted to performing their responsibilities under our agreements with them. Our collaborators may choose to pursue alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. The development and commercialization of our product candidates will be delayed if collaborators fail to conduct their responsibilities in a timely manner or in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or if they breach or terminate their collaboration agreements with us. Disputes with our collaborators could also result in product development delays, decreased revenues and litigation expenses.\nOur Limited Number of Staff May Affect our Ability to Conduct our Operations and Other Functions Effectively\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled management, scientific and sales personnel. As part of our prior cost containment efforts, we reduced staff significantly, from 15 full-time employees at December 31, 2017 to 7 full-time employees as of December 31, 2018 to 1 part-time employee as of December 31, 2021. Upon the anticipated re-introduction of the Aurix product to the commercial marketplace by May 2022, we expect to have only eight employees.\nOur ability to maintain and provide services to our customers and our ability to provide the necessary support as part of any collaborations depends upon our ability to hire and retain business development and scientific and technical personnel with the skills necessary to keep pace with continuing changes in regenerative biological therapy technologies. Our current liquidity situation makes it unlikely that we will be able to hire additional personnel in the immediate future. Even assuming that we can resolve our immediate liquidity concerns, competition for such personnel is intense; we compete with pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare companies with greater access to resources. Our inability to hire qualified personnel may lead to higher recruiting, relocation and compensation costs for such personnel. These increased costs may make hiring new key personnel impractical.\nWe Are Substantially Dependent Upon Our Executive Officers\nOur success substantially depends on the continued service of key management, particular David E. Jorden, our Chief Executive and Financial Officer. We currently do not have an employment agreement with, or maintain key person insurance on, Mr. Jorden. The loss of Mr. Jorden, or other key employees or executive officers, could adversely impact our ability to continue operations unless and until a replacement is identified.\nWe Rely on a Single Supplier for the Reagent Used for Aurix and an Interruption in Our Supply Chain Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business\nA reagent used for our Aurix product, bovine thrombin (Thrombin JMI), is available exclusively through Pfizer. Pfizer may unilaterally raise the prices for the reagent. If a temporary or permanent interruption in the supply of the reagent were to occur, or the manufacturing costs charged by Pfizer exceed what we can reasonably afford, it would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe Could Be Affected by Malpractice or Product Liability Claims\nProviding medical care entails an inherent risk of professional malpractice and other claims. We do not control or direct the practice of medicine by physicians or health care providers who use our product and do not assume responsibility for compliance with regulatory and other requirements directly applicable to physicians. There is no assurance that claims, suits, or complaints relating to the use of our products, and treatment administered by physicians, will not be asserted against us in the future. The production, marketing and sale, and use of our product entails risks that product liability claims will be asserted against us. These risks cannot be eliminated, and we could be held liable for any damages that result from adverse reactions or infectious disease transmission. Such liability could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. We currently maintain professional and product liability insurance coverage, but the coverage limits of this insurance may not be adequate to protect against all potential claims. We may not be able to obtain or maintain professional and product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities.\nOur Product Has Existing Competition in the Marketplace and We May Not Be Able to Compete Effectively.\nIn the market for biotechnology products, we face competition from pharmaceutical companies, biopharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, and other competitors. The chronic wound market has many therapies that compete with Aurix that have established habitual use patterns and provider contracts to encourage standardized use. Furthermore, other companies have developed or are developing products that could be in direct future competition with our current product line. Biotechnology development projects are characterized by intense competition. Thus, we may not be the first to the market with any newly developed products and we may not successfully be able to market these products. If we are not able to participate and compete in the regenerative biological therapy market, our financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to compete effectively against such companies in the future. Many of these companies have substantially greater capital resources, larger marketing staffs and more experience in commercializing products than we do. Recently developed technologies, or technologies that may be developed in the future, may be the basis for developments that will compete with our current and future products.\nRisks Related to Government Regulations\nOur Product Is Subject to Governmental Regulation\nOur success is also impacted by factors outside of our control. Our current technology and products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S., both federal and state, and in foreign countries by various regulatory agencies. Specifically, our product is subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and state regulatory agencies. The FDA regulates drugs, medical devices, and biologics that move in interstate commerce and requires that such products receive clearance or pre-marketing approval based on evidence of safety and efficacy. The regulations of government health ministries in foreign countries are analogous to those of the FDA in both application and scope. In addition, any change in current regulatory interpretations by, or positions of, state regulatory officials where our product is used could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our product in those states. The FDA will require us to obtain clearance or approval of new or modified devices when used for treating specific wounds or marketed with specific wound-healing claims, or for other products under development.\nWe believe all our current product for sale is legally marketed. As we expand and offer and/or develop additional products in the U.S. and in foreign countries, clearance or approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities prior to introduction of any such products into the market may be required. We provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain all necessary approvals from the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries for these products. Failure to obtain the required approvals would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nCompliance with FDA and other governmental requirements imposes significant costs and expenses. Further, our failure to comply with these requirements could result in sanctions, limitations on promotional or other business activities, or other adverse effects on our business. Further, recent efforts to control healthcare costs could negatively affect demand for our current and future products and services.\nWe Must Comply With the Physician Payment Sunshine Act\nWe are required to comply with the United States Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologicals and medical supplies that participate in U.S. federal healthcare programs to report certain payments and items of value given to physicians and teaching hospitals. Manufacturers are required to report this information annually to CMS. The period between August 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013 was the first reporting period for which manufacturers were required to report aggregate payment data to CMS by March 31, 2014. Manufacturers are required to report aggregate payment data to CMS by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. We cannot assure you that we will collect and report all data timely and accurately. If we fail to accurately and timely report this information, we could suffer severe penalties.\nAny applicable manufacturer that fails to timely, accurately, or completely report the information required in accordance with the rules of the Sunshine Act is subject to a civil monetary penalty of not less than $1,000, but not more than $10,000, for each payment or other transfer of value or ownership or investment interest not reported timely, accurately, or completely (up to $150,000). For \u201cknowing\u201d failures to report, the penalties increase to not less than $10,000, but not more than $100,000, for each such failure (up to $1,000,000). The amount of civil monetary penalties imposed on each applicable manufacturer or applicable group purchasing organization is aggregated separately. Subject to separate aggregate totals, the maximum combined annual total is $1,150,000.\nSeveral of the U.S. states have parallel reporting laws, sometimes accompanied with \u201cgift bans\u201d prohibiting manufacturers from making gifts or other remunerations to prescribers. Massachusetts and Vermont are two such states. There are various penalties associated with noncompliance with the state laws, as well.\nLegislative and Administrative Action May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Company\nPolitical, economic, and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry in the U.S. to fundamental change. We cannot predict what other legislation relating to our business or to the health care industry may be enacted, including legislation relating to third-party reimbursement, or what effect such legislation may have on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We expect federal and state legislators to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery and payment systems, and possibly adopt legislation affecting further changes in the health care delivery system. Such laws may contain provisions that may change the operating environment for hospitals and managed care organizations. Health care industry participants may react to such legislation by curtailing or deferring expenditures and initiatives, including those relating to our current and futre products. Future legislation could result in modifications to the existing public and private health care insurance systems that would have a material adverse effect on the reimbursement policies discussed above. With growing pressures on government budgets, government efforts to contain or reduce health care spending in some way or another are likely to continue. Any measures to restrict health care spending could result in decreased revenue from products and decrease potential returns from any future research and development initiatives. Furthermore, we may not be able to successfully neutralize any lobbying efforts against any initiatives we may have with governmental agencies. In addition to legislative initiatives, we may be subject to changes in current regulations and policies affecting coverage and reimbursement for our current and future products. Administrative agencies such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have broad discretion to adopt or modify polices through rulemaking, and adoption of rules that curtail access to our products or limit reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on the adoption of our current and future products by health care providers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to Obtain Regulatory Approval in International Jurisdictions Would Prevent Us from Marketing Our Product Abroad\nWe may in the future seek to market some of our product candidates outside the U.S. In order to market our product candidates in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, we must submit clinical data concerning our product candidates and obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval from foreign regulators may be longer than the time required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the U.S. may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the U.S., it is required that the product candidate be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. In some cases, this may include approval of the price we intend to charge for our product, if approved. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the U.S. on a timely basis, or at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the U.S. does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively affect the regulatory process in other countries. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize any products in any market and therefore may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Cyber-Security\nOur Intellectual Property Assets Are Critical to Our Success\nWe regard our trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property assets as critical to our success. We rely on a combination of trademarks, and trade secret and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and other similar measures, to establish and protect our intellectual property. We attempt to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets by restricting access to sensitive information and requiring employees, consultants, and other persons with access to our sensitive information to sign confidentiality agreements. Despite these efforts, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter others from developing similar technology in the future. Furthermore, policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property assets is difficult and expensive. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in any litigation matter relating to our intellectual property assets. Any misappropriation of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase sales of our commercial product and/or continue the development of any future pipeline candidates.\nIf We Are Unable to Protect the Confidentiality of Our Proprietary Information and Know-how, Our Competitive Position Would be Impaired\nA significant amount of our technology, especially regarding manufacturing processes, is unpatented and is maintained by us as trade secrets. The background technologies used in the development of our product candidates are known in the scientific community, and it is possible to duplicate the methods we use to create our product candidates. In an effort to protect these trade secrets, we require our employees, consultants and contractors to execute confidentiality agreements with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements, however, may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information, and these agreements may be breached. Adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. A breach of confidentiality could affect our competitive position. In addition, in some situations, these agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants, collaborators or advisors have previous employment or consulting relationships. Also, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. The disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position.\nIf We Infringe, or Are Alleged to Infringe, Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties, Our Business Could be Harmed\nOur research, development, and commercialization activities, including any product candidates resulting from these activities, may infringe, or be claimed to infringe, patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties, and to which we do not hold licenses or other rights. There may be patent applications owned by third parties that have been filed but not published that, when issued, could be asserted against us. These third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages.\nFurther, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit. We have not conducted an exhaustive search or analysis of third-party patent rights to determine whether our research, development, or commercialization activities, including any product candidates resulting from these activities, may infringe or be alleged to infringe any third-party patent rights. As a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek a license from the third party. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the licensee would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property.\nUltimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. All of the issues described above could also affect our potential collaborators to the extent we have any collaborations then in place, which would also affect the success of the collaboration and therefore us. There has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. In addition to infringement claims against us, we may become a party to other patent litigation and other proceedings, including inter partes review and/or interference proceedings declared by the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office and opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates and technology.\nOur Business May Be Adversely Impacted by Cyber-Security Attacks\nDisruption in our computer systems could adversely affect our business. We rely on computer systems to process transactions, communicate with customers, manage our business, and process and maintain information. Cyber-security attacks are evolving and disruptions can be caused by a variety of events, such as viruses, malicious malware, unauthorized access attempts to data, or other types of cyber-security attacks. Such events could produce disruptions that result in an unexpected delay in operations, loss of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, and expenses related to the repair or replacement of our computer systems. Compromising and/or loss of information could result in loss of sales or legal or regulatory claims which could adversely affect our revenues and profits or damage our reputation.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nA Retail Trading Market for Our Common Stock May Not Resume or Actively Develop.\nDue to the lack of current and publicly available information about the Company, trading in shares of our common stock since September 28, 2021 has been eligible only for unsolicited quotes on the \u201cExpert Market\u201d of the OTC Markets Group. Quotations in Expert Market securities are restricted from public viewing. This designation by the OTC Markets Group severely limits the number of investors that might purchase shares our common stock and effectively prevents the development of an active trading market in our common stock. Even if we become current in filing our financial and other information publicly, there can be no assurance as to whether OTC Markets Group will ever enable shares of our common stock to be quoted on a retail market or whether shares of our common stock can successfully be traded on other trading platforms, or if they do, whether the value of shares of our common stock will return or have any value. As a result, any limited trading of shares of our common stock subject to having a higher risk of wider spreads, increased volatility, and price dislocations.\nTrading on an Over-the-Counter Market Could Adversely Affect the Liquidity of Our Common Stock.\nSubsequent to filing this Form 10-K, shares of our common stock may become eligible for quotations on the OTC Pink or other tier of the OTC Trading Market. Shares of our common stock previously traded on the OTCQB and OTC Pink tiers of the OTC Markets Group. However, trading in our common stock was very limited and we cannot make any assurances that the trading volume will increase, or, if and when it increases, that it will be sustained at any level. Over-the-counter markets are generally considered to be less efficient than, and not as broad as, a stock exchange. Stockholders may have difficulties reselling significant numbers of shares of common stock at any particular time and may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the price paid for such shares. As a result, stockholders may be required to hold shares of common stock for an indefinite period of time. In addition, sales of substantial amounts of common stock could lower the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nU.S. Broker-Dealers May Be Discouraged from Effecting Transactions in Shares of our Common Stock.\nOur Common Stock is deemed a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under SEC rules. As a result, trading in our common stock may be subject to the requirements of SEC rules that require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trades involving a stock defined as a penny stock (generally, any non-exchange listed equity security that has a market price share of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions) and a two business day \u201ccooling off period\u201d before broker and dealers can effect transactions in penny stocks. For these types of transactions, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction before the sale. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to the broker-dealer, current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer\u2019s presumed control over the market. These, and the other burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by the penny stock requirements, could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock, which could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of holders of our common stock to sell it.\nThe Compliance and Reporting Requirements of Being a Public Reporting Company Can Be Expensive.\nWe are a public reporting company and, accordingly, are subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and other federal securities laws, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders is costly. In addition, we may face time consuming and costly effects to develop and implement internal controls and reporting procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nRule 144 May Not Be Available to Holders of Restricted Shares During Any Period in Which We Fail to Comply With our Reporting Obligations Under the Exchange Act.\nFrom time to time, we have issued shares in transactions exempt from registration. Shares issued pursuant to exemptions from registration are \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). As restricted shares, these shares may be resold only pursuant to an effective registration statement or pursuant to Rule 144 or other applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. If we fail to comply with its reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, Rule 144 may not be available to holders of restricted shares, which may limit your ability to sell your restricted shares.\nOur Officers, Directors and Principal Stockholders Can Exert Significant Influence Over Us and May Make Decisions That Are Not in the Best Interests of All Stockholders\nAs of March 15, 2022, our officers and directors beneficially owned approximately 22.8% of our shares of common stock, while our principal stockholders Charles E. Sheedy and Boyalife Asset Holding II, Inc. together beneficially owned an additional approximately 40.7% of our shares of common stock. As a result, our officers, directors, and certain principal holders of common stock are able to affect the outcome of, or exert significant influence over, all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors. This concentration of ownership of our common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us or otherwise discouraging or preventing a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us. This, in turn, could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock, if and when it commences trading. It could also prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market prices for their shares of common stock. Moreover, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders, and accordingly, they could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider.\nTransactions Engaged in by Our Largest Stockholders, Our Directors or Officers Involving Our Common Stock May Have an Adverse Effect on the Value of Our Common Stock\nSales of our common stock by our officers, directors and principal stockholders could have the effect of lowering the price or value of our common stock. The perceived risk associated with the possible sale of a large number of shares of common stock by those stockholders could cause some of our stockholders to sell their stock, thus adversely affecting the value of our common. Our largest stockholders, directors and executive officers may sell a significant number of shares for a variety of reasons unrelated to the performance of our business. Our stockholders may perceive these sales as a reflection on management\u2019s view of the business, which may result in some stockholders selling their shares of our common stock. These sales also could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nVolatility of Our Stock Price Could Adversely Affect Current and Future Stockholders\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate widely in response to various factors which are beyond our control. The price of our common stock is not necessarily indicative of our operating performance or long-term business prospects. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Factors that could cause the market price to fluctuate substantially include, among others:\n\u25cf\nour ability or inability to execute our business plan;\n\u25cf\nthe dilutive effect or perceived dilutive effect of additional equity financings;\n\u25cf\ninvestor perception of our company and of the industry;\n\u25cf\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u25cf\nregulatory developments in the U.S. or overseas;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel; or\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic, political and market conditions.\nThe stock market in general can often experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. Any such market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock. Price volatility could be worse if the trading volume of our common stock is low.", "PERMNO": 90750, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "NUOTQ"}
