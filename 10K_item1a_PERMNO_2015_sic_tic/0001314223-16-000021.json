{"cik": "1314223", "company": "Amber Road, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur operating and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report, which you should consider before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks or others not specified below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Solution\nIf we are unable to attract new customers or our existing customers do not renew their subscriptions, the growth of our business and cash flows will be adversely affected.\nTo increase our revenue and cash flows, we must regularly add new customers. If we are unable to hire or retain effective sales personnel, generate sufficient sales leads through our marketing programs, or if our existing or new customers do not perceive our solution to be of sufficiently high value and quality, we may not be able to increase sales and our operating results would be adversely affected. In addition, our existing customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions, and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate due to a number of factors, including customers\u2019 satisfaction with our solution, our professional services, our customer support, our prices and the prices of competing solutions, as well as mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base, global economic conditions and customers\u2019 spending budgets. If we fail to sell our solution and services to new customers or if our existing customers do not renew their subscriptions, our operating results will suffer, and our revenue growth, cash flows and profitability may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe market for cloud-based GTM solutions is at an early stage of development. If this market does not develop or develops more slowly than we expect, our revenue may decline or fail to grow and we may incur additional operating losses.\nWe derive, and expect to continue to derive, substantially all of our revenue from providing a cloud-based GTM solution and related services. The market for cloud-based GTM solutions is in an early stage of development, and it is uncertain whether these solutions will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. Our success will depend on the willingness of companies to accept our cloud-based GTM solution as an alternative to manual processes, traditional enterprise resource planning software and internally-developed GTM solutions. Some customers may be reluctant or unwilling to use our cloud-based GTM solution for a number of reasons, including existing investments in GTM technology.\nTraditional approaches to GTM automation have required, among other things, purchasing hardware and licensing software. Because these traditional approaches often require significant initial investments to purchase the necessary technology and to establish systems that comply with customers\u2019 unique requirements, companies may be unwilling to abandon their current solutions for our cloud-based GTM solution. Other factors that may limit market acceptance of our solution include:\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain continuity of service for all users of our solution;\n\u2022\nthe price, performance and availability of competing solutions; and\n\u2022\nour ability to address companies\u2019 confidentiality concerns about information stored outside of their premises.\nIf companies do not perceive the benefits of our cloud-based GTM solution, or if companies are unwilling to accept our solution as an alternative to traditional approaches, the market for our solution might not continue to develop or might develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our revenues and growth prospects.\nThe information we source from third parties for inclusion in our Global Knowledge library may not be accurate and complete, our trade experts may make errors in interpreting legal and other requirements when processing this information, and our trade content may not be updated on a timely basis, which can expose our customers to fines and other substantial claims and penalties.\nOur customers often use our solution as a system of record and many of our customers are subject to regulation of their products, services and activities. Our Global Knowledge library includes trade content sourced from government agencies and transportation carriers in numerous countries. It is often sourced from text documents and includes import and export regulations, shipping documents, preferential duties and taxes, specifications for free trade agreements, transportation rates, sailing schedules, embargoed country and restricted party lists, and harmonized tariff codes. The information in these text documents may not be accurate and complete. Our team of trade experts transforms these documents into a normalized and propriety knowledgebase, interpretable by software, and in so doing has to interpret the legal and other requirements contained in the source documents. We can provide no assurances that our trade experts do not make errors in the interpretation of these requirements. Furthermore, rules and regulations and other trade content used in our solution change constantly, and we must continuously update our Global Knowledge library. Maintaining a complete and accurate library is time-consuming and costly and we can provide no assurances that our specialists will always make appropriate updates to the library on a timely basis. Errors or defects in updating the trade content we provide to our customers and any defects or errors in, or failure of, our software, hardware, or systems, can result in an inability to process transactions or lead to violations that could expose our customers to fines and other substantial claims and penalties and involve criminal activity. In addition, these errors and delays may damage our reputation with both existing and new customers and result in lost customers and decreased revenue, which could materially and adversely affect our business, revenue and results of operations.\nAny of these problems may enable our customers to terminate our agreements or we may be required to issue credits or refunds, and may be subject to product liability, breach of warranty or other contractual claims. We also may be required to indemnify our customers or third parties as a result of any of these problems. Any provisions in our customer agreements intended to limit liability may not be sufficient to protect us against any such claims. Insurance may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, any insurance we do have may not cover claims related to specific defects, errors, failures or delays, may not cover indirect or consequential damages, and otherwise may be inadequate, and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management\u2019s attention. In general, losses from customers terminating their agreements with us and our cost of defending claims resulting from defects, errors, failures or delays might be substantial, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur sales cycle can be long and unpredictable and requires considerable time and expense, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate.\nThe sales cycle for our solution, from initial contact with a potential lead to contract execution and implementation, varies widely by customer, and can be lengthy. Some of our customers undertake a significant evaluation process that frequently involves not only our solution, but also solutions of our competitors, which may result in extended sales cycles. Our sales efforts involve educating our customers about the use, technical capabilities and benefits of our solution. We have no assurance that the substantial time and money spent on our sales efforts will produce any sales. Furthermore, our sales and marketing efforts in a given period may only result in sales in subsequent periods, or not at all. If we do not realize sales from a customer in the time period expected or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe complexity of our sales and implementation cycles exposes us to operational risks that we must manage carefully.\nThe complexity of our sales and implementation cycles makes predicting the time to close a sale and implement our solution difficult, thereby exposing us to operational risks. The length of these cycles depends on our customers\u2019 motivation and the resources they devote to the process. If our sales or implementation cycles are longer than we anticipate, we may face staffing shortages or cost overruns.\nIf our customers are not satisfied with our solution implementation, we could incur additional costs to address these issues, reducing our professional services revenue and the opportunity to sell additional solution modules to these customers. In addition, any negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers.\nWe face intense competition, and our failure to compete successfully would make it difficult for us to add and retain customers and would impede the growth of our business.\nThe GTM solutions market is fragmented, competitive and rapidly evolving. We compete with GTM vendors, traditional enterprise resource planning vendors such SAP and Oracle, and other service providers, as well as with solutions developed\ninternally by enterprises seeking to manage their global trade. Some of our actual and potential competitors may enjoy competitive advantages over us, such as greater name recognition, more varied offerings and larger marketing budgets, as well as greater financial, technical and other resources. Furthermore, some competitors may have best-of-breed solutions to problems created by the unique trading requirements of particular countries. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services than we can.\nThe intensity of competition in the GTM market has resulted in pricing pressure as the market has developed and our competitors very frequently offer substantial price discounts for their products. We expect the intensity of competition to increase in the future as existing competitors develop their capabilities and as new companies, which could include one or more large software or trade content providers, enter our market. Increased competition could result in additional pricing pressure, reduced sales, shorter term lengths for customer contracts, lower margins or the failure of our solution to achieve or maintain broad market acceptance. If we are unable to compete effectively, it will be difficult for us to maintain our pricing rates and add and retain customers, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.\nWe may expand by acquiring or investing in other companies, which may divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and consume resources that are necessary to sustain our business.\nAlthough we have no current definitive agreements or commitments for any acquisitions, our business strategy includes acquiring complementary services, technologies or businesses to augment our solution capabilities and sales platform, particularly in foreign markets. We also may enter into relationships with, or invest in, other businesses to expand our service offerings or our ability to provide service in foreign jurisdictions. Negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to close these transactions may often be subject to approvals that are beyond our control. Consequently, these transactions, even if undertaken and announced, may not close.\nAn acquisition, investment or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, solutions, personnel or operations of the acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us, the company\u2019s technology is not easily adapted to work with ours or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in management or otherwise. Acquisitions may also disrupt our business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our business. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment or business relationship may not be realized or we may be exposed to unknown liabilities. Our acquisitions may not be successfully integrated or any such acquisitions may not otherwise be successful. If our acquisitions are unsuccessful for any reason, our business may be harmed and the value of your investment may decline.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to develop and market new and enhanced solution modules, and we may not be able to do so, or do so quickly enough to respond to changes in demand. Even if we anticipate changes in demand, it may be difficult for us to transition existing customers to new versions of our solution.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to develop and market new and enhanced solution modules, and to do so on a timely basis. Successful module development and marketing depends on numerous factors, including anticipating customer requirements, changes in technology requirements, our ability to differentiate our solution from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of our solutions. Enterprises are requiring their software application vendors to provide ever increasing levels of functionality and broader offerings. Moreover, our industry is characterized by rapid evolution, and shifts in technology and customer needs. We may not be able to develop and market new or enhanced modules in a timely or cost-effective manner or at all. Our solution also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly anticipate technological changes or the changing needs of our customers or potential customers.\nIn addition, even if we correctly anticipate changes in technology or demand, it might be difficult for us to transition existing customers to new versions of our solution. Such transitions or upgrades may require considerable professional services effort and expense and customers may choose to discontinue using our solution rather than proceed with a lengthy and expensive upgrade. If customers fail to accept new versions of our solution, if our newest solution contains errors, or if we expend too many resources supporting multiple versions of our solution, we may suffer a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur cost structure is relatively fixed in the short term, which makes it difficult to reduce our expenses quickly in response to declines in revenue or revenue growth.\nMost of our expenses, such as those associated with headcount and facilities, as well as those involved with maintaining our extensive Global Knowledge database, are relatively fixed and can be difficult to reduce in the short term. Our expense\nlevels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels. As a result, if revenue for a particular quarter is below our expectations, our expenses for that quarter may constitute a larger percentage of our operating budget than we planned, causing a disproportionately negative effect on our expected results of operations and profitability for that quarter.\nOur solution is complex and customers may experience difficulty in implementing, upgrading or otherwise achieving the benefits attributable to it.\nDue to the scope and complexity of the solution that we provide, our implementation cycle can be lengthy and unpredictable. Our solution requires configuration and must integrate with many existing computer systems and applications of our customers and their trading partners. This can be time-consuming and expensive for our customers and can result in delays in the implementation of our solution. As a result, some customers have had, and may in the future have, difficulty implementing our solution successfully or otherwise achieving the expected benefits of our solution. Delayed or ineffective implementation or upgrades of our solution may limit our future sales opportunities, negatively affect revenue, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation.\nWe have different revenue recognition policies for professional services depending on our solution deployment model, and, as a result, our revenue, gross profit and operating results may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter and be adversely affected depending on the model our customers choose.\nWe generally employ two different deployment models for our solution and our revenue and operating results may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter depending on the model that our customers choose. Customers access our solution using either our cloud-based infrastructure or by deploying our solution on their own premises. Regardless of the delivery model, we sell our solution through subscription agreements that entitle our customers to access our solution and receive support, and we generally charge for professional services to implement the solution on a time and materials basis.\nFor customers who select our cloud-based solution deployment model, we recognize all revenue for our related professional services as we perform them. For customers who deploy our solution on their own premises, we recognize professional services revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription period. However, we recognize the costs of providing professional services as we incur them under either deployment model, and as a result, in any given period where we deliver professional services to on-premises customers, our revenue, gross profit and operating results may fluctuate substantially and will be adversely affected by this different revenue recognition treatment, especially in comparison to professional services delivered to our cloud-based customers.\nIf unauthorized persons breach our security measures, or those of third parties that provide infrastructure for, or components of, our GTM solution, they could access client data, leading clients to curtail or stop their use of our solution, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur GTM solution involves the storage and transmission of confidential information of customers, including certain financial data. We may also in the course of our service engagements have access to confidential customer information. If unauthorized persons breach our security measures, or those of third parties that provide infrastructure for, or components of, our solution as a result of employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party obtains access to this confidential data, our reputation and business would suffer, and we could incur significant liability. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not discovered until launched against a target. As a result, we and our third-party providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our solutions occurs, the market perception of our solution could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers.\nSelling our solution and services internationally subjects us to various risks.\nExpanding our GTM software solution internationally is important to our growth and profitability. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, 17% of our revenue was attributable to sales in international markets. We intend to further expand our sales efforts internationally to other countries, which will require financial resources and management attention and may subject us to new or increased levels of risk. We cannot be assured that we will be successful in creating new international demand for our solution and services.\nBy doing business in international markets, we are exposed to risks separate and distinct from those we face in our domestic operations, and if we are unable to manage these risks effectively, it may harm the growth and profitability of our business.\nEngaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets;\n\u2022\nburdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign customs, laws and regulations, and with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships;\n\u2022\ninternational terrorism and anti-American sentiment;\n\u2022\npossible future limitations on the ownership of foreign businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems or difficulty collecting international accounts receivable or longer accounts receivable payment cycles; and\n\u2022\nless effective protection of intellectual property.\nOur exposure to each of these risks may increase our costs, impair our ability to market and sell our solution and services, and require significant management attention. Our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the realization of any of these risks.\nOur software is complex and may contain material undetected errors, which could enable or otherwise cause our customers to terminate or not renew their subscriptions, damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, revenue and results of operations.\nOur software is inherently complex and, despite extensive testing and quality control, may contain material undetected errors or failures especially when first introduced or as new versions are released. Failures or errors in our software could result in data loss or corruption. We may not find errors in new or enhanced solution modules before we release them and such errors may not be discovered by us or our customers until after we have implemented these modules. These errors in our modules could enable or otherwise cause our customers to terminate or not renew their subscriptions. In addition, they may damage our reputation with both existing and new customers and result in lost customers and decreased revenue, which could materially and adversely affect our business, revenue and results of operations.\nIndustry consolidation may result in increased competition.\nThe GTM market is highly fragmented, and we believe that it is likely that some of our existing competitors will consolidate or will be acquired. Some of our competitors have made or may make acquisitions or may enter into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than they individually had offered. We expect consolidation in the industry as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions. This could result in competitors with greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, service and other resources than us. The companies resulting from such combinations may eliminate gaps in their solutions, including a lack of integrated or comprehensive trade content, and these combinations may create more intense competition. Any such consolidation, acquisition, alliance or cooperative relationship could lead to pricing pressure, erosion of our margins, and loss of market share, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have a history of losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our formation, including net losses of $14.4 million in 2013, $27.7 million in 2014, and $28.1 million in 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $136.2 million. As part of our strategy to develop and expand our business, we have increased sales and marketing expenses to attract additional customers, as well as research and development expenses to further develop our solution and services. These efforts may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. Any failure to increase our revenue or generate revenue from developing new modules and expanding our services could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. In addition, as a public company, we will continue to incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. Furthermore, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may result in continuing or greater losses in future periods. You should not consider our historical revenue growth rates to be indicative of our future performance. We cannot be certain that we will be able to attain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis, or if we do, that we will sustain profitability.\nUncertainty in global economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur operations and performance depend on global economic conditions. Challenging or uncertain economic conditions make it difficult for our customers and potential customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and may cause our customers and potential customers to slow, reduce or fail to commence spending on our solution. Furthermore, during challenging or uncertain economic times, our customers may face difficulties gaining timely access to sufficient credit and experience decreasing cash flow, which could affect their willingness to make purchases and their ability to make timely payments to us. Global economic conditions have in the past, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on demand for\nour solution, on our ability to predict future operating results and on our financial condition and operating results. If global economic conditions remain uncertain or deteriorate, it may materially affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDeclines in new subscriptions or in the rate of renewal of our subscriptions may not be fully reflected in our current period operating results and could lead to future revenue shortfalls that could affect our results of operations.\nIn 2015, we derived 70% of our total revenue from subscription agreements. We recognize revenue from these subscriptions over the term of the agreement, and accordingly downturns or upturns in new or renewal subscriptions may not be fully reflected in our current period operating results. If our new and renewal subscriptions in any period decline or fail to grow at a rate consistent with our historical trends, our revenue in future periods could fall short of analysts\u2019 expectations which, in turn, could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nWe rely entirely on our own employees to sell and implement our solution and may be at a disadvantage compared to competitors that utilize external channels.\nMany enterprise software companies, including some of our competitors, utilize partner networks to sell and deploy their solutions. These partners can include consulting companies of national reputation who may have established relationships with our potential customers. The dedication of a national consulting company to a particular GTM offering enhances the reputation of that offering in the marketplace. To date, we have relied entirely on our own sales and professional services employees to sell and implement our solution, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. To increase our revenue and cash flows, we must regularly add new customers and maintain the ability to provide them with timely professional services. If we are unable to do so on our own, the market perception of our solution could be harmed and we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we lose the services of our Chief Executive Officer or other members of our senior management team, it could impair our ability to execute our business strategy and our sales and profitability could suffer.\nOur success and future growth depend on the skills, working relationships and continued services of our senior management team and in particular, our Chief Executive Officer, James W. Preuninger. In the event that we are unable to retain the services of any of these key contributors, we may be unable to execute our business strategy in a timely manner, if at all, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract, integrate and retain key personnel.\nOur success in the highly competitive GTM solutions market depends largely on our ability to attract, integrate and retain highly skilled managerial, solution, engineering, trade content and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for these personnel in our industry is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain the appropriately qualified, highly skilled employees necessary for the development of our solution and services and the growth of our business, or to replace personnel who leave our employ in the future. The loss of services of any of our key personnel, the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future, or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly global trade subject matter experts, information technology professionals and project managers, could make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective upgrades and introductions, penetration and expansion into existing accounts and growth in the GTM solutions market.\nOur growth is dependent upon the continued development and retention of our direct sales force and any failure to hire and/or retain these personnel may impede our growth.\nWe have invested extensively in our direct sales force. We believe that our future growth will depend on the continued development of this sales force and their ability to obtain new customers, particularly enterprise customers, and to manage our existing customer base. Our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining a sufficient number of direct sales personnel. New sales personnel require significant training and may, in some cases, take more than a year before becoming productive, if at all. If we are unable to hire and develop sufficient numbers of productive direct sales personnel, sales of our GTM solution and related services will suffer and our growth will be impeded.\nWe are exposed to exchange rate risks on foreign currencies that may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nBecause most of our international sales are denominated in the currency of the country where the purchaser is located, as we continue to expand our direct sales presence in international regions, the portion of our accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase. In addition, we incur significant costs related to our operations in India in Rupees, and we also incur costs related to our operations in China in RMD and in Hong Kong in HKD,\nwhich will continue to increase. As a result, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies may affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flow. Our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates exist with respect to the Euro, the Rupee and Renminbi, which together represented approximately 17% of revenue and approximately 12% of our cost of revenue in 2015. We do not currently hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Any hedging policies we may implement in the future may not be successful, and the cost of those hedging techniques may have a significant negative effect on our operating results.\nInterruptions or delays in the delivery of our GTM solution could impair the availability or use of our solution, resulting in customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation, loss of customers, limited growth and reduction in revenue.\nWe host our GTM, SCC and CTM solutions for our cloud delivery model customers in appropriately located and highly secure co-location facilities. Design or mechanical errors, power losses, spikes in usage volume, hardware failures, systems failures, communications failures, failure to follow system protocols and procedures, intentional bad acts, natural disasters, war, terrorist attacks or security breaches, including cyber attacks, could cause our systems to fail, resulting in interruptions in our service.\nOther interruptions or delays in delivering our GTM, SCC and CTM solutions can result from changes to or termination of our arrangements with the owners of the facilities. The owners of our facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to transfer to one or more new data center facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in doing so.\nIn addition, our Jacksonville, Florida data center\u2019s location may make it relatively susceptible to tropical storms and hurricanes, which, depending on severity, could also cause interruptions or delays in the delivery of our solution. All of our GTM solutions are hosted primarily from our Jacksonville facility, and our Carlstadt, New Jersey facility acts as a disaster recovery site that can host our solution following a catastrophic event at our Jacksonville co-location facility. For customers who do not have real time replication of their data to our Carlstadt facility, it can take us a substantial amount of time to migrate them to Carlstadt and restore functionality for them.\nMany of our customers may consider our GTM solution to be \u201cmission critical,\u201d and any delay in restoring our solution may be unacceptable to customers. Although we conduct disaster recovery tests annually and are capable of bringing our solution online following catastrophe scenarios, any equipment failures and delays in restoring our solution could enable or otherwise cause our customers to terminate or not renew their subscriptions. In addition, they may damage our reputation with both existing and new customers and result in lost customers and decreased revenue, which could materially and adversely affect our business, revenue and results of operations.\nIf we fail to manage our international operations effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have offices in the United States, Germany, India and China, and plan to continue our international expansion. Managing a geographically dispersed workforce in multiple time zones in compliance with diverse local laws and customs is challenging. If we fail to manage our international workforce effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nPolitical, economic, social and other factors in India and China may adversely affect our operations and our ability to achieve our business objectives.\nWe have offices in Bangalore, India, in which the majority of our engineers are situated. Since the early 1990s, the Indian government has been implementing an economic structural reform program with the objective of liberalizing India\u2019s exchange and trade policies, reducing the fiscal deficit, controlling inflation, promoting a sound monetary policy, reforming the financial sector, and placing greater reliance on market mechanisms to direct economic activity. While economic liberalization efforts in India continue, there can be no assurance that these economic reforms will persist, and that any newly elected government will continue the program of economic liberalization of previous governments. In addition, despite the economic reforms, India continues to have relatively poor business conditions.\nIndia has also experienced terrorist attacks in the past decade. Religious and border disputes persist and remain pressing problems. Military hostilities and civil unrest in Afghanistan, Iraq and other Asian countries persist. These events could adversely influence the Indian economy and, as a result, materially and adversely affect our operations and our ability to achieve our business objectives.\nWe conduct our business in China through several Chinese subsidiaries. The results of operations and future prospects of our Chinese subsidiaries are subject to evolving economic, political and social developments in China. In particular, these results may be adversely affected by changes in China\u2019s political, economic and social conditions, changes in policies of the Chinese government, changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, changes in foreign exchange regulations, measures that may be introduced to control inflation, and changes in the rates or methods of taxation. Also, Chinese commercial laws, regulations and interpretations applicable to non-Chinese owned market participants such as us are continually changing. These laws, regulations and interpretations could impose restrictions on our ownership or operations of our interests in China and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect the operations of our Chinese subsidiaries.\nOur Chinese subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China. There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of laws, rules and policies in China. The Chinese legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions have limited precedential value. Because many laws and regulations are relatively new and the Chinese legal system is still evolving, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform. Moreover, the relative inexperience of China\u2019s judiciary in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation, and the interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political agendas. Finally, enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic. As a result of the forgoing, it may be difficult for us to obtain swift or equitable enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to protect companies like ours, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may need additional funding and we may be unable to raise capital when needed, which could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our solution development programs.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to enhance existing and develop new modules, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired. In that case, we may not be able to, among other things, develop or enhance our solution, continue to expand our sales and marketing, acquire complementary technologies, solutions or businesses, expand operations in the United States or internationally, hire, train and retain employees, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements. Our failure to do any of these things could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of amounts that have been accrued.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and we may take certain income tax positions on our tax returns with which tax authorities may disagree. When necessary, we provide reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions. However, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax regulations to our global operations in many jurisdictions. Therefore, any dispute with any tax authority may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities associated with our returns.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our effective tax rate. There are several proposals to reform United States tax rules being considered by law makers, including proposals that may reduce or eliminate the deferral of United States income tax on our unrepatriated earnings, potentially requiring those earnings to be taxed at the U.S. federal income tax rate, reduce or eliminate our ability to claim foreign tax credits, and eliminate various tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the United States. At December 31, 2015, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $73.5 million. Our future reported financial results may be adversely affected by tax rule changes which restrict or eliminate our ability to utilize net operating loss carry-forwards, claim foreign tax credits or deduct expenses attributable to foreign earnings, or otherwise affect the treatment of our unrepatriated earnings.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset our taxable income. Specifically, this limitation may arise in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of our company of more than 50% within a three-year period. Any such annual limitation may significantly reduce the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire. Our prior business acquisitions, and our 2014 initial public offering (IPO), alone or together with transactions that may occur in the future, could limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset our taxable income, if any. Any such limitation, whether as the result of our prior business acquisitions, the IPO, sales of common stock by our existing stockholders or additional sales of common stock by us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future years. We have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change occurred as a result of the IPO, or whether there have been one or more ownership changes since our inception, due to the costs and complexities associated with such study. Accordingly, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments may be currently limited or may be limited as a result of the IPO or any future issuance of shares of our stock.\nIf we are unable to manage our expected growth, our performance may suffer.\nOur business has grown rapidly, and if we are successful in executing our business strategy, this growth will continue as we leverage our existing customer relationships, expand internationally, increase our solution offerings and execute strategic acquisitions. We will need to continue to expand our managerial, operational, financial and other systems and resources to manage our operations, continue our research and development activities, increase our sales force and expand our professional services team. It is possible that our management, finance, development personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Our need to effectively manage our operations and growth requires that we continue to develop more robust business processes and improve our systems and procedures in each of these areas and attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees. We may be unable to successfully implement these tasks on a larger scale and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development and growth goals.\nOur loan and security agreement with our lender contains operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nWe are party to a credit agreement in connection with our term loan and revolving line of credit. Borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding intellectual property. Our credit agreement contains customary restrictions and requires us to maintain a minimum cash balance as well as a maximum leverage ratio.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the credit agreement, as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into, restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet those covenants. From time to time we may be required to seek waivers, a forbearance or an amendment to the credit agreement in order to maintain compliance with these covenants, and there can be no certainty that any such waiver, amendment or forbearance will be available, or what the cost of such waiver, amendment or forbearance, if obtained, would be. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the credit agreement, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under our line of credit to become immediately due and payable, terminate all commitments to extend further credit and permit our lender to take possession of and sell our assets pledged as collateral.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash available to repay our debt obligations when they become due and payable, either when they mature or in the event of a default, we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which may negatively affect our ability to continue as a going concern.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights in internally developed software and other materials and efforts to protect them may be costly.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our software and other materials that we have developed internally. We hold no issued or pending patents and have relied largely on copyright, trade secret and, to a lesser extent, trademark laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and agreements with our employees, consultants, customers and vendors, to control access to, ownership of and distribution of technology, software, documentation and other confidential information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain, use or distribute our technology, software and/or documentation without authorization. If this were to occur, we could lose revenue as a result of competition from products infringing or\nmisappropriating our technology and intellectual property and we may be required to initiate litigation to protect our proprietary rights and market position.\nUnited States copyright and trade secret laws offer us only limited protection and the laws of some foreign countries protect proprietary rights to an even lesser extent. Accordingly, defense of our proprietary technology may become an increasingly important issue as we continue to expand our operations and technology development into countries that provide a lower level of intellectual property protection than the United States. Policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and the steps we take may not prevent misappropriation of the technology we rely on. If competitors are able to use our technology without recourse, our ability to compete would be harmed and our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may elect to initiate litigation in the future to enforce or protect our proprietary rights or to determine the validity and scope of our rights or the rights of others. That litigation may not be ultimately successful and could result in substantial costs to us, the reduction or loss in intellectual property protection for our technology, the diversion of our management attention and harm to our reputation, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAssertions by any other third party that we infringe its intellectual property, whether successful or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation and expensive licenses.\nThe software and technology industries are characterized by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights. For example, in 2011 a non-practicing entity claimed that our solution infringed one of its patents. Although we successfully defended this claim, we cannot be certain that our solution and services do not infringe the intellectual property rights of other third parties. Additionally, because our software is integrated with our customers\u2019 business processes and other software applications, third parties may bring claims of infringement or misappropriation against us, as well as our customers and other software suppliers. Claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties could be asserted against us in the future. We cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claim. In addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary information, some of our solution modules contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement or misappropriation claims with respect to these third party technologies.\nClaims of alleged infringement of third party intellectual property rights may have a material adverse effect on our business. Any intellectual property rights claim made against us or our customers, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, and could divert management attention and financial resources. An adverse determination could prevent us from offering our modules or services to our customers and may require that we procure or develop substitute modules or services that do not infringe. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements. We may be unable to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. Furthermore, many of our license agreements require us to indemnify and defend our customers for certain third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay damages if there were an adverse ruling related to any such claims. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a customer and a third party, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our services and solution in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party. Moreover, such infringement claims may harm our relationships with our existing customers and may deter future customers from purchasing our solution on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of employees\u2019 former employers.\nWe could in the future be subject to claims that we or our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of our employees\u2019 former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending against such claims, a court could order us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to our solution if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. In addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to develop, market and support new solution modules or enhancements to existing modules, which could severely harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, such litigation could result in substantial costs and distract management.\nEvolving regulation of the Internet may increase our expenditures related to compliance efforts, which may adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. We are particularly sensitive to these risks because the Internet and cloud computing are critical components of our business model. For example, we believe that increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy on the Internet, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers\u2019 ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for solutions accessed via the Internet and restricting our ability to store, process and share certain data with our clients via the Internet. In addition, taxation of services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our executive officers, directors, current 5% or greater (affiliate or non-affiliate) stockholders, and their respective affiliates together beneficially own or control, in aggregate, approximately 63% of the shares of our common stock outstanding. As a result, these executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, were they to act together, would be able to significantly influence most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all or of our assets or any other significant corporate transaction. Corporate action might be taken even if other stockholders oppose such action. Those stockholders may delay or prevent a change of control or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of our company, even if such change of control would benefit our other stockholders. This concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect investors\u2019 perception of our corporate governance or delay, prevent or cause a change in control of our company, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.\nFluctuations in the price of our common stock could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. The trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in our common stock. In such circumstances, the trading price of our common stock may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nThe market price for our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u2022\nthe effects of seasonality on our business cycle;\n\u2022\nsuccess of competitive solutions and services;\n\u2022\nour operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period or failure of securities analysts to publish reports about us or our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our company, the GTM market, or the software industry in general;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nnews reports relating to trends in global trade, including changes in estimates of the future size and growth rate of our markets;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new offerings or improvements, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nour ability to market new and enhanced solution modules on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving our company, our general industry, or both;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022\nthe volume of shares of our common stock available for public sale;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board or management;\n\u2022\nsales of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors, executive officers or principal stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general and the market for technology companies and software companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of ours, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for technology or software stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us, the opportunities in the GTM market or the stock market in general, could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against the affected company. This type of litigation, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and distract our management.\nThe JOBS Act allows us to postpone the date by which we must comply with certain laws and regulations intended to protect investors and to reduce the amount of information we provide in our reports filed with the SEC, which could undermine investor confidence in our company and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nUnder the JOBS Act we are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we will, in general, qualify as an emerging growth company until the earliest of:\n\u2022\nthe last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering of common equity securities;\n\u2022\nthe last day of our fiscal year in which we have annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more;\n\u2022\nthe date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; and\n\u2022\nthe date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d which will occur at such time as we (a) have an aggregate worldwide market value of common equity securities held by non-affiliates of $700 million or more as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (b) have been required to file annual and quarterly reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for a period of at least 12 months, and (c) have filed at least one annual report pursuant to the Securities Act of 1934.\nUnder this definition, we could remain an emerging growth company until as late as December 31, 2019.\nThe JOBS Act provides that, so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we will, among other things:\n\u2022\nbe exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nbe exempt from the \u201csay on pay\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers) and the \u201csay on golden parachute\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations) of the Dodd-Frank Act and certain disclosure requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to compensation of our chief executive officer;\n\u2022\nbe permitted to omit the detailed compensation discussion and analysis from proxy statements and reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and instead provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation; and\n\u2022\nbe exempt from any rules that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report on the financial statements.\nWe currently intend to and continue to take advantage of some or all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements available to us so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d except that we have irrevocably elected not to take advantage of the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 102(b) of the JOBS Act. Among other things, this means that our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting so long as\nwe qualify as an emerging growth company, which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected. Likewise, so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we may elect not to provide you with certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of our executive officers, that we would otherwise have been required to provide in filings we make with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our company. As a result, investor confidence in our company and the market price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to numerous financial and other reporting and corporate governance requirements that may be difficult for us to satisfy. Corporate governance and public disclosure regulations may result in additional expenses and continuing uncertainty.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, which will impose significant compliance obligations upon us, particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company. These obligations will require a commitment of additional resources and divert our senior management\u2019s time and attention from our day-to-day operations. We may not be successful in complying with these obligations, and compliance with these obligations will be time-consuming and expensive.\nThe Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing the costly process of implementing and testing our systems to report our results as a public company, to continue to manage our growth and to implement internal controls. We are and will continue to be required to implement and maintain various other control and business systems related to our equity, finance, treasury, information technology, other recordkeeping systems and other operations. As a result of this implementation and maintenance, management's attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in our financial statements and our company, which could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nIn order to provide reliable financial reports, mitigate the risk of fraud and operate successfully as a publicly traded company, we must maintain effective control over our financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nCommencing this fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we will be required to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of that fiscal year. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that is identified by management. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm will also be required to consider our internal controls over financial reporting and express an opinion as to their effectiveness. If our management or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to conclude that such internal control is effective. We are in the very early stages of the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or, when we are no longer an emerging growth company, if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have a materially adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on the appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and covenants in our loan and security agreement also prevent us from paying cash dividends. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund our future growth and do not expect to declare or pay any dividend on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only realize a gain on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a price above your cost after accounting for any taxes. The price of our common stock may not appreciate in value or ever exceed the price at which our stockholders purchased their shares.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions in Delaware law, might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our corporate governance documents include provisions: (i) dividing our board of directors into three classes with staggered three-year terms; (ii) denying cumulative voting rights to stockholders; (iii) specifying that directors may be removed by our stockholders only for cause upon the vote of two thirds or more of our outstanding common stock; (iv) specifying that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors; (v) eliminating the right of stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting; (vi) specifying that only our chairman of the board, Chief Executive Officer or the board of directors may call a special meeting of stockholders; (vii) limiting stockholder proposals to nominate director candidates to those for which timely advance notice was provided; and (viii) limiting stockholder amendments of the foregoing provisions to a vote of at least two thirds of our outstanding common stock. These provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law, which prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nFuture sales, or the availability for sale, of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. As of February 29, 2016, we had 26,326,947 shares of common stock outstanding. All shares of our common stock sold in the IPO are freely transferable without restriction or additional registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The remaining shares outstanding became available for sale upon the expiration of the 180-day lock-up period on September 16, 2014, if applicable, subject to volume and other restrictions as applicable under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. To the extent these shares are sold into the market, the market price of our common stock could decline.", "PERMNO": 14499, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "AMBR"}
