The following is a description of some of the significant factors that might materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDecreases in disposable income and general market volatility in the U.S. and global economy may adversely affect the Company. Spending patterns in the footwear market, particularly those in the moderate-priced market in which a majority of the Company\u2019s products compete, have historically been correlated with consumers\u2019 disposable income. As a result, the success of the Company is affected by changes in general economic conditions, especially in the United States. Factors affecting discretionary income for the moderate consumer include, among others, general business conditions, gas and energy costs, employment, consumer confidence, interest rates and taxation. Additionally, the economy and consumer behavior can impact the financial strength and buying patterns of retailers, which can also affect the Company\u2019s results. Volatile, unstable or weak economic conditions, or a worsening of conditions, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales volume and overall performance.\nVolatility and uncertainty in the U.S. and global credit markets could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. U.S. and global financial markets have recently been, and continue to be, unstable and unpredictable, which has generally resulted in tightened credit markets with heightened lending standards and terms. Volatility and instability in the credit markets pose various risks to the Company, including, among others, negatively impacting retailer and consumer confidence, limiting the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 access to credit markets and interfering with the normal commercial relationships between the Company and its customers. Increased credit risks associated with the financial condition of some customers in the retail industry affects their level of purchases from the Company and the collectability of amounts owed to the Company, and in some cases, causes the Company to reduce or cease shipments to certain customers who no longer meet the Company\u2019s credit requirements.\nIn addition, weak economic conditions and unstable and volatile financial markets could lead to certain of the Company\u2019s customers experiencing cash flow problems, which may force them into higher default rates or to file for bankruptcy protection which may increase the Company\u2019s bad debt expense or further negatively impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to risks related to operating in the retail environment that could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business. The Company is subject to risks associated with doing business in the retail environment, primarily in the United States. The U.S. retail industry has experienced a growing trend toward consolidation of large retailers. The merger of major retailers could result in the Company losing sales volume or increasing its concentration of business with a few large accounts, resulting in reduced bargaining power, which could increase pricing pressures and lower the Company\u2019s margins.\nAs the popularity of online shopping for consumer goods increases, the Company\u2019s retail partners may experience decreased foot traffic which could negatively impact their businesses. This may, in turn, negatively impact the Company\u2019s sales to those customers, and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nChanges in consumer preferences could negatively impact the Company. The Company\u2019s success is dependent upon its ability to accurately anticipate and respond to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. Failure to predict or respond to trends or preferences could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s sales volume and overall performance.\nThe Company relies on independent foreign sources of production and the availability of leather, rubber and other raw materials which could have unfavorable effects on the Company\u2019s business. The Company purchases all of its products from independent foreign manufacturers, primarily in China and India. Although the Company has good working relationships with its manufacturers, the Company does not have long-term contracts with them. Thus, the Company could experience increases in manufacturing costs, disruptions in the timely supply of products or unanticipated reductions in manufacturing capacity, any of which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company has the ability to move production to different suppliers; however, the transition may not occur smoothly or quickly, which could result in the Company missing customer delivery date requirements and, consequently, the Company could lose future orders.\nThe Company\u2019s use of foreign sources of production results in long production and delivery lead times. Therefore, the Company typically forecasts demand at least five months in advance. If the Company\u2019s forecasts are wrong, it could result in the loss of sales if the Company does not have enough product on hand or in reduced margins if the Company has excess inventory that needs to be sold at discounted prices.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may be affected by disruptions at U.S. or foreign ports or other transportation facilities, such as labor disputes and work stoppages, political unrest, severe weather, or security requirements in the United States and other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to its customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transportation costs, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s overall profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s products depend on the availability of raw materials, especially leather and rubber. Any significant shortages of quantities or increases in the cost of leather or rubber could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nAdditional risks associated with foreign sourcing that could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business include adverse changes in foreign economic conditions, import regulations, restrictions on the transfer of funds, duties, tariffs, quotas and political or labor interruptions, foreign currency fluctuations, expropriation and nationalization.\nThe Company conducts business globally, which exposes it to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations as well as political and economic risks. A portion of the Company\u2019s revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company is therefore subject to foreign currency risks and foreign exchange exposure. The Company\u2019s primary exposures are to the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. Exchange rates can be volatile and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company is exposed to other risks of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, including political, economic or social instability, acts of terrorism, changes in government policies and regulations, and exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption laws (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act). The Company is also exposed to risks relating to U.S. policy with respect to companies doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Legislation or other changes in the U.S. tax laws or interpretations could increase the Company\u2019s U.S. income tax liability and adversely affect the Company\u2019s after-tax profitability. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nRecently enacted U.S. tax legislation, as well as future U.S. tax legislation, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. On December 22, 2017, a comprehensive tax reform bill commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d) was enacted. The TCJA made significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws. The Company has performed a preliminary assessment of the impact of the TCJA. However, as the TCJA is complex and far-reaching, there could be future effects that the Company has not identified, or future regulatory guidance, that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive environment, which may result in lower prices and reduced profits. The footwear market is extremely competitive. The Company competes with manufacturers, distributors and retailers of men\u2019s, women\u2019s and children\u2019s shoes, some of which are larger and have substantially greater resources than the Company. The Company competes with these companies primarily on the basis of price, quality, service and brand recognition, all of which are important competitive factors in the shoe industry. The Company\u2019s ability to maintain its competitive edge depends upon these factors, as well as its ability to deliver new products at the best value for the consumer, maintain positive brand recognition, and obtain sufficient retail floor space and effective product presentation at retail. If the Company does not remain competitive, future results of operations and financial condition could decline.\nThe Company is dependent on information and communication systems to support its business and internet sales. Significant interruptions could disrupt its business. The Company accepts and fills the majority of its larger customers\u2019 orders through the use of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). It relies on its warehouse management system to efficiently process orders. The corporate office relies on computer systems to efficiently process and record transactions. Significant interruptions in the Company\u2019s information and communication systems from power loss, telecommunications failure or computer system failure could significantly disrupt the Company\u2019s business and operations. In addition, the Company sells footwear on its websites, and failures of the Company\u2019s or other retailers\u2019 websites could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales and results.\nThe Company, particularly its retail segment and its internet businesses, is subject to the risk of data loss and security breaches. The Company sells footwear in its retail stores and on its websites, and therefore the Company and/or its third party credit card processors must process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including personal information of its customers. Failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches, including breaches of Company technology and systems, could expose the Company or its customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information, adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results, result in litigation or potential liability for the Company, and otherwise harm the Company\u2019s business and/or reputation. In order to address these risks, the Company has secured cyber insurance and it uses third party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Although the Company has developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security.\nThe Company may not be able to successfully integrate new brands and businesses. The Company has completed a number of acquisitions in the past and intends to continue to look for new acquisition opportunities. Those search efforts could be unsuccessful and costs could be incurred in any failed efforts. Further, if and when an acquisition occurs, the Company cannot\nguarantee that it will be able to successfully integrate the brand into its current operations, or that any acquired brand would achieve results in line with the Company\u2019s historical performance or its specific expectations for the brand.\nLoss of the services of the Company\u2019s top executives could adversely affect the business. Thomas W. Florsheim, Jr., the Company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John W. Florsheim, the Company\u2019s President, Chief Operating Officer and Assistant Secretary, have a strong heritage within the Company and the footwear industry. They possess knowledge, relationships and reputations based on their lifetime exposure to and experience in the Company and the industry. The loss of either one or both of the Company\u2019s top executives could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s performance.\nThe limited public float and trading volume for the Company\u2019s stock may have an adverse impact on the stock price or make it difficult to liquidate. The Company\u2019s common stock is held by a relatively small number of shareholders. The Florsheim family owns approximately 35% of the stock and one institutional shareholder holds a significant block. Other officers, directors, and members of management own stock or have the potential to own stock through previously granted stock options and restricted stock. Consequently, the Company has a relatively small float and low average daily trading volume, which could affect a shareholder\u2019s ability to sell stock or the price at which it can be sold. In addition, future sales of substantial amounts of the Company\u2019s common stock in the public market by large shareholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, may adversely impact the market price of the stock and the stock could be difficult for the shareholder to liquidate.\nDeterioration of the municipal bond market in general or of specific municipal bonds held by the Company or its pension plan may result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. The Company maintains an investment portfolio consisting primarily of investment-grade municipal bond investments. The Company\u2019s investment policy only permits the purchase of investment-grade securities. The Company\u2019s investment portfolio totaled approximately $24 million as of December 31, 2017, or approximately 9% of total assets. If the value of municipal bonds in general or any of the Company\u2019s municipal bond holdings deteriorate, the performance of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s total assets include goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. If management determines these have become impaired in the future, net earnings could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, potential tax reform changes related to such assets may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are comprised of trademarks on certain of the Company\u2019s principal shoe brands. The Company\u2019s goodwill and trademarks totaled approximately $44 million as of December 31, 2017, or approximately 17% of total assets.\nThe Company analyzes its goodwill and trademarks for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when, in the judgment of management, an event has occurred that may indicate that additional analysis is required. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the Company\u2019s performance, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the products sold by the Company, and a variety of other factors. The amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed as a charge to results of operations in the period in which the asset becomes impaired.\nThe Company did not record any goodwill or trademark impairment charges following the 2017 and 2015 impairment tests. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company evaluated the current state of\nits Umi business and determined the brand did not fit the long-term strategic objectives of the Company. As a result, the Company recorded a $1.8 million impairment charge ($1.1 million after tax) to write off the majority of the value of the Umi trademark in 2016. Other than this write-off, the Company did not record any other goodwill or trademark impairment charges in 2016. Any future determination of impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill and trademarks are being deducted for tax purposes in accordance with the U.S. tax policy. Any changes in the U.S. tax policy, limiting or eliminating the deductibility of such assets, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nRisks related to our defined benefit plan may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Significant changes in actual investment return on defined benefit plan assets, discount rates, mortality assumptions and other factors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and the amounts of contributions the Company must make to its defined benefit plan in future periods. As the Company marks-to-market its defined benefit plan assets and liabilities on an annual basis, large non-cash gains or losses could be recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. require that the Company calculate income or expense for the plan using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. Funding requirements for the Company\u2019s defined benefit plans are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to defined benefit funding obligations. For a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to determine net periodic pension cost, refer to \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d included in Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nNatural disasters and other events outside of the Company\u2019s control, and the ineffective management of such events, may harm the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s facilities and operations, as well as those of the Company\u2019s suppliers and customers, may be impacted by natural disasters. In the event of such disasters, and if the Company or its suppliers or customers are not adequately insured, the Company\u2019s business could be harmed due to the event itself or due to its inability to effectively manage the effects of the particular event; potential harms include the loss of business continuity, the loss of inventory or business data and damage to infrastructure, warehouses or distribution centers.", "PERMNO": 38033, "SIC": 5130, "TIC": "WEYS"}
