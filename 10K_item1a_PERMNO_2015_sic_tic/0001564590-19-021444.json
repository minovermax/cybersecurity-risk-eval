Risk Factors.\nInvestment in our common stock involves a substantial degree of risk and should be regarded as speculative. As a result, the purchase of our common stock should be considered only by persons who can reasonably afford to lose their entire investment. Before you elect to purchase our common stock, you should carefully consider the risk and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information incorporated herein by reference. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or which we currently believe are immaterial could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the risks or uncertainties discussed in this Annual Report occur, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, in which case the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Development of In Vivo Therapeutic Tissue Candidates\nWe may not be successful in improving or demonstrating the durability and functionality of our in vivo liver tissue candidate.\nOur in vivo liver tissue is our lead therapeutic candidate. In May 2019, we announced our need to conduct additional preclinical studies and to optimize our manufacturing processes to generate decisive scientific data regarding the prolonged functionality and therapeutic benefits of our liver tissue candidate. The requirement to complete additional studies and to optimize our manufacturing processes resulted from data generated from a larger group of animal studies that differed from our earlier pilot studies. These studies continued to show statistically meaningful reductions in toxic globules in the A1AT animal models over a three-month period. However, in these and other animal models, we observed shorter tissue duration than we observed in our pilot studies, as measured by human protein output and the quantity of hepatocytes. In the near-term, we intend to focus our efforts on examining and optimizing our manufacturing processes, with the goal of improving the durability and functionality of our liver tissue candidate. We also plan to focus on conducting the confirmatory animal studies and scientific validations required to support moving forward with our clinical development efforts for our liver tissue candidate. There is no assurance that we will be successful in improving the durability or functionality of our liver tissue candidate or completing the necessary studies and scientific validations on a timely basis, or at all. If we fail to do so, we may not be able to generate the scientific and preclinical data necessary to support an investigational new drug (IND) submission with the FDA, and may be required to cease pursuing the development of our current liver tissue candidate. We may not have sufficient capital resources on-hand to engage in a lengthy redesign or redevelop our manufacturing processes or our liver tissue candidate or to complete the preclinical studies necessary to submit an IND for another tissue candidate. As a result, if we are not successful in improving and demonstrating the durability and functionality of our liver tissue candidate, our business, financial condition and liquidity may be harmed.\nThe development of new biopharmaceutical products involves a lengthy and complex process and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for any of the therapeutic products we are currently developing.\nWe are focusing the majority of our resources on the development of our liver tissue candidate. In addition to our liver tissue candidate, we have conducted initial research and development activities on several other tissue candidates. Each of our therapeutic tissue candidates are in the early stages of research and development and will require substantial financial resources, development, preclinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing scale-up and regulatory approval prior to being ready for sale. This process can take\nmany years of effort without any assurance of ultimate success. Our product development efforts with respect to a tissue candidate could be delayed or could fail for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nthe failure of the tissue candidate in preclinical or clinical studies, including failing to demonstrate sufficient durability and functionality to support further development activities; the inability to satisfy the regulatory requirements to successfully submit an IND with the FDA;\n\u2022\nadverse patient reactions to the tissue candidate or indications of other safety concerns;\n\u2022\ninsufficient clinical trial data to support the effectiveness or superiority of the tissue candidate;\n\u2022\nour inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of the tissue candidate for development, clinical, or commercialization activities in a timely and cost-efficient manner;\n\u2022\nour failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, the required regulatory approvals for the tissue candidate, the facilities or the process used to manufacture the tissue candidate;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment, including pricing and reimbursement, that make development of a new product or of an existing product for a new indication no longer attractive;\n\u2022\nthe failure to obtain or maintain satisfactory drug reimbursement rates by governmental or third-party payers; and\n\u2022\nthe development of a competitive product or therapy.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that the preclinical or clinical studies we perform for our tissue candidates will support the submission of an IND, or that any of our tissue candidates will receive regulatory approval. Even if a tissue candidate did receive the required regulatory approval, there can no assurance that we could provide for the effective marketing and sale of such product, either by ourselves or in partnership with others. Accordingly, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of drug development.\nPreclinical development is uncertain. Our preclinical programs may experience delays or may never advance to clinical trials, which would adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approvals or commercialize these programs on a timely basis or at all, which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nBefore we can commence clinical trials for our therapeutic candidates, we must complete extensive preclinical studies that support an IND submission in the United States, or similar applications in other jurisdictions. We cannot be certain of the timely completion or outcome of our preclinical studies and cannot predict if the FDA or other regulatory authorities will accept our proposed clinical programs or if the outcome of our preclinical studies will ultimately support the further development of our programs. As a result, we cannot be sure that we will be able to submit an IND, or similar application for any of our preclinical tissue candidates on the timelines we expect, if at all, and we cannot be sure that submission of an IND or similar application will result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities allowing clinical trials to begin.\nOur 3D bioprinted tissue candidates represent new therapeutic approaches that could result in heightened regulatory scrutiny, delays in clinical development or delays in or our inability to achieve regulatory approval or commercialization of our tissue candidates.\nOur future success is dependent on the successful development of 3D bioprinted tissue products in general and our liver candidate in particular. Because this program represents a new approach to treating liver disease, inborn errors of metabolism, and other diseases, developing and commercializing our liver tissue and other potential tissue candidates subject us to a number of challenges, including:\n\u2022\nobtaining regulatory approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities, which have limited experience with regulating the development and commercialization of 3D bioprinted human tissues;\n\u2022\ndeveloping and deploying consistent and reliable processes for manufacturing 3D bioprinted tissues for implantation into patients;\n\u2022\nutilizing these tissue candidates in combination with other therapies, which may increase the risk of adverse side effects;\n\u2022\ndeveloping processes for the safe administration of these tissues, including long-term follow-up for all patients who receive these tissue candidates;\n\u2022\nsourcing clinical and, if approved, commercial supplies for the materials used to manufacture and process these tissue candidates that are free from viruses and other pathogens that may increase the risk of adverse side effects;\n\u2022\ndeveloping a manufacturing process and distribution network that can provide a stable supply with a cost of goods that allows for an attractive return on investment;\n\u2022\nqualifying, engaging, and training clinical trial investigators and institutions who will be able to implement the institutionally-approved protocols, recruit and treat patients, and generate data in accordance with targeted goals and timelines;\n\u2022\nestablishing sales and marketing capabilities after obtaining any regulatory approval to gain market acceptance, and obtaining adequate coverage, reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities; and\n\u2022\ndeveloping therapies for types of diseases beyond those initially addressed by our current tissue candidates.\nThe regulatory approval process for novel tissue candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied product candidates. As we are developing novel treatments for diseases in which there is little clinical experience with new endpoints and methodologies, there is a heightened risk that the FDA, EMA, or comparable foreign regulatory bodies may not consider our proposed clinical trial endpoints to provide clinically meaningful results.\nFurther, we cannot be sure that the manufacturing processes used in connection with our 3D bioprinted tissue candidates will yield a sufficient supply of satisfactory products that are safe, effective, scalable, or profitable.\nMoreover, actual or perceived safety issues, including adoption of new therapeutics or novel approaches to treatment, may adversely influence the willingness of subjects to participate in clinical trials, or if approved, of physicians to subscribe to the novel treatment options.\nPhysicians, hospitals and third-party payors often are slow to adopt new products, technologies and treatment practices that require additional upfront costs and training. Physicians may not be willing to undergo training to adopt this novel therapy, may decide the therapy is too complex to adopt without appropriate training and may choose not to administer the therapy. Based on these and other factors, hospitals and payors may decide that the benefits of this new therapy do not or will not outweigh its costs.\nWe have not yet tested any bioprinted therapeutic tissue candidates in clinical trials. Success in early preclinical studies may not be indicative of results obtained in later preclinical studies. Similarly, results from early clinical trials may not be indicative of results obtained in later clinical trials.\nOur tissue candidates involve novel technologies and have never been evaluated in clinical trials. It is unknown how translatable the preclinical animal models used in our preclinical studies are to humans. We will be required to demonstrate through adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that our tissue candidates are safe and effective, with a favorable risk-benefit profile, for use in their target indications before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Initial positive results we have observed for our tissue candidates in preclinical animal models may not be predictive of results from our later preclinical trial results, nor of results from future clinical trials in humans. For example, in May 2019, we announced that data generated from a larger group of animal studies differed from our earlier pilot studies and put into question the durability and functionality of our liver tissue candidate. Our products may also fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in later stages of development even if they successfully advance through initial clinical trials.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct certain aspects of our preclinical studies and to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines or comply with legal and regulatory requirements, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of or commercialize any potential tissue candidates.\nWe depend upon third parties to conduct certain aspects of our preclinical studies and will depend on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, under agreements with universities, medical institutions, CROs, strategic partners and others. This requires us to negotiate budgets and contracts with such third parties, and if we are unsuccessful or if the negotiations take longer than anticipated, this could result in delays to our development timelines and increased costs.\nWe will rely especially heavily on third parties over the course of our clinical trials, and, as a result, will have limited control over the clinical investigators and limited visibility into their day-to-day activities, including with respect to their compliance with the approved clinical protocol. Nevertheless, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal and regulatory requirements and scientific standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and these third parties are required to comply with GCP requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for tissue candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable GCP requirements, the clinical data\ngenerated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to suspend or terminate these trials or perform additional preclinical studies or clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot be certain that, upon inspection, such regulatory authorities will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with the GCP requirements. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with biologic product produced under cGMP requirements and may require a large number of patients.\nOur failure or any failure by these third parties to comply with these regulations or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws.\nAny third parties conducting aspects of our preclinical studies or clinical trials will not be our employees and, except for remedies that may be available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our preclinical studies and clinical trials. These third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue conducting clinical trials for our tissue candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Some of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for tissue candidates that treat the same indications as our tissue candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 tissue candidates. Patient enrollment is affected by other factors including:\n\u2022\nthe size and nature of the patient population;\n\u2022\nthe severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\nthe eligibility criteria for, and design of, the clinical trial in question, including factors such as frequency of required assessments, length of the study, and ongoing monitoring requirements;\n\u2022\nthe perceived risks and benefits of the tissue candidate under study, including the potential advantages or disadvantages of the tissue candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies;\n\u2022\ncompetition in recruiting and enrolling patients in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain or maintain patient informed consents;\n\u2022\nrisk that enrolled patients will drop out before completion;\n\u2022\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u2022\nthe proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nEnrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our tissue candidates, or the inability to complete development of our tissue candidates, which would cause the value of our company to decline, limit our ability to obtain additional financing, and materially impair our ability to generate revenues.\nOur experience manufacturing NovoTissues is limited. Manufacturing issues, including technical or quality issues or issues, may arise that could cause delays in our development programs or increase costs. Furthermore, we may experience delays in regulatory approval of our tissue candidates if we do not satisfy applicable manufacturing regulatory requirements.\nBefore we may initiate a clinical trial or commercialize any of our tissue candidates, we must demonstrate to the FDA that the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for our tissue products meet applicable requirements. Because no bioprinted tissue product has been approved in the United States, there is no manufacturing facility that has demonstrated the ability to comply with FDA requirements, and therefore the timeframe and requirements for demonstrating compliance to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction is uncertain.\nBioprinted tissue manufacturing is a nascent industry. To our knowledge, there are no contract manufacturing organizations (CMO) with experience in manufacturing bioprinted tissue products under GMP conditions. We conduct all of our manufacturing internally.\nWe have been conducting all of our research to date in research facilities and are in the process of implementing applicable FDA manufacturing requirements. However, we have limited experience as a company in developing a manufacturing facility that meets all applicable GMP requirements, and we may never be successful in developing our own manufacturing facility.\nManufacturing our therapeutic tissue candidates may be complicated or present novel technical challenges. We may encounter problems achieving adequate quantities and quality of clinical-grade materials to conduct our clinical trials, or to meet FDA, EMA or other applicable standards or specifications with consistent and acceptable production yields and costs.\nTo date, we have not yet scaled up the manufacturing process for NovoTissues Liver beyond the scale used for research and nonclinical studies. The time and efforts required for us to develop and validate our manufacturing process to support clinical use may delay or impair our ability to develop this program in accordance with our expected timelines.\nIn order to manufacture and supply any of our tissue candidates on a commercial scale in the future, we will need to bolster our quality control and quality assurance capabilities, including by augmenting our manufacturing processes and adding personnel. We also may encounter problems hiring and retaining the experienced specialist scientific and manufacturing personnel needed to operate our manufacturing process, which could result in delays in our production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. As we engage in scale-up manufacturing of any approved product, we may encounter unexpected issues relating to the manufacturing processes, donor variability, or the quality, purity or stability of the product, and we may be required to refine or alter our manufacturing processes to address these issues. Resolving these issues could result in significant delays and may result in significantly increased costs. If we underestimate the demand for an approved product, given the long lead times required to manufacture or obtain regulatory approvals for our products, we could potentially face commercial drug product supply shortages. If we experience significant delays or other obstacles in producing any approved product at commercial scale, our ability to market and sell any approved products may be adversely affected and our business could suffer.\nWe may in the future wish to engage contract manufacturers to conduct some or all of our clinical and/or commercial manufacturing. We believe that the high demand for and scarcity of potential contract manufacturers may cause long lead times for establishing contract manufacturing capabilities for our bioprinted tissue products.\nIt is often the case that early stage research is conducted with materials that are not manufactured using GMP starting materials, techniques or processes and which are not subject to the same level of analysis that would be required for clinical grade material. We may encounter difficulties in translating the manufacturing processes used to produce research grade materials to GMP compliant processes, and any changes in the manufacturing process may affect the safety and efficacy profile of our tissue candidates. In order to progress the development of our NovoTissues Liver candidate or any other engineered tissue candidate, we will need to devote significant time and financial resources to establishing manufacturing processes that are sufficient for IND-enabling preclinical toxicology studies as well as clinical supplies. In addition, because early stage, pilot manufacturing is often done on a small scale, we may face challenges scaling up any early stage manufacturing to the scale necessary to support supply for clinical trials. If we are not able to establish manufacturing or related processes in a manner required for further development of our tissue candidates, our development plans may be delayed or stalled, and our business may be materially harmed.\nAny problems in our manufacturing process could make us a less attractive collaborator for potential partners, including larger pharmaceutical companies and academic research institutions, which could limit our access to additional attractive development programs.\nOur tissue candidates are novel, complex, and difficult to manufacture. We could experience manufacturing problems that result in delays in our development or commercialization programs or otherwise harm our business.\nThe manufacturing processes used to produce our tissue candidates are complex, novel, and have not been validated for commercial use. Several factors could cause production interruptions, including equipment malfunctions, facility contamination, raw material shortages or contamination, natural disasters, disruption in utility services, human error, or disruptions in the operations of our suppliers.\nOur tissue candidates require processing and manufacturing steps that are more complex than those required for manufacturing most small molecule drugs. Unlike small molecules, the physical and chemical properties of our tissue candidates are challenging to fully characterize, and the products may be manufactured \u201cjust in time\u201d to be implanted, which limits the timeframe for conducting release testing on the finished product. As a result, assays of the finished product may not be sufficient to ensure that the product is consistent from lot-to-lot or will perform in the intended manner. We are in the process of developing our in-process controls to assure that the manufacturing process works reproducibly. If we are unable to develop and validate these manufacturing controls, our development\nplans may be delayed or stalled, and our business may be materially harmed. If we do not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we announce and expect, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nFrom time to time, we estimate the timing and accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory, manufacturing, and other product development goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials and the submissions of regulatory filings. From time to time, we may publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones. All of these milestones are, and will be, based on a variety of assumptions. The actual timing of these milestones can vary significantly as compared with our estimates, in some cases for reasons beyond our control. If we do not meet milestones that we have publicly announced, the commercialization of our tissue candidates may be delayed, and as a result, our stock price may be negatively impacted.\nDevelopment of combination tissue candidates may present more or different challenges than development of a single-agent product candidate.\nFDA may designate our liver tissue candidate a combination product, and development of combination product candidates may present more or different challenges than development of a single-agent product candidate. A combination therapy is a single therapeutic product that consists of two or more active ingredients, with each component making a contribution to the claimed effect of the drug. The development of combination drugs may be more complex than the development of single agent products. This requirement may make the design and conduct of clinical trials more complex, requiring more clinical trial subjects. We also may not be able to meet the FDA's approval standards required for combination products. Finally, the FDA's requirements concerning combination products may change in the future. Moreover, the applicable requirements for approval may differ from country to country.\nWe may never obtain FDA approval for any of our tissue candidates in the United States, and even if we do, we may never obtain approval for or commercialize any of our tissue candidates in any other jurisdictions, which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential.\nIn order to eventually market any of our tissue candidates in any particular foreign jurisdiction, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis regarding safety and efficacy. Approval by the FDA in the United States, if obtained, does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions. In addition, clinical trials conducted in one country many not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in additional costs and require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. We do not have any therapeutic products approved for sale in any jurisdiction, including international markets, and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval in international markets, our target market would be limited and our ability to achieve the full market potential of our products will be unrealized.\nWe obtain our clinical grade livers from a single source, and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities of clinical grade livers to support our clinical trials and/or commercialization.\nOur liver tissue candidate is manufactured using human primary liver cells from non-transplantable livers we receive from IIAM. We currently rely upon this single source to obtain the clinical grade non-transplantable livers that serve as the starting materials for manufacturing the liver cells we intend to use in our NovoTissues Liver product. The availability and quality of clinical grade livers may be sporadic and unpredictable. We have begun receiving clinical grade livers for use in our preclinical development program and intend to begin developing our inventory of cells for use in our preclinical and clinical trials. However, if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities and qualities of clinical grade livers to supply our clinical program or meet commercial demand, our development plans may be delayed or stalled, and our business may be materially harmed.\nOur liver tissue candidate includes primary cells from two donors. If the FDA does not authorize us to include cells from more than one donor, this may delay our development timeline.\nOur NovoTissues Liver product is manufactured using cells from a liver donor and cells from an umbilical cord donor. Under 21 CFR \u00a71271, cells from more than one donor cannot be combined in the manufacturing process absent a waiver from the FDA. We applied to FDA for a waiver authorizing us to include cells from two donors in manufacturing our NovoTissues Liver for clinical trials. If\nFDA does not grant the waiver, we will be required to redesign our NovoTissues Liver product. This could result in additional development costs and a delay in our development timeline, in which case our business may be materially harmed.\nAny contamination in our manufacturing facility, shortage of raw materials or reagents, or failure of any of our key suppliers to deliver necessary materials could result in delays in our clinical development.\nGiven the nature of manufacturing engineered tissue products, there is a risk of contamination. Any contamination could materially adversely affect our ability to produce our tissue candidates on schedule and could therefore harm our results of operations and cause reputational damage.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular tissue candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on tissue candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we have focused our development program on our liver tissue candidate. As a result, we may forego, limit, or delay pursuit of opportunities relating to other tissue candidates or indications that may later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to timely capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and tissue candidates for specific indications may not yield commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular tissue candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product.\nWe may not enjoy the market exclusivity benefits of our orphan drug designation.\nAlthough we may obtain orphan designations in the treatment of certain diseases our therapeutic products are intended to treat, the designation may not be applicable to any particular product we might get approved and that product may not be the first product to receive approval for that indication. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the first product with an orphan drug designation receives market exclusivity, which prohibits the FDA from approving the \u201csame\u201d drug for the same indication. The FDA has stated that drugs can be the \u201csame\u201d even when they are not identical but has not provided guidance with respect to how it will determine \u201csameness\u201d in the context of 3D bioprinted tissues. It is possible that another bioprinted therapeutic tissue product could be approved for the treatment of a disease one of our orphan products is intended to treat before our product is approved, which means that we may not obtain orphan drug exclusivity and could also potentially be blocked from approval until the first product\u2019s orphan drug exclusivity for a product expires or we demonstrate, if we can, that our product is superior. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved and granted orphan drug exclusivity, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.\nIt is possible that a competitor may achieve regulatory approval before we do or develop therapies that are more advanced or effective than ours, which may harm our business and financial condition, and our ability to successfully market or commercialize our tissue candidates.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the fields of gene therapies, cellular therapies, and engineered tissue products, are characterized by rapid technological progress, competition, and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We are aware of several companies focused on developing gene therapies and cellular therapies for use in treating end stage liver disease and/or inborn errors of metabolism. We may also face competition from large or specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, government agencies, and public and private research institutions.\nSome of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have greater financial, technical and other resources than we do, such as larger research and development, clinical, marketing and manufacturing organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in these industries may result in even greater concentration of resources among a smaller number of competitors. Competitors may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market, if ever. New or advanced technologies may render our current or future tissue candidates uneconomical or obsolete. Our competitors could develop products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less side effects, or are more convenient or less expensive than any tissue candidates that we may develop.\nRelated to Our Financial Position\nWe have a history of operating losses and expect to incur significant additional operating losses.\nWe have generated operating losses each year since we began operations, including $27.3 million and $35.3 million for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of March 31, 2019, we had incurred cumulative operating losses of $208.4 million and cumulative net losses totaling $260.8 million. We expect to incur substantial additional operating losses over the next several years as we continue our research and development efforts. To achieve profitability, we must either generate sufficient revenue through our in vitro tissues business to offset the costs of operating our business, or we must successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our therapeutic candidates and effectively market and sell any products we develop. Even if we are successful in commercializing a therapeutic product that receives regulatory approval, we may not be able to realize revenues at a level that would allow us to achieve or sustain profitability. We may therefore never generate significant revenue, and even if we do generate significant revenue, we may never achieve profitability.\nWe will require additional capital resources to develop and seek regulatory approval for our tissue candidates and to implement our business plan.\nWe are currently focusing our research and development efforts on examining and optimizing our manufacturing processes for our liver tissue candidate, with the goal of improving its durability and functionality. There is no assurance that we will be successful in improving the durability or functionality of our liver tissue candidate or completing the necessary studies and scientific validations on a timely basis, or at all. We may not have sufficient capital resources on-hand to engage in a lengthy redesign or redevelop our manufacturing processes or our liver tissue candidate or to complete the preclinical studies necessary to submit an IND for another tissue candidate. Further, even if we are successful in enhancing the durability and functionality of our liver tissue candidate, we will require additional capital resources in order to complete our planned and future preclinical and clinical development activities and to seek regulatory approval for our liver tissue candidate and any other tissue candidates we elect to pursue. We intend to cover our future operating expenses through cash on hand, the issuance of additional equity or debt securities, and from revenue derived from research service agreements, product sales, grants, and collaborative research agreements. Depending on market conditions, we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available when needed or that, if available, financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders. Having insufficient funds may require us to delay, scale back, or eliminate some or all of our development programs, relinquish rights to our technology, or pursue a strategic transaction on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose. Failure to obtain adequate financing could eventually adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern. If we raise additional funds from the issuance of equity securities, substantial dilution to our existing stockholders would likely result. If we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business.\nWe may not be able to correctly estimate our future capital requirements or revenues, which could lead to cash shortfalls, and require us to secure additional financing sooner than planned.\nWe expect that our spending levels will increase in connection with the preclinical and clinical trials required to support the development of our lead tissue candidate and any other therapeutic tissues we seek to advance toward commercialization. Our future operating expenses, however, will vary depending on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with the scope, progress and results of discovery, preclinical development, process development, and clinical trials for our therapeutic tissue candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with the development of our internal manufacturing facility and processes, including transitioning to GTP and subsequently GMP manufacturing;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we are able to secure collaborations or partnerships with third parties in order to further support the development of our therapeutic tissue candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs and fees associated with the discovery, acquisition or in-license of tissue candidates or technologies; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of revenues received from commercial sales of our in vitro products and services.\nIn addition, we may not correctly predict the amount or timing of future revenues. As a result, the timing and amount of our capital requirements may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nour expectations regarding revenues from sales of our products and services, and from collaborations with third parties;\n\u2022\ndelays in our anticipated timing to complete preclinical and clinical studies and obtaining required regulatory approvals for the therapeutic tissue candidates we elect to pursue;\n\u2022\nthe cost and time to pursue additional research and development programs as part of our long-term business plan;\n\u2022\nthe cost and time required to create effective sales and marketing capabilities and commercialization strategies;\n\u2022\nthe expenses we incur to maintain and improve our platform technology;\n\u2022\nthe costs to attract and retain personnel with the skills required for effective operations; and\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation.\nIn addition, our budgeted expense levels are based in part on our expectations concerning future revenues from sales of our products and services, and from collaborations with third parties. However, we may not correctly predict the amount or timing of future revenues. In addition, we may not correctly estimate the costs and time required to develop, complete preclinical and clinical studies and obtain regulatory approval for our therapeutic tissue candidates. We may not be able to adjust our operations in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in our revenues or any increase in our expenses as part of implementing our long-term business plan. As a result, a significant shortfall in our planned revenues or a significant increase in our planned expenses could have an immediate and material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In such case, we may be required to issue additional equity or debt securities or enter into other commercial arrangements, including relationships with corporate and other partners, sooner than anticipated to secure the additional financial resources to support our development efforts and future operations.\nOur quarterly operating results may vary, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by such factors as:\n\u2022\nthe results of our development and regulatory approval progress for our therapeutic tissue candidates;\n\u2022\nour reported revenues and financial results;\n\u2022\nthe commencement, postponement, delay, progress, completion, or cancellation of client contracts or collaborations in the quarter;\n\u2022\nchanges in the mix of our products and services;\n\u2022\nchanges in the general global economy\n\u2022\ncompetitive pricing pressures;\n\u2022\nthe extent of cost overruns or delays in our product development and regulatory approval plans;\n\u2022\nholiday buying patterns of our clients;\n\u2022\nbudget cycles of our clients;\nWe believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results. Nonetheless, fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur business will be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully attract, hire and integrate key additional employees or if we are unable to retain our executive officers and other key personnel.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to attract, hire, and integrate key medical, clinical, scientific, technical, and managerial personnel required to develop our business. Our success will also depend to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key personnel, especially our executive officers. We do not currently have long-term employment agreements with our executive officers or our other key personnel, and there is no guarantee that our executive officers or key personnel will remain employed with us. Moreover, we have not obtained key man life insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death, disability or incapacity of any of our executive officers or other key personnel. Further, the process of attracting and retaining suitable replacements for any executive officers and other key personnel we lose in the future would result in transition costs and would divert the attention of other members of our senior management from our existing operations. Additionally, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets. As a result, the loss of any of our executive officers or other key personnel or our inability to timely attract and hire qualified personnel in the future (in particular skilled technical, managerial and sales and marketing personnel) will adversely impact our ability to meet our key commercial and technical goals and successfully implement our business plan.\nWe may be subject to security breaches or other cybersecurity incidents that could compromise our information and expose us to liability.\nWe routinely collect and store sensitive data (such as intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information) for the Company, its employees and its suppliers and customers. We make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our computer systems and networks and to protect this information. However, like other companies in our industry, our networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or intrusions, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, foreign companies or competitors, or may be breached by employee error, malfeasance or other disruption. Any such breach could result in unauthorized access to (or disclosure of) sensitive, proprietary or confidential information of ours, our employees or our suppliers or customers, and/or loss or damage to our data. Any such unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss of information could cause competitive harms, result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and/or cause reputational harm.\nIf our laboratory facilities become inoperable, we will lose access to our 3D bioprinters and tissues, and our ability to conduct our business and comply with our contractual obligations will be harmed.\nWe manufacture our NovoGen Bioprinters\u00ae and our 3D Human Liver Tissues at our laboratory facilities in San Diego, California. We also provide research services to our customers and collaboration partners and conduct our product research and development activities at our laboratory facilities in San Diego, California. We do not currently have redundant laboratory facilities. Our San Diego, California laboratory facilities are situated near active earthquake fault lines. Our facilities may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or manmade disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, fires, power outages and contamination, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to continue to provide our products and services and engage in our research and development activities for some period of time. Even if our facilities are inoperable for a short period of time, we may suffer the loss of our existing tissue and cell inventory, and the loss of any research services and activities currently in process. Accordingly, any disruption to operations at our laboratory facilities in San Diego, California would materially affect our business, prospects and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the United States.\nWe do business with customers outside the United States. We intend to continue to pursue customers and growth opportunities in international markets, and we expect that international revenues may account for a significant percentage of our revenues in the foreseeable future. There are a number of risks arising from our international business, including those related to:\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations, potentially reducing the United States dollars we receive for sales denominated in foreign currency;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions in the markets we operate in;\n\u2022\npotential increased costs associated with overlapping tax structures;\n\u2022\npotential trade restrictions and exchange controls;\n\u2022\nmore limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe difficulties of compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries, whether due to cultural differences, exchange rate fluctuation or other factors.\nThese risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For example, we are subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and Liquidity Risks\nWe could fail to maintain the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq, which could seriously harm the liquidity of our stock and our ability to raise capital or complete a strategic transaction.\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market has established continued listing requirements, including a requirement to maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least $1 per share. If a company trades for 30 consecutive business days below such minimum closing bid price, it will receive a deficiency notice from Nasdaq. Assuming it is in compliance with the other continued listing requirements, Nasdaq would provide such company a period of 180 calendar days in which to regain compliance by maintaining a closing bid price at least $1 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days.\nAs of the date of this filing, our common stock is trading below $1 per share. If the closing bid price of our common stock continues trading below $1 per share for an aggregate of 30 consecutive business days, we will receive a deficiency notice from Nasdaq. If, in such circumstance, we are not able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement within 180 days, our common stock will be subject to a delisting action by Nasdaq. If we are unable to cure the deficiency or regain compliance, our common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and begin trading on the OTC bulletin board.\nA delisting from Nasdaq and commencement of trading on the OTC bulletin board would likely result in a reduction in some or all of the following, each of which could have a material adverse effect on stockholders:\n\u2022\nthe liquidity of our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe market price of shares of our common stock (and the accompanying valuation of our company);\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financing or complete a strategic transaction;\n\u2022\nthe number of institutional and other investors that will consider investing in shares of our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe number of market markers or broker-dealers for our common stock; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of shares of our common stock.\nWe have a limited trading history and there is no assurance that an active market in our common stock will continue at present levels or increase in the future.\nThere is limited trading history in our common stock, and although our common stock is now traded on the Nasdaq Global Market, there is no assurance that an active market in our common stock will continue at present levels or increase in the future. As a result, an investor may find it difficult to dispose of our common stock on the timeline and at the volumes they desire. This factor limits the liquidity of our common stock and may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and on our ability to raise additional capital.\nCompliance with the reporting requirements of federal securities laws can be expensive.\nWe are a public reporting company in the United States, and accordingly, subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and other federal securities laws, including the compliance obligations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The costs of complying with the reporting requirements of the federal securities laws, including preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders, can be substantial.\nIf we fail to comply with the rules of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to accounting controls and procedures, or, if we discover material weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, we may be subject to sanctions by regulatory authorities and our stock price could decline.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and requires an attestation and report by our external auditing firm on our internal control over financial reporting. We believe our system and process evaluation and testing comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of Section 404. We cannot be certain, however, that we will be able to satisfy the requirements in Section 404 in all future periods, especially as we grow our business. If we are not able to continue to meet the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or Nasdaq. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results or investors\u2019 confidence in us and could cause our stock price to fall. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we may be required to incur significant additional financial and management resources to achieve compliance.\nThe price of our common stock may continue to be volatile, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate in response to factors such as:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements of developments by us or our competitors, including new product and service offerings;\n\u2022\nresults of our preclinical studies and regulatory actions regarding our therapeutic products;\n\u2022\nreduced government funding for research and development activities;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nadoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock or other securities in the open market;\n\u2022\ndegree of coverage of securities analysts and reports and recommendations issued by securities analysts regarding our business;\n\u2022\nvolume fluctuations in the trading of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such a company. Litigation initiated against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business and financial condition.\nInvestors may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our capital stock.\nWe are authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of common stock and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of March 31, 2019, there were an aggregate of 153,092,560 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding on a fully diluted basis and no shares of preferred stock outstanding. That total for our common stock includes 27,743,413 shares of our common stock that may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or is available for issuance under our equity incentive plans, 1,188,718 shares of common stock that may be issued through our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d), and 145,000 shares of our common stock that may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding warrants.\nIn the future, we may issue additional authorized but previously unissued equity securities to raise funds to support our continued operations and to implement our business plan. We may also issue additional shares of our capital stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our capital stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, or for other business purposes. If we raise additional funds from the issuance of equity securities, substantial dilution to our existing stockholders may result. In addition, the future issuance of any such additional shares of capital stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with any capital raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of our common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Global Market. Moreover, depending on market conditions, we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available when needed or that, if available, financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have paid no dividends on our common stock to date and it is not anticipated that any dividends will be paid to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. While our future dividend policy will be based on the operating results and capital needs of our business, it is currently anticipated that any earnings will be retained to finance our future expansion and for the implementation of our business plan. As an investor, you should take note of the fact that a lack of a dividend can further affect the market value of our stock and could significantly affect the value of any investment.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our Board of Directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued by the Board of Directors without prior stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of the common stock;\n\u2022\nprovide for a classified Board of Directors, with each director serving a staggered three-year term;\n\u2022\nprohibit our stockholders from filling board vacancies, calling special stockholder meetings, or taking action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nrequire advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our Board of Directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current Board of Directors, including delaying or impeding a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our Board of Directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to our In Vitro Tissues Business\nOur In Vitro Tissues Business Depends on New and Unproven Technology and Approaches\nOur in vitro products and services involve new and unproven models and approaches. We began offering our first commercial product (and related research services), our ExVive\u2122 Human Liver Tissue, on a limited basis in April 2014 and more broadly in November 2014. We began offering our second product (and related research services), our ExVive\u2122 Human Kidney Tissue, for predictive preclinical testing of drug compounds in September 2016. Our commercial products reflect a novel approach to preclinical testing of drug compounds and disease modeling, and there is no assurance that they will perform as expected or as required by our customers. Our success depends on the commercial acceptance of, and the success of our efforts to increase customer awareness and demand for, our drug discovery and biological research tools, products and services. Some of our customers may require unique features, cell sourcing, validation data, or greater degrees of reproducibility than we have been able to achieve to date, in order to utilize our commercial products in their drug discovery, biological research or development programs. Even if we or our customers are successful in our respective efforts, we or our customers may not be able to discover or develop commercially viable therapeutics or other products therefrom. If our drug discovery and biological research tools do not assist in the discovery and development of such therapeutic products or to model diseases, our current and potential customers may lose confidence in our in vitro products and services, and our ability to achieve or maintain commercial acceptance for those products and services may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our In Vitro products and services is subject to a variety of risks.\nThe commercialization of our in vitro products and services is subject to risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nfailing to develop products or services that are effective, reproducible, and competitive;\n\u2022\nfailing to demonstrate the commercial and technical viability of any products or services that we successfully develop, failing to meet customer expectations or requirements or otherwise failing to achieve market acceptance of such products or services;\n\u2022\nfailing to be cost effective and timely;\n\u2022\nbeing unable to implement features or functionality required by customers;\n\u2022\nbeing difficult or impossible to manufacture on a large scale;\n\u2022\nbeing unable to establish and maintain supply and manufacturing relationships with reliable third parties;\n\u2022\nbeing unable to obtain a sufficient supply of human cells for our products, services and research and development activities on a timely basis and at acceptable quality levels and costs;\n\u2022\nfailing to develop our products and services before the successful marketing of similar products and services by competitors;\n\u2022\nbeing unable to hire and retain qualified personnel; and\n\u2022\ninfringing the proprietary rights of third parties or competing with superior products marketed by third parties.\nIf any of these or any other risks and uncertainties occur, our efforts to commercialize our in vitro products and services may be unsuccessful, which would harm our business and results of operations.\nThe near and long-term viability of our products and services will depend on our ability to successfully establish new strategic relationships.\nThe near and long-term viability of our products and services will depend in part on our ability to successfully establish new strategic collaborations with biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, universities, hospitals, insurance companies and government agencies. Establishing strategic collaborations is difficult and time-consuming. Potential collaborators may reject collaborations based upon their assessment of our technology or product offerings or our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position. If we fail to establish a sufficient number of new collaborations on acceptable terms, we may not be able to commercialize our products or generate sufficient revenue to fund further research and development efforts. Even if we establish new collaborations, these relationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of any product or service candidates for several reasons both within and outside of our control.\nWe face intense competition which could result in reduced acceptance and demand for our products and services.\nThe biotechnology industry is subject to intense competition and rapid and significant technological change. We have many potential competitors, including major drug companies, specialized biotechnology firms, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial and technical resources, experience and expertise in the following areas than we do:\n\u2022\nresearch and technology development;\n\u2022\nproduct identification and development;\n\u2022\nregulatory processes and approvals;\n\u2022\nproduction and manufacturing;\n\u2022\nsecuring government contracts and grants to support their research and development efforts;\n\u2022\nsales and marketing of products, services and technologies; and\n\u2022\nidentifying and entering into agreements with potential collaborators.\nPrincipal competitive factors in our industry include the quality, scientific and technical support, price and breadth of technology and services; management and the execution of product development and commercialization strategies; skill and experience of employees, including the ability to recruit and retain skilled, experienced employees; intellectual property portfolio; range of capabilities, including product identification, development, regulatory approval, manufacturing and marketing; and the availability of substantial capital resources to fund these activities.\nIn order to effectively compete, we will need to make substantial investments in our research and technology development, product identification and development, testing and regulatory approval, manufacturing, customer awareness activities, publications of our technology and results in scientific publications and sales and marketing activities. There is no assurance that we will be successful in commercializing and gaining significant market share for any products or services we offer in part through use of our technology. Our technologies, products and services also may be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive as a result of products and services introduced by our competitors.\nWe will require access to a constant, steady, reliable supply of human cells to successfully develop and commercialize our in vitro products and services.\nWe require a reliable supply of qualified human cells for our commercial products and services and for our research and product development activities. We purchase certain qualified human cells from selected third-party suppliers based on quality assurance, cost effectiveness, and regulatory requirements. We formed our wholly-owned subsidiary, Samsara, to eventually serve as a key source of the primary human cells we utilize in our business. We intend to utilize a combination of third-party suppliers and Samsara to meet our overall future demand for human cells for our in vitro business. We work closely with Samsara and our third-party suppliers to\nassure adequate supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. If demand for our products and services grows significantly, we may need to identify additional sources of qualified human cells and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to access the quantity and quality of raw materials needed at a cost-effective price. Any failure to obtain a reliable supply of sufficient human cells or a supply at cost effective prices will harm our business and our results of operations and could cause us to be unable to comply with the contractual obligations we owe to our customers and collaboration partners.\nWe may not be successful in establishing Samsara as a profitable commercial business.\nIn January 2016, we announced that our wholly-owned subsidiary, Samsara, commenced commercial operations. We formed Samsara to serve as a key source of certain of the primary human cells we utilize in our products and services and in the development of therapeutic products. In addition to supplying human cells for our business requirements, we believe there is an opportunity for Samsara to operate as a commercial business by selling human cells to other pharmaceutical, biotech and research organizations. Samsara has begun selling its human cell offerings to end users both directly and through distribution partners. Operating and developing Samsara\u2019s business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nfailing to source a sufficient supply of high-quality human organs or cells;\n\u2022\nfailing to achieve market acceptance for its human cell offerings;\n\u2022\nfailing to demonstrate the quality and reliability of its human cell offerings;\n\u2022\nfailing to be both cost effective and competitive with the products offered by third parties;\n\u2022\nfailing to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nfailing to be able to produce its human cell offerings on a large enough scale;\n\u2022\nfailing to establish and maintain distribution relationships with reliable third parties;\n\u2022\nfailing to hire and retain qualified personnel; and\n\u2022\ninfringing the proprietary rights of third parties.\nIf any of these or any other risks and uncertainties occur, our efforts to establish Samsara as a commercial business may be unsuccessful, which would harm our business and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our sales will be dependent upon our customers\u2019 capital spending policies and research and development budgets, and government funding of research and development programs at universities and other organizations, which are each subject to significant and unexpected decrease.\nOur prospective customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government laboratories, and private research foundations. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, patent expirations, mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, spending priorities, general economic conditions, and institutional and governmental budgetary policies, including but not limited to reductions in grants for research by federal and state agencies as a result of the current budget crises and budget reduction measures. In addition, our business could be seriously damaged by any significant decrease in life sciences research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government laboratories, or private foundations.\nThe timing and amount of revenues from customers that rely on government funding of research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast. Research funding for life science research has increased more slowly during the past several years compared to the previous years and has declined in some countries, and some grants have been frozen for extended periods of time or otherwise become unavailable to various institutions, sometimes without advance notice. Government funding of research and development is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Other programs, such as homeland security or defense, or general efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit could be viewed by the United States government as a higher priority. These budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations to government agencies that fund research and development activities. National Institute of Health and other research and development allocations have been diminished in recent years by federal budget control efforts. The prolonged or increased shift away from the funding of life sciences research and development or delays surrounding the approval of government budget proposals may cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products or services, which could seriously damage our business.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nViolation of government regulations or quality programs could harm demand for our products or services, and the evolving nature of government regulations could have an adverse impact on our business.\nTo the extent that our collaborators or customers use our products in the manufacturing or testing processes for their drug and medical device products, such end-products or services may be regulated by the FDA under Quality System Regulations (QSR) or the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA\u201988) regulations. The customer is ultimately responsible for QSR, CLIA\u201988 and other compliance requirements for their products. However, we may agree to comply with certain requirements, and, if we fail to do so, we could lose sales and our collaborators or customers and be exposed to regulatory delays or objections and potential product liability claims. In addition, our customers may require that our services be conducted pursuant to the requirements of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) in order to provide suitable data for their INDs and other regulatory filings. No regulatory review of data from our platform technology has yet been conducted and there is no guarantee that our technology will be acceptable under GLP, or that we will be able to comply with GLP requirements on the timetable required by our customers. As a result, the violation of government regulations or failure to comply with quality requirements could harm demand for our products or services, and the evolving nature of government regulations could have an adverse impact on our business.\nAny therapeutic tissues we develop will be subject to extensive, lengthy and uncertain regulatory requirements, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner, or at all.\nAny therapeutic and other life science products we develop, including our therapeutic human liver tissue, will be subject to extensive, lengthy and uncertain regulatory approval process by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and comparable agencies in other countries. The regulation of new products is extensive, and the required process of laboratory testing and clinical studies is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. We may not be able to obtain FDA approvals for any therapeutic products we develop in a timely manner, or at all. We may encounter significant delays or excessive costs in our efforts to secure necessary approvals or licenses. Even if we obtain FDA regulatory approvals, the FDA extensively regulates manufacturing, labeling, distributing, marketing, promotion and advertising after product approval. Moreover, several of our product development areas may involve relatively new technologies and have not been the subject of extensive laboratory testing and clinical studies. The regulatory requirements governing these products and related clinical procedures remain uncertain and the products themselves may be subject to substantial review by the FDA and other foreign governmental regulatory authorities that could prevent or delay approval in the United States and any other foreign country. Regulatory requirements ultimately imposed on our products could limit our ability to test, manufacture and, ultimately, commercialize our products and thereby could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs we continue to adapt and develop parts of our product line in the future, including tissue-based products in the field of regenerative medicine, the manufacture and marketing of our products will become subject to government regulation in the United States and other countries. In the United States and most foreign countries, we will be required to complete rigorous preclinical testing and extensive human clinical trials that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product in order to apply for regulatory approval to market the product. The steps required by the FDA before our proposed products may be marketed in the United States include performance of preclinical (animal and laboratory) tests; submissions to the FDA of an IND, NDA (New Drug Application), or BLA (Biologic License Application) which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product in the intended target population; and performance of a consistent and reproducible manufacturing process intended for commercial use.\nThe processes are expensive and can take many years to complete, and we may not be able to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products to the satisfaction of such regulatory authorities. The start of clinical trials can be delayed or take longer than anticipated for many and varied reasons, many of which are outside of our control. Safety concerns may emerge that could lengthen the ongoing trials or require additional trials to be conducted. Regulatory authorities may also require additional testing, and we may be required to demonstrate that our proposed products represent an improved form of treatment over existing therapies, which we may be unable to do without conducting further clinical studies. Moreover, if the FDA grants regulatory approval of a product, the approval may be limited to specific indications or limited with respect to our distribution. Expanded or additional indications for approved devices or drugs may not be approved, which could limit our revenues. Foreign regulatory authorities may apply similar limitations or may refuse to grant any approval. Consequently, even if we believe that preclinical and clinical data are sufficient to support regulatory approval for our tissue candidates, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may not ultimately grant approval for commercial sale in any jurisdiction. If our products are not approved, our ability to generate revenues will be limited and our business will be adversely affected.\nEven if a product gains regulatory approval, such approval is likely to limit the indicated uses for which it may be marketed, and the product and the manufacturer of the product will be subject to continuing regulatory review, including adverse event reporting requirements and the FDA\u2019s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved uses. Failure to comply with any post-approval requirements can, among other things, result in warning letters, product seizures, recalls, substantial fines, injunctions, suspensions or revocations of marketing licenses, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. Any of these enforcement actions, any unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or the adoption of new requirements, or any safety issues that arise with\nany approved products, could adversely affect our ability to market products and generate revenues and thus adversely affect our ability to continue our business.\nWe also may be restricted or prohibited from marketing or manufacturing a product, even after obtaining product approval, if previously unknown problems with the product or our manufacturer are subsequently discovered, and we cannot provide assurance that newly discovered or developed safety issues will not arise following any regulatory approval. With the use of any treatment by a wide patient population, serious adverse events may occur from time to time that initially do not appear to relate to the treatment itself, and only if the specific event occurs with some regularity over a period of time does the treatment become suspect as having a causal relationship to the adverse event. Any safety issues could cause us to suspend or cease marketing of our approved products, possibly subject us to substantial liabilities, and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.\nIf restrictions on reimbursements and health care reform limit our or our collaborators\u2019 actual or potential financial returns on therapeutic products that we or they develop based on our platform technology, we may not be able to recover our research and development costs and our collaborators may reduce or terminate their collaborations with us.\nOur ability to recover our research and development costs and successfully commercialize any therapeutic products we develop and our collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully commercialize the therapeutic and other life science products they develop through the research tools or services that we provide them may depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate payments for these products will be available from government payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, including managed care organizations, and other third-party payers. These payers are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and services. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutic and other life science products, and coverage and adequate payments may not be available for these products.\nIn recent years, officials have made numerous proposals to change the health care system in the U.S. These proposals included measures to limit or eliminate payments for some medical procedures and treatments or subject the pricing of pharmaceuticals and other medical products to government control. Government and other third-party payers increasingly attempt to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of payments of newly approved health care products. In some cases, they may also refuse to provide any coverage of uses of approved products for disease indications other than those for which the FDA has granted marketing approval. Governments may adopt future legislative proposals and federal, state or private payers for healthcare goods and services may take action to limit their payments for goods and services. Any of these events could reduce the demand for our products and services by our collaboration partners, reduce the proceeds we receive from our arrangements with our collaboration partners based on future sales of their therapeutic products or limit our ability to recover our research and development costs and successfully commercialize any therapeutic products we develop.\nWe use hazardous chemicals, biological materials and infectious agents in our business. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.\nOur product manufacturing research and development, and testing activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals, biological materials and infectious disease agents. We cannot eliminate the risks of accidental contamination or the accidental spread or discharge of these materials, or any resulting injury from such an event. We may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials, and our liability may exceed our insurance coverage and our total assets. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials and specified waste products, as well as the discharge of pollutants into the environment and human health and safety matters. We are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, and the experimental use of animals. Our operations may require that environmental permits and approvals be issued by applicable government agencies. We also cannot accurately predict the extent of regulations that might result from any future legislative or administrative action. Any of these laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional expense or restrict our operations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur substantial costs, including civil or criminal fines and penalties, clean-up costs or capital expenditures for control equipment or operational changes necessary to achieve and maintain compliance.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights, our business could be harmed.\nOur commercial success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection for our technologies, intellectual property and products and service offerings in the United States and other countries. If we do not protect our intellectual property adequately, competitors may be able to use our technologies and gain a competitive advantage.\nTo protect our products and technologies, we and our collaborators and licensors must prosecute and maintain existing patents, obtain new patents and pursue other intellectual property protection. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our technologies or from developing competing products and technologies. Moreover, the patent positions of many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, we cannot guarantee that:\n\u2022\nany patent applications filed by us will issue as patents;\n\u2022\nthird parties will not challenge our proprietary rights, and if challenged that a court or an administrative board of a patent office will hold that our patents are valid and enforceable;\n\u2022\nthird parties will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies by inventing around our claims;\n\u2022\nany patents issued to us will cover our technology and products as ultimately developed;\n\u2022\nwe will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u2022\nthe patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business; or\n\u2022\nas issued patents expire, we will not lose some competitive advantage.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nCertain foreign jurisdictions have an absolute requirement of novelty that renders any public disclosure of an invention immediately fatal to patentability in such jurisdictions. Therefore, there is a risk that we may not be able to protect some of our intellectual property in the United States or abroad due to disclosures, which we may not be aware of, by our collaborators or licensors. Some foreign jurisdictions prohibit certain types of patent claims, such as \u201cmethod-of-treatment/use-type\u201d claims; thus, the scope of protection available to us in such jurisdictions is limited.\nMoreover, filing, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our potential products and technologies throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not sought or obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our future products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits or other proceedings to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our collaborators or licensors. Or, our licensors may breach or otherwise prematurely terminate the provisions of our license agreements with them. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims or lawsuits, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our collaborators or licensors is not valid or is unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, our licensors may retain certain rights to use technologies licensed by us for research purposes. Patent disputes can take years to resolve, can be very costly and can result in loss of rights, injunctions and substantial penalties. Moreover, patent disputes and related proceedings can distract management\u2019s attention and interfere with running the business.\nFurthermore, because of the potential for substantial discovery in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments which could harm our business.\nAs more companies file patents relating to bioprinters and bioprinted tissues, it is possible that patent claims relating to bioprinters or bioprinted human tissue may be asserted against us, and any such assertions could harm our business. Moreover, we may face claims from non-practicing entities, which have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may thus have no deterrent effect. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation and diversion of resources, cause product shipment or delays or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we are successful in defending such claims, infringement and other intellectual property litigation can be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and divert management\u2019s attention from our core business. Any of these events could harm our business significantly.\nOur current and future research, development and commercialization activities also must satisfy the obligations under our license agreements. Any disputes arising under our license agreements could be costly and distract our management from the conduct of our business. Moreover, premature termination of a license agreement could have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition to infringement claims against us, if third parties have prepared and filed patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d) to determine the priority of invention. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party.\nThird parties may also attempt to initiate reexamination, post grant review or inter partes review of our patents or those of our collaborators or licensors in the PTO. We may also become involved in similar opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office or similar offices in other jurisdictions regarding our intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and potential products, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign their inventions to us. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for these breaches. Alternatively, if a third party alleges that any of our employees or consultants has breached confidentiality obligations to our benefit, we may have to defend against allegations of trade secret misappropriation.\nEnforcing or defending a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Further, if any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent that competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nWe rely in part on trademarks to distinguish our products and services from those of other entities. Trademarks may be opposed or cancelled, and we may be involved in lawsuits or other proceedings to protect or enforce our trademarks.\nWe rely on trademarks, in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions, to distinguish our products and services in the minds of consumers and our business partners from those of other entities. Third parties may challenge our pending trademark applications through opposition proceedings in the U.S., or comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, in which they seek to prevent registration of a mark. Our registered trademarks may be subject to cancellation proceedings in the U.S., or comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, in which a third party seeks to cancel an existing registration. To enforce our trademark rights, we may be involved in lawsuits or other proceedings which could be expensive, time-consuming and uncertain.", "PERMNO": 14033, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ONVO"}
