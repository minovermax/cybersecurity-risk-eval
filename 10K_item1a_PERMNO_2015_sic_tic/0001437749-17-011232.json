{"cik": "25895", "company": "CROWN CRAFTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-06-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors as well as the other information contained in this report and other filings made by the Company with the SEC should be considered in evaluating the Company\u2019s business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, operating results may be affected in future periods.\nThe loss of one or more of the Company\u2019s key customers could result in a material loss of revenues.\nThe Company\u2019s top two customers represented approximately 61% of gross sales in fiscal year 2017. Although the Company does not enter into contracts with its key customers, it expects them to continue to be a significant portion of its gross sales in the future. The loss of, or a decline in orders from, one or more of these customers could result in a material decrease in the Company\u2019s revenue and operating income.\nThe loss of one or more of the Company\u2019s licenses could result in a material loss of revenues.\nSales of licensed products represented 62% of the Company\u2019s gross sales in fiscal year 2017, which included 43% of sales associated with the Company\u2019s license agreements with Disney. The Company could experience a material loss of revenues if it is unable to renew its major license agreements or obtain new licenses. Additionally, the volume of sales of licensed products is inherently tied to the success of the characters, films and other licensed programs of the Company\u2019s licensors. A decline in the popularity of these licensed programs or the inability of the licensors to develop new properties for licensing could also result in a material loss of revenues to the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s business is impacted by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which the Company operates.\nThe Company\u2019s growth is largely dependent upon growth in the birthrate, and in particular, the rate of first births. Economic conditions, including the real and perceived threat of a recession, could lead individuals to decide to forgo or delay having children. Even under optimal economic conditions, shifts in demographic trends and preferences could have the consequence of individuals starting to have children later in life and/or having fewer children. These conditions could result in reduced demand for some of the Company\u2019s products, increased order cancellations and returns, an increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories and increased pressure on the prices of the Company\u2019s products. Also, although the Company\u2019s use of a commercial factor significantly reduces the risk associated with collecting accounts receivable, the factor may at any time terminate or limit its approval of shipments to a particular customer, and the likelihood of the factor doing so may increase due to a change in economic conditions. Such an action by the factor could result in the loss of future sales to the affected customer.\nThe Company\u2019s success is dependent upon retaining key management personnel.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s executive management and other key personnel have been integral to the Company\u2019s operations and the execution of its growth strategy. The departure from the Company of one or more of these individuals, along with the inability of the Company to attract qualified and suitable individuals to fill the Company\u2019s open positions, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s growth and operating results.\nRecalls or product liability claims could increase costs or reduce sales.\nThe Company must comply with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which imposes strict standards to protect children from potentially harmful products and which requires that the Company\u2019s products be tested to ensure that they are within acceptable levels for lead and phthalates. The Company must also comply with related regulations developed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and similar state regulatory authorities. The Company\u2019s products could be subject to involuntary recalls and other actions by these authorities, and concerns about product safety may lead the Company to voluntarily recall, accept returns or discontinue the sale of select products. Product liability claims could exceed or fall outside the scope of the Company\u2019s insurance coverage. Recalls or product liability claims could result in decreased consumer demand for the Company\u2019s products, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, a diversion of management\u2019s attention from its business and increased customer service and support costs, any or all of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company may need to write down or write off inventory.\nIf product programs end before the inventory is completely sold, then the remaining inventory may have to be sold at less than carrying value. The market value of certain inventory items could drop to below carrying value after a decline in sales, at the end of programs, or when management makes the decision to exit a product group. Such inventory would then need to be written down to the lower of carrying or market value, or possibly completely written off, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe strength of the Company\u2019s competitors may impact the Company\u2019s ability to maintain and grow its sales, which could decrease the Company\u2019s revenues.\nThe infant and toddler consumer products industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with a variety of distributors and manufacturers, both branded and private label. The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends principally on styling, price, service to the retailer and continued high regard for the Company\u2019s products and trade names. Several of these competitors are larger than the Company and have greater financial resources than the Company, and some have experienced financial challenges from time to time, including servicing significant levels of debt. Those facing financial pressures could choose to make particularly aggressive pricing decisions in an attempt to increase revenue. The effects of increased competition could result in a material decrease in the Company\u2019s revenues.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to anticipate and respond to consumers\u2019 tastes and preferences could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues.\nSales are driven by consumer demand for the Company\u2019s products. There can be no assurance that the demand for the Company\u2019s products will not decline or that the Company will be able to anticipate and respond to changes in demand. The Company\u2019s failure to adapt to these changes could lead to lower sales and excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s debt covenants may affect its liquidity or limit its ability to pursue acquisitions, incur debt, make investments, sell assets or complete other significant transactions.\nThe Company\u2019s credit facility contains usual and customary covenants regarding significant transactions, including restrictions on other indebtedness, liens, transfers of assets, investments and acquisitions, merger or consolidation transactions, transactions with affiliates and changes in or amendments to the organizational documents for the Company and its subsidiaries. Unless waived by the Company\u2019s lender, these covenants could limit the Company\u2019s ability to pursue opportunities to expand its business operations, respond to changes in business and economic conditions and obtain additional financing, or otherwise engage in transactions that the Company considers beneficial.\nCustomer pricing pressures could result in lower selling prices, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s customers could place pressure on the Company to reduce the prices of its products. The Company continuously strives to stay ahead of its competition in sourcing, which allows the Company to obtain lower cost products while maintaining high standards for quality. There can be no assurance that the Company could respond to a decrease in sales prices by proportionately reducing its costs, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nChanges in international trade regulations and other risks associated with foreign trade could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sourcing.\nThe Company sources its products primarily from foreign contract manufacturers, with the largest concentration being in China. Difficulties encountered by these suppliers, such as the instability inherent in operating within an authoritarian political structure, could halt or disrupt production of the Company\u2019s products. The Chinese government could make allegations against the Company of corruption or antitrust violations, or could adopt regulations related to the importation of products, including quotas, duties, taxes and other charges or restrictions on imported goods, any of which could result in an increase in the cost of the Company\u2019s products. Also, an arbitrary strengthening of the Chinese currency versus the U.S. dollar could increase the prices at which the Company purchases finished goods. Any event causing a disruption of the flow of products manufactured on behalf of the Company, whether within the Chinese interior or at the point of embarkation, could result in delays in the receipt of the Company\u2019s inventory and an increase in the cost of the Company\u2019s products. In addition, changes in U.S. customs procedures or delays in the clearance of goods through customs could result in the Company being unable to deliver goods to customers in a timely manner or the potential loss of sales altogether. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nA significant disruption to the Company\u2019s distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase transportation costs, which would decrease the Company\u2019s profits.\nNearly all of the Company\u2019s products are imported from China into the Port of Long Beach in southern California. There are many links in the distribution chain, including the availability of ocean freight, cranes, dockworkers, containers, tractors, chassis and drivers. The timely receipt of the Company\u2019s products is also dependent upon efficient operations at the Port of Long Beach. Any shortages in the availability of any of these links or disruptions in port operations, including strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages or slowdowns, could cause bottlenecks and other congestion in the distribution network, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to obtain adequate inventory on a timely basis and result in lost sales, increased transportation costs and an overall decrease of the Company\u2019s profits.\nThe Company\u2019s sourcing and marketing operations in foreign countries are subject to anti-corruption laws.\nThe Company\u2019s foreign operations are subject to laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions, which apply to the Company\u2019s directors, officers, employees and agents acting on behalf of the Company. Failure to comply with these laws could result in damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, a diversion of management\u2019s attention from its business, increased legal and investigative costs, and civil and criminal penalties, any or all of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company could experience adjustments to its effective tax rate or its prior tax obligations, either of which could adversely affect its results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the many jurisdictions in which it operates, including the U.S., several U.S. states and China. At any particular point in time, several tax years are subject to general examination or other adjustment by these various jurisdictions. Although management believes that the calculations and positions taken on its original and amended filed returns are reasonable and justifiable, negotiations or litigation leading to the final outcome of any examination or claim for refund could result in an adjustment to the position that the Company has taken. Such adjustment could result in further adjustment to one or more income tax returns for other jurisdictions, or to income tax returns for prior or subsequent tax years, or both. The overall effect of such adjustments could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s provision for income taxes is based on its effective tax rate, which in any given financial statement period could fluctuate based on changes in tax laws or regulations, changes in the mix and level of earnings by taxing jurisdiction, changes in the amount of certain expenses within the consolidated statements of income that will never be deductible on the Company\u2019s income tax returns and certain charges deducted on the Company\u2019s income tax returns that are not included within the consolidated statements of income. These changes could cause fluctuations in the Company\u2019s effective tax rate either on an absolute basis, or in relation to varying levels of the Company\u2019s pre-tax income. Such fluctuations in the Company\u2019s effective tax rate could adversely affect its results of operations.\nDisruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology systems could negatively affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are highly dependent upon computer hardware and software systems, including customized information technology systems and cloud-based applications. The Company also employs third-party systems and software that are integral to its operations. These systems are vulnerable to disruptions and security breaches by computer hackers and cyber terrorists. The Company has implemented security measures to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information stored on the Company\u2019s information systems and continually invests in maintaining and upgrading the systems and applications to mitigate these risks. There can be no assurance that these measures and technology will adequately prevent an intrusion or that a third-party that is relied upon by the Company will not suffer an intrusion, that unauthorized individuals will not gain access to confidential or proprietary information or that any such incident will be timely detected and effectively countered. A significant data security breach could result in a disruption to the Company\u2019s operations and could adversely impact its results of operations.\nThe Company could experience losses associated with its intellectual property.\nThe Company relies upon the fair interpretation and enforcement of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the U.S., similar laws in other countries, and agreements with employees, customers, suppliers, licensors and other parties. Such reliance serves to establish and maintain the intellectual property rights associated with the products that the Company develops and sells. However, the laws and courts of certain countries at times do not protect intellectual property rights or respect contractual agreements to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions the Company may not be able to protect its intellectual property rights against counterfeiting or enforce its contractual agreements with other parties. In addition, another party could claim that the Company is infringing upon such party\u2019s intellectual property rights, and claims of this type could lead to a civil complaint.\nAn unfavorable outcome in litigation involving intellectual property could result in any or all of the following: (i) civil judgments against the Company, which could require the payment of royalties on both past and future sales of certain products, as well as plaintiff\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and other litigation costs; (ii) impairment charges of up to the carrying value of the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights; (iii) restrictions on the ability of the Company to sell certain of its products; (iv) legal and other costs associated with investigations and litigation; and (v) the Company\u2019s competitive position could be adversely affected.\nEconomic conditions could result in an increase in the amounts paid for the Company\u2019s products.\nSignificant increases in the price of raw materials that are components of the Company\u2019s products, including cotton, oil and labor, could adversely affect the amounts that the Company must pay its suppliers for its finished goods. If the Company is unable to pass these cost increases along to its customers, its profitability could be adversely affected.\nA stockholder could lose all or a portion of his or her investment in the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock has historically experienced a degree of price variability, and the price could be subject to rapid and substantial fluctuations. The Company\u2019s common stock has also historically been thinly traded, a circumstance that exists when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders for the Company\u2019s common stock at any given point in time. In such situations, a stockholder may be unable to liquidate his or her position in the Company\u2019s common stock at the desired price. Also, as an equity investment, a stockholder\u2019s investment in the Company is subordinate to the interests of the Company\u2019s creditors, and a stockholder could lose all or a substantial portion of his or her investment in the Company in the event of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy filing or liquidation.", "PERMNO": 59256, "SIC": 2211, "TIC": "CRWS"}
