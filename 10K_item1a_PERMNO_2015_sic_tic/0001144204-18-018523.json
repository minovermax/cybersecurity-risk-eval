Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information included in this Annual Report, the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business, financial position and future prospects. Any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position or future prospects. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from what we have projected. Investing in our common stock is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. Any potential investor should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before purchasing any shares of our common stock. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know or that we currently believe are immaterial which could also materially adversely affect our business, financial position or future prospects. As a result, the trading price of our stock could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment. Our business, financial condition and operating results, or the value of any investment you make in the stock of our company, or both, could be adversely affected by any of the factors listed and described below.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm expresses substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur auditors, MaloneBailey LLP, have indicated in their report on the Company\u2019s financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to our recurring losses from operations. A \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of equity, incurring debt, or other financing alternatives.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had a working capital deficit of $2,198,926, principally due to the inclusion of non-cash derivative liability recorded in current liabilities. Excluding the derivative liability, the Company\u2019s working capital would have been $785,084. In addition, the Company used actual net cash in operations of $1,622,719 during the year ended December 31, 2017. Even with a greater focus on cash revenue generation and the ongoing cost reductions, the conditions described in the first paragraph, above, raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. While the Company has been successful in raising capital in the past, there is no assurance that it will be successful at raising additional capital in the future. Additionally, if the Company\u2019s plans are not achieved and/or if significant unanticipated events occur, the Company may have to further modify its business plan.\nWe have a history of generating significant losses and may not be able to achieve and sustain profitability.\nTo date, we have not been profitable, and we may never achieve profitability on a full-year or consistent basis. We incurred net losses of $5,607,839 for the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we have an accumulated deficit of $39,425,900 and working capital deficit of $2,198,926. If we continue to experience losses, we may not be able to continue our operations, and investors may lose their entire investment.\nOur future development requires substantial capital, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which would prevent us from fully developing our business and generating revenues.\nAs of April 2, 2018, our cash available was $1,361,853. Our business plan will require additional capital expenditures, and our capital outlays could increase substantially over the next several years as we implement our business plan. As a result, and since we do not believe we will operate profitably during that period, we expect that we will need to raise substantial additional capital, through future private or public equity offerings, strategic alliances or debt financing. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: market conditions, sales personnel cost, cost of litigation in enforcing our patents, and information technology (IT) development and acquisition costs. No assurance can be given that we can successfully raise additional equity or debt capital, or that such financing will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe are subject to ongoing litigation.\nIn April 2015, two shareholder class action lawsuits were filed against the Company and former officers Nathaniel Bradley and Edward O\u2019Donnell in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiffs alleged various causes of action against the defendants arising from our announcement that our previously issued financial results for the first three quarters of 2014 and the guidance for the fourth quarter of 2014 and the full year of 2014 could no longer be relied upon. The complaints sought among other relief, compensatory damages and plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s fees and experts\u2019 fees. The Court appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel, and consolidated the actions. A consolidated amended complaint was filed under the caption In re AudioEye, Inc. Sec. Litigation. The Company and individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss.\nOn July 25, 2016, in connection with a voluntary mediation, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the consolidated actions. The terms of the agreement include a settlement payment to the class of $1,525,000 from the Company\u2019s insurer, with no admission of liability by any party. In 2015, the Company paid a deductible under its D&O insurance policy in the amount of $100,000 regarding this matter. On May 8, 2017, the Court approved the settlement in all respects, and dismissed the case with prejudice.\nOn January 23, 2017, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement pursuant to the terms set forth in the Stipulation of Settlement, provisionally certified a settlement class of shareholders, and directed plaintiffs' counsel to provide notice to that class. The Court held a Settlement Hearing May 8, 2017 to consider any objections to the Settlement that might be raised by settlement class members, to consider plaintiffs\u2019 counsel's application for an award of fees and costs, and to determine whether the Order and Final Judgment as provided under the Stipulation of Settlement should be entered, dismissing the case with prejudice. On May 8, 2017, this Court granted final approval to the settlement of the securities class action brought by Lead Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated. On February 9, 2018, the Court authorized distribution of the Net Settlement Fund and to approved the proposed modified plan of allocation.\nOn May 16, 2016, a shareholder derivative complaint entitled LiPoChing, Derivatively and on Behalf of AudioEye, Inc., v. Bradley, et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. As a derivative complaint, the plaintiff-shareholder purported to act on behalf of the Company against the Named Individuals. The Company was named as a nominal defendant. The complaint asserted causes of action including breach of fiduciary duty and others, arising from the Company\u2019s restatement of its financial results for the first three quarters of 2014. The complaint sought, among other relief, compensatory damages, restitution and attorneys\u2019 fees. In October 2016, the Company and Named Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. In response, the Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the complaint without prejudice. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel subsequently submitted a demand to the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, to investigate the circumstances surrounding restatement of its financial results for the first three quarters of 2014. The Board has formed an Independent Director lead special litigation committee to evaluate the demand and make a recommendation to the Board. No determination has been made at this time.\nOn July 26, 2016, a shareholder derivative complaint entitled Denese M. Hebert, derivatively on Behalf of Nominal Defendant AudioEye, Inc., v. Bradley, et al., was filed in the State of Arizona Superior Court for Pima County. The complaint generally asserted causes of action related to the Company\u2019s restatement of its financial statements for the first three fiscal quarters of 2014. As a derivative complaint, the plaintiff-shareholder purported to act on behalf of the Company against the Named Individuals. The Company was named as a nominal defendant. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which the Court granted on May 8, 2017, while also denying Plaintiff\u2019s request for leave to amend the complaint. As in the above matter, after this matter was dismissed Plaintiff\u2019s counsel subsequently submitted a demand to the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, to investigate the circumstances surrounding restatement of its financial results for the first three quarters of 2014. This demand is being evaluated together with the above demand by the Board\u2019s Independent Director lead special litigation committee. No determination has been made at this time.\nWe may become involved in various other routine disputes and allegations incidental to our business operations. While it is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition of these matters, our management believes that the resolution of any such matters, should they arise, is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nCurrent economic and credit conditions could adversely affect our plan of operations.\nOur ability to secure additional financing and satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance, which is subject to the prevailing general economic and credit market conditions, including interest rate levels and the availability of credit generally, and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The prolonged continuation or worsening of current credit market conditions would have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure financing on favorable terms, if at all.\nOur revenue and collections may be materially adversely affected by an economic downturn.\nCurrent macroeconomic conditions continue to show signs of volatility and potential weakness. We believe commercial purchasing habits and corporate information technology budgets have improved modestly in recent years, but remain relatively constrained and subject to such volatile and uncertain economic conditions. Any deterioration in prevailing economic conditions would likely result in reduced demand for our services and products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position or results of operations.\nAn increase in market interest rates could increase our interest costs on future debt and could adversely affect our stock price.\nIf interest rates increase, so could our interest costs for any new debt. This increased cost could make the financing of any acquisition costlier. We may incur variable interest rate indebtedness in the future. Rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance debt when it matures, or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increased interest expense on refinanced indebtedness.\nWe are dependent on certain members of our management and technical team.\nInvestors in our common stock must rely upon the ability, expertise, judgment and discretion of our management and the success of our technical team in exploiting our technology. Our performance and success are dependent, in part, upon key members of our management and technical team. The departure of key persons could be detrimental to our future success. Members of our current management hold a significant percentage of our common stock. We cannot assure you that our management will remain in place. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies. The loss of any of our management and technical team members could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as on the market price of our common stock.\nWe intend to pursue new strategic opportunities which may result in the use of a significant amount of our management resources or significant costs, and we may not be able to fully realize the potential benefit of such transactions.\nWe intend to seek other strategic partners to help us pursue our strategic, marketing, sales or technical objectives. Although we may devote significant time and resources in pursuit of such transactions, we may struggle to successfully identify such opportunities, or to successfully conclude transactions with potential strategic partners. Should we be unable to identify or conclude important strategic transactions, our business prospects and operations could be adversely affected as a result of the devotion of significant managerial effort required, and the challenges of achieving our objectives in the absence of strategic partners. In addition, we may incur significant costs in connection with seeking acquisitions or other strategic opportunities regardless of whether the transaction is completed and in combining its operations if such a transaction is completed. In the event that we consummate an acquisition or strategic alternative in the future, we cannot assure you that we would fully realize the potential benefit of such a transaction.\nOur business plan may not be realized. If our business plan proves to be unsuccessful, our business may fail and you may lose your entire investment.\nOur operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise with a limited operating history. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the development of a new business. Unanticipated events may occur that could affect the actual results achieved during the forecast periods. Consequently, the actual results of operations during the forecast periods will vary from the forecasts, and such variations may be material. In addition, the degree of uncertainty increases with each successive year presented. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in the anticipated operation of our business plan. If our business plan proves to be unsuccessful, our business may fail and you may lose your entire investment.\nIf we are not able to adequately protect our patented rights, our operations would be negatively impacted.\nOur ability to compete largely depends on the superiority, uniqueness and value of our technology and intellectual property. To protect our intellectual property rights, we will rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions. We cannot assure you that infringement or invalidity claims (or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims) will not be asserted or prosecuted against us or that any such assertions or prosecutions will not materially adversely affect our business.\nRegardless of whether these or any future claims are valid or can be successfully asserted, defending against such claims could cause us to incur significant costs, could jeopardize or substantially delay a successful outcome in any future litigation, and could divert resources away from our other activities. In addition, assertion of infringement claims could result in injunctions that prevent us from distributing our products. In addition to challenges against our existing patents, any of the following could also reduce the value of our intellectual property now, or in the future:\n\u00b7 our applications for patents, trademarks and copyrights relating to our business may not be granted and, if granted, may be challenged or invalidated;\n\u00b7 issued trademarks, copyrights or patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages;\n\u00b7 our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our technology; or\n\u00b7 our efforts may not prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to, competitive with, or superior to those that we develop.\nAlso, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries where we may do business in the future or from which competitors may operate. Obtaining patents will not necessarily protect our technology or prevent our international competitors from developing similar products or technologies. Our inability to adequately protect our patented rights would have a negative impact on our operations and revenues.\nIn addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in Internet-related businesses are uncertain and still evolving. Because of the growth of the Internet and Internet-related businesses, patent applications are continuously and simultaneously being filed in connection with Internet-related technology. There are a significant number of U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest, and we believe that there has been, and is likely to continue to be, significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights.\nWe may commence legal proceedings against third parties who we believe are infringing on our intellectual property rights, and if we are forced to litigate to defend our intellectual property rights, or to defend claims by third parties against us relating to intellectual property rights, legal fees and court injunctions could adversely affect our financial condition or potentially end our business.\nAt present, we do not have any active or pending litigation related to the violation of our patents. We expect an increase in the number of third parties who could violate our patents as the market develops new uses of similar products and consumers begin to increase their adoption of the technology and integrate it into their daily lives. We do foresee the potential need to enter into active litigation to defend the enforcement of our patents. We anticipate that these legal proceedings could continue for several years and may require significant expenditures for legal fees and other expenses. In the event we are not successful through appeal and do not subsequently obtain monetary and injunctive relief, these litigation matters may significantly reduce our financial resources and have a material impact on our ability to continue our operations. The time and effort required of our management to effectively pursue these litigation matters may adversely affect our ability to operate our business, since time spent on matters related to the lawsuits will take away from the time spent on managing and operating the business. We cannot assure that any such potential lawsuits will result in a final outcome that is favorable to our shareholders or the company.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience competition as more companies seek to provide products and services similar to our products and services; and because larger and better-financed competitors may affect our ability to operate our business and achieve profitability, our business may fail.\nWe expect competition for our products and services to become more intense. We compete directly against other companies offering similar products and services that will compete directly with our proposed products and services. We also compete against established vendors in our markets. These companies may incorporate other competitive technologies into their product offerings, whether developed internally or by third parties. There are also established consultants who offer services to help their customers obtain compliance with accessibilities standards. In many cases these consultants compete for the same funding from our prospective customers. For the foreseeable future, substantially all of our competitors are likely to be larger, better-financed companies that may develop products superior to our current and proposed products, which could create significant competitive advantages for those companies. Our future success depends on our ability to compete effectively with our competitors. As a result, we may have difficulty competing with larger, established competitors. Generally, these competitors have:\n\u00b7 substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources;\n\u00b7 a larger customer base;\n\u00b7 better name recognition; and\n\u00b7 more expansive or different product offerings.\nThese competitors may command a larger market share than us, which may enable them to establish a stronger competitive position, in part, through greater marketing opportunities. Further, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in user preferences and to devote greater resources to developing new products and offering new services. These competitors may develop products or services that are comparable or superior to ours. If we fail to address competitive developments quickly and effectively, we may not be able to remain a viable business.\nThe burdens of being a public company may adversely affect our ability to develop our business and pursue a litigation strategy.\nAs a public company, our management must devote substantial time, attention and financial resources to comply with U.S. securities laws. This may have a material adverse effect on our management\u2019s ability to effectively and efficiently develop our business initiatives. In addition, our disclosure obligations under U.S. securities laws may require us to disclose information publicly that could have a material adverse effect on our potential litigation strategies.\nThe current regulatory environment for our products and services remains unclear.\nWe cannot assure you that our existing or planned product and service offerings will be in compliance with local, state and/or federal U.S. laws or the laws of any foreign jurisdiction where we may operate in the future. Further, we cannot assure you that we will not unintentionally violate such laws or that such laws will not be modified, or that new laws will not be enacted in the future, which would cause us to be in violation of such laws. More aggressive domestic or international regulation of the Internet may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and future prospects.\nAs pressure of legal ramifications from non-compliance with Web Accessibility increases, clients may be less inclined to permit or may delay AudioEye from promoting client relationships and/or the specifics associated with those relationships, and if this restricts our public communications with investors and shareholders, it may negatively impact our ability to gain interest in our business from investors and shareholders.\nDue to an undefined regulatory environment and a heightened sensitivity by plaintiffs seeking retribution for inaccessible and unusable digital interfaces, any organization may be sued or served legal demands claiming non-compliance. As these demands may be served with or without merit, they present a new level of risk for website owners and publishers. In an effort to avoid any potential unwanted attention pertaining to the subject of compliance, AudioEye clients may enforce rigid stipulations pertaining to AudioEye\u2019s promotion of their involvement or engagement with AudioEye, regardless of the level of success or positive impact any such engagement may have or have had on their business. Whether through the enforcement of non-disclosure agreements or through specific non-disclosure language associated with client contracts, if AudioEye is not empowered to promptly make public announcements about its client base and the adoption of AudioEye products and services, it may have a deleterious effect on the company\u2019s capacity to accelerate its business growth or attract investment from shareholders.\nOur business greatly depends on the growth of online services and other next-generation Internet-based services and applications.\nThe Internet may ultimately prove not to be a viable commercial marketplace for such applications for a number of reasons, including:\n\u00b7 unwillingness of consumers to shift to and use other such next-generation cloud-based services;\n\u00b7 Distrust for security of cloud-based services;\n\u00b7 perception by end-users with respect to product and service quality and performance;\n\u00b7 limitations on access and ease of use;\n\u00b7 congestion leading to delayed or extended response times;\n\u00b7 inadequate development of Internet infrastructure to keep pace with increased levels of use; and\n\u00b7 increased government regulations.\nIf the market for our online services does not grow as anticipated, our business would be adversely affected.\nWhile other next-generation Internet-based applications have grown rapidly in personal and professional use, we cannot assure you that the adoption of our products and services will grow at a comparable rate, or grow at all.\nWe expect that we will experience long and unpredictable sales cycles, which may impact our operating results.\nWe expect that our sales cycles will be long and unpredictable due to a number of uncertainties such as:\n\u00b7 the need to educate potential customers about the current state of accessibility for those with disabilities;\n\u00b7 customers\u2019 willingness to invest potentially substantial resources and infrastructures to take advantage of our products and services;\n\u00b7 customers\u2019 budgetary constraints;\n\u00b7 the timing of customers\u2019 budget cycles; and\n\u00b7 delays caused by customers\u2019 internal review and procurement processes.\nWe historically have been dependent on a concentrated number of customers, and have stopped doing business with certain customers who historically represented a significant portion of our revenues during the past two years as the Company migrates to a SaaS model.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, two major customers generated approximately 28.4% and 45.3% of our revenue, respectively. We have fundamentally shifted our business model to focus on software as a service (SaaS) product offerings, and this shift has caused us to stop doing business with certain customers who historically represented a significant portion of our revenue. We have not yet proven that we can develop and maintain a diversified customer base who will subscribe to our SaaS-centric products and services. If we are unable to continue to establish, maintain, grow or replace our relationships with customers and develop a diversified customer base, our revenues may fluctuate and our growth may be limited.\nOur expansion into new products, services, technologies, and geographic regions subjects us to additional business, legal, financial, and competitive risks.\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our new offerings. These offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\nWe face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancy.\nWe experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently providing services to third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. If we are unable to continually add software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems, it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy.\nGovernment regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and other services. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, web services, the provision of online payment services, information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services, the design and operation of websites, the characteristics and quality of products and services, and the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, and personal privacy apply to the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, and web services. Unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business.\nWe could be subject to additional sales tax or other indirect tax liabilities.\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales taxes with respect to remote sales. However, an increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws or administrative practices that attempt to impose obligations on out-of-state businesses to collect taxes on their behalf. A successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries requiring us to collect taxes where we do not do so could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest.\nWe may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations.\nOur contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause.\nIf we do not successfully develop our planned products and services in a cost-effective manner to customer demand in the rapidly evolving market for next-generation Internet-based applications and services, our business may fail.\nThe market for next-generation Internet-based applications and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changes in customer needs, and frequent new service and product introductions. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to use new technologies effectively, to continue to develop our technical expertise and proprietary technology, to enhance our existing products and services, and to develop new products and services that meet changing customer needs on a timely and cost-effective basis. We may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing technology, customer requirements and industry standards. If we fail to use new technologies effectively, to develop our technical expertise and new products and services, or to enhance existing products and services in a timely basis, either internally or through arrangements with third parties, our product and service offerings may fail to meet customer needs, which would adversely affect our revenues and prospects for growth.\nIn addition, if we are unable to, for technological, legal, financial or other reasons, adapt in a timely manner to changing market conditions or customer requirements, we could lose customers, strategic alliances and market share. Sudden changes in user and customer requirements and preferences, the frequent introduction of new products and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render our existing products, services and systems obsolete. The emerging nature of products and services in the technology and communications industry and their rapid evolution will require that we continually improve the performance, features and reliability of our products and services. Our survival and success will depend, in part, on our ability to:\n\u00b7 design, develop, launch and/or license our planned products, services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers; and\n\u00b7 respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis.\nThe development of our planned products and services and other patented technology involves significant technological and business risks and requires substantial expenditures and lead time. We may be unable to use new technologies effectively. Updating our technology internally and licensing new technology from third parties may also require us to incur significant additional expenditures.\nIf our products and services do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to fund future operations.\nA number of factors may affect the market acceptance of our products or services or any other products or services we develop or acquire, including, among others:\n\u00b7 the price of our products or services relative to other competitive products;\n\u00b7 the perception by users of the effectiveness of our products and services;\n\u00b7 our ability to fund our sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u00b7 the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.\nIf our products and services do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to fund future operations, including the development of new products and services and/or our sales and marketing efforts for our current products and services, which inability would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe continually develop new products and product enhancements and actively capitalize software development costs, while making educated assumptions to anticipate the attributed revenue to be derived from each development or enhancement. If our assumptions are incorrect or if we are unable to attribute revenue to each respective product or product enhancement, we may have to account for impairment, thus reversing the capitalized expenditures.\nOur product developers are consistently programming new products and enhancements to existing products. Under the guidance of U.S Accounting Standard, ASC 350-40, we make determinations to estimate the useful life of each of these products and enhancements. Based on these determinations, we amortize software expenses over the pre-determined period of time. Based on our financial forecasts and regular impairment testing, we believe that sufficient cash flows will be realized from our product development and product enhancements. Should our estimates turn out to be inaccurate or should the business fail to attract new revenue in relation to each respective product or product enhancement, we may have to file for impairment of the relative capitalized expens(es).\nOur products and services are highly technical and may contain undetected errors, which could cause harm to our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOur products and services are highly technical and complex and, when deployed, may contain errors or defects. Despite testing, some errors in our products and services may only be discovered after they have been installed and used by customers. Any errors or defects discovered in our products and services after commercial release could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customers, and increased service and warranty cost, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we could face claims for product liability, tort or breach of warranty. The performance of our products and services could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as on third-party applications and services that utilize our products and services, which could result in legal claims against us, harming our business. Furthermore, we expect to provide implementation, consulting and other technical services in connection with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of our products and services, which typically involves working with sophisticated software, computing and communications systems. We expect that our contracts with customers will contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, which may not be upheld. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert our management\u2019s attention and adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of us and our products and services. In addition, if our business liability insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nMalfunctions of third-party communications infrastructure, hardware and software expose us to a variety of risks we cannot control.\nOur business will depend upon the capacity, reliability and security of the infrastructure owned by third parties over which our product offerings would be deployed. We have no control over the operation, quality or maintenance of a significant portion of that infrastructure or whether or not those third parties will upgrade or improve their equipment. We do depend on these companies to maintain the operational integrity of our integrated connections. If one or more of these companies is unable or unwilling to supply or expand its levels of service in the future, our operations could be adversely impacted. Also, to the extent the number of users of networks utilizing our future products and services suddenly increases, the technology platform and secure hosting services which will be required to accommodate a higher volume of traffic may result in slower response times or service interruptions. System interruptions or increases in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users and, if sustained or repeated, could reduce the appeal of the networks to users. In addition, users depend on real-time communications; outages caused by increased traffic could result in delays and system failures. These types of occurrences could cause users to perceive that our products and services do not function properly and could therefore adversely affect our ability to attract and retain licensees, strategic partners and customers.\nSystem failure or interruption or our failure to meet increasing demands on our systems could harm our business.\nThe success of our product and service offerings will depend on the uninterrupted operation of various systems, secure data centers, and other computer and communication networks that we use or establish. To the extent the number of users of networks utilizing our future products and services suddenly increases, the technology platform and hosting services which will be required to accommodate a higher volume of traffic may result in slower response times, service interruptions or delays or system failures. The deployment of our products, services, systems and operations will also be vulnerable to damage or interruption from:\n\u00b7 power loss, transmission cable cuts and other telecommunications failures;\n\u00b7 damage or interruption caused by fire, earthquake and other natural disasters;\n\u00b7 computer viruses or software defects; and\n\u00b7 physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control.\nSystem interruptions or failures and increases or delays in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users and, if sustained or repeated, could reduce the appeal of our products and services to users. These types of occurrences could cause users to perceive that our products and services do not function properly and could therefore adversely affect our ability to attract and retain licensees, strategic partners and customers.\nOur ability to sell our solutions will be dependent on the quality of our technical support and our failure to deliver high-quality technical support services could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nIf we do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our products and services, succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues and provide effective ongoing support, or if potential customers perceive that we may not be able to successfully deliver the foregoing, our ability to sell our products and services would be adversely affected, and our reputation with potential customers could be harmed. In addition, if we expand our operations internationally, our technical support team will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support, training and documentation in languages other than the English language. As a result, our failure to deliver and maintain high-quality technical support services to our customers could result in customers choosing to use our competitors\u2019 products or services in the future.\nWe will need to recruit and retain additional qualified personnel to successfully grow our business.\nOur future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified operations, marketing and sales personnel as well as technical personnel. Inability to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business. Competition for technical, sales, marketing and executive personnel is intense, particularly in the technology and Internet sectors. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain such personnel.\nGrowth of internal operations and business may strain our financial resources.\nWe may need to significantly expand the scope of our operating and financial systems in order to build our business. Our growth rate may place a significant strain on our financial resources for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 the need for continued development of our financial and information management systems;\n\u00b7 the need to manage relationships with future licensees, resellers, distributors and strategic partners;\n\u00b7 the need to hire and retain skilled management, technical and other personnel necessary to support and manage our business; and\n\u00b7 the need to train and manage our employee base.\nThe addition of products and services and the attention they demand, may also strain our management resources.\nWe do not expect to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future, which will affect the extent to which our investors realize any future gains on their investment.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our convertible preferred and common stock in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, investors must rely the ability to convert preferred stock to common stock and on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nWe previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which resulted in a restatement of our previously issued quarterly financial statements during 2014. If our remedial measures were insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain errors and we could be required to further restate our financial results, which could adversely affect our stock price.\nIn 2015, we concluded that there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as we did not maintain effective controls over the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) related to revenue recognition for certain non-monetary transactions. Specifically, the members of our management team with the requisite level of accounting knowledge, experience and training commensurate with our financial reporting requirements did not analyze certain accounting transactions at the level of detail required to ensure the proper application of GAAP in certain circumstances. Errors in the application of the accounting principles and errors which impacted revenues recognition were related to our failure to maintain effective internal controls over the accounting for revenue recognition. Our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2014 were amended to reflect the restatement of our financial statements for the restated periods and the change in management\u2019s conclusion regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nThe Company took steps to remediate the weaknesses described above. Multiple levels of supervision have been implemented and the firm has improved cross reconciliations of internal parties\u2019 actions and approvals. Singular levels of approval, supervision and processing have been eliminated. All contracts are thoroughly reviewed by management and at certain levels require Board approval. The Company no longer engages in non-monetary transactions related to Intellectual Property. All sales transactions are representative of cash contracts in the form of Subscription and Services Agreements. Revenue is recognized by following stringent guidelines which include the appropriate application of journal entries in sales, deferred revenue and accounts receivable in the General Ledger. Revenue is recognized as a portion of the contract term as services are delivered, and deferred revenue is recorded, only upon the receipt of cash. Timing and accounts affected by the respective journal entry are triggered when payment is received and applied to invoices in accounts receivable.\nWith our annual reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2017 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nIn addition, the remediation steps we have taken and continue to take may be insufficient to prevent future restatements or delays in financial reporting. Restatements or delays in filing the requisite materials with the SEC could reoccur and may impact our ability to be allowed to trade on various trading platforms. Such limitation may impact the trading price of our shares.\nRisks Related to the Market for Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur common stock started being listed on the OTCQB and the OTC Bulletin Board effective April 15, 2013 under the symbol \u201cAEYE.\u201d Beginning on April 16, 2015, our common shares were quoted on the OTC Pink marketplace due to our inability to timely file certain documents with the SEC. We resumed trading on the OTCQB effective July 23, 2015.\nThe trading price of our common stock has historically been subject to significant volatility. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 regulatory developments in the United States and any foreign countries where we may operate;\n\u00b7 the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7 quarterly or annual variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7 market conditions in the industries in which we compete and issuance of new or changed securities;\n\u00b7 analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u00b7 the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock or changes in financial estimates by analysts;\n\u00b7 the inability to meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow our common stock, if any;\n\u00b7 the issuance of any additional securities by us;\n\u00b7 investor perception of us and of the industry in which we compete; and\n\u00b7 general economic, political and market conditions.\nTrading on the OTCQB and OTC Bulletin Board may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common shares and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares.\nTrading in shares quoted on the OTCQB and OTC Bulletin Board is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of shares of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTCQB and OTC Bulletin Board are not stock exchanges, and trading of securities on the OTCQB and OTC Bulletin Board is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on exchanges like NASDAQ or NYSE MKT. Accordingly, stockholders may have difficulty reselling shares of our common stock.\nA substantial number of shares of our common stock may be sold into the market at any time. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nOur stock is a penny stock; trading of shares of our common stock may be restricted by the SEC\u2019s penny stock regulations, which may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our shares.\nOur stock is a penny stock. The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors.\u201d The term \u201caccredited investor\u201d refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the shares that are subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common shares.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell shares of our common stock.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules promulgated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or the FINRA, has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, the FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some brokerage customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy shares of our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell shares of our common stock.\nWhen we issue additional shares in the future, it will likely result in the dilution of our existing stockholders\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 250,000,000 shares of common stock with a $0.00001 par value and 10,000,000 preferred shares with a par value of $0.00001, of which 143,438,396 common shares were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and 110,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock (convertible into 7,108,995 shares of common stock) were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2017. From time to time we may increase the number of shares available for issuance in connection with our equity compensation plans. Our board of directors may fix and determine the designations, rights, preferences or other variations of each class or series within each class of preferred stock and may choose to issue some or all of such shares to provide additional financing or acquire more businesses in the future.\nMoreover, as of December 31, 2017, we had warrants, options and restricted stock units to purchase an aggregate of 77,001,363 shares of our common stock, the exercise of which would further increase the number of outstanding shares. The issuance of any shares for acquisition, licensing or financing efforts, upon conversion of any preferred stock or exercise of warrants and options, pursuant to our equity compensation plans, or otherwise may result in a reduction of the book value and market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If we issue any such additional shares, such issuance will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current stockholders.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the public market may result in significant downward pressure on the price of our common stock and could affect your ability to realize the current trading price of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause a reduction in the market price of our common stock. To the extent stockholders sell shares of common stock, the price of our common stock may decrease due to the additional shares of common stock in the market.\nAny significant downward pressure on the price of our common stock as stockholders sell their shares could encourage short sales of our common stock. Any such short sales could place further downward pressure on the price of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Charter Documents and Capital Structure\nWe are close to being controlled by a small number of \u201cinsider\u201d stockholders.\nAs of April 2, 2018, our directors, executive officers and other beneficial owners, beneficially own 134,225,407 common shares including warrants and options which is approximately 83.03% of our outstanding 161,664,077 common shares. The holdings of our directors, executive officers and other affiliated owners represent 25.98% on a fully diluted basis. Accordingly, through their collective ownership of our outstanding common stock, if they act together, will be close to controlling the voting of our shares at all meetings of stockholders and, because the common stock does not have cumulative voting rights, will determine the outcome of the election of all of our directors and determining corporate and stockholder action on other matters.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could deter or prevent a change in control.\nSome provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as statutes, may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control. These provisions, including those providing for the possible issuance of shares of our preferred stock, which may be divided into series and with the preferences, limitations and relative rights to be determined by our board of directors, and the right of the board of directors to amend the bylaws, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire a substantial number of shares of our common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in his or her best interest. These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nDelaware law may delay or prevent takeover attempts by third parties and therefore inhibit our stockholders from realizing a premium on their stock.\nWe are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL. This section prevents any stockholder who owns 15% or more of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations with us for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder acquired such stock ownership unless certain approvals were or are obtained from our board of directors or the holders of 66 2/3% of our outstanding common stock (excluding the shares of our common stock owned by the 15% or more stockholder). Our board of directors can use these and other provisions to discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of our company or a change in our management. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or a change in our board of directors or management could deter potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could receive a substantial premium over the then current market price for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.\nFailure to manage growth effectively could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe success of our future operating activities will depend upon our ability to expand our support system to meet the demands of our growing business. Any failure by our management to effectively anticipate, implement, and manage changes required to sustain our growth would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully operate acquired businesses, become profitable in the future, or effectively manage any other change.\nThe elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under Delaware law and the existence of indemnification rights to our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees.\nOur bylaws contain specific provisions that eliminate the liability of our directors for monetary damages to our company and stockholders, and permit indemnification of our directors and officers to the extent provided by Delaware law. We may also have contractual indemnification obligations under our employment agreements with our officers. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in our company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage our company from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit our company and stockholders.", "PERMNO": 18098, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "AEYE"}
