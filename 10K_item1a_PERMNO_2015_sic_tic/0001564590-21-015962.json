{"cik": "1178253", "company": "SCYNEXIS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nIn evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those we may make from time to time. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently see as immaterial, may also harm our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have never been profitable, we have no products approved for commercial sale, and to date we have not generated any revenue from product sales. As a result, our ability to curtail our losses and reach profitability is unproven, and we may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe are not profitable and do not expect to be profitable in the foreseeable future. We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception, including a net loss of $55.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $326.6 million. On a prospective basis, our strategic focus, along with the commitment of our financial resources, will be directed towards the development and potential commercialization of ibrexafungerp, our lead product candidate. We had cash and cash equivalents of $93.0 million as of December 31, 2020. Based upon our existing operating plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, the sale of a portion of our New Jersey NOLs, the upfront payment from Hansoh, and anticipated sales of Brexafemme will enable us to fund our operating requirements into 2023, although there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue our operations on a long-term basis. We have suffered substantial losses from operations since inception and will require additional financing.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:\n\u2022\ncontinue the development of ibrexafungerp for treatment of multiple indications;\n\u2022\nconduct ongoing and initiate new clinical trials for ibrexafungerp;\n\u2022\nseek marketing approvals for ibrexafungerp;\n\u2022\nestablish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022\nmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nhire additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel;\n\u2022\nmaintain and create additional infrastructure to support our operations as a public company; and\n\u2022\ndevelop in-house product candidates or seek to in-license product candidates from third-parties.\nIn addition, our expenses could increase if we are required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, to perform studies in addition to, or that are larger than, those that we currently expect.\nAs a result of the foregoing, we expect to experience net losses and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future, and we are unable to predict when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. Our losses and negative cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity, financial position and working capital.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur financial condition and operating results have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter or year to year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. The following factors relating to our business, as well as factors described elsewhere in this report, may contribute to these fluctuations:\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with developing ibrexafungerp, which are difficult for us to predict;\n\u2022\nany delays in regulatory review and approval of ibrexafungerp;\n\u2022\ndelays in the timing of submission of any new drug application, or NDA, or supplement thereto, as well as commencement, enrollment and the timing of clinical testing, of ibrexafungerp or any other product candidates we may seek to develop;\n\u2022\nour ability to commercialize product candidates, both in the United States and overseas, if we are able to obtain regulatory approval to do so;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval and ongoing company compliance and product compliance for ibrexafungerp;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulations and regulatory policies;\n\u2022\ncompetition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u2022\nthe ability of patients or healthcare providers to obtain coverage of, or sufficient reimbursement for, any products we are able to develop;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish or maintain collaborations, licensing or other arrangements;\n\u2022\ncosts related to, and outcomes of, potential litigation;\n\u2022\npotential product liability claims; and\n\u2022\npotential liabilities associated with hazardous materials.\nDue to the various factors mentioned above, and others, the results of any quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of future operating performance. Further, any financial projections we make are made as of the date we make them are subject to these risks and uncertainties, and these financial projections may not be realized.\nWe will continue to require substantial additional capital, and if we are unable to raise capital when needed we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our development program for ibrexafungerp.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is expensive. If the FDA requires that we perform additional studies beyond those that we currently expect, our expenses could increase beyond what we currently anticipate, the timing of the submission of our planned NDAs could be delayed, and any potential product approval could be delayed. Based upon our existing operating plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, the sale of a\nportion of our New Jersey NOLs, the upfront payment from Hansoh, and anticipated sales of Brexafemme will enable us to fund our operating requirements into 2023; provided, however, that changing circumstances may cause us to consume cash more rapidly than we currently anticipate. We may need to raise additional funds from additional issuances of equity and/or debt securities or otherwise obtain funding through strategic alliances or collaborations with third parties. In any event, we will require additional capital to complete development of, to seek regulatory approval for and, if approval is obtained, to commercialize ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop.\nWhen we are required to secure additional financing, the additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop. In addition, we cannot guarantee that financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to:\n\u2022\nsignificantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop;\n\u2022\nseek strategic alliances for research and development programs at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; or\n\u2022\nrelinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to any product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nIf we are required to conduct additional fundraising activities and we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we will be prevented from pursuing development and commercialization efforts, which will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nOur operating activities may be restricted as a result of covenants related to the indebtedness under our senior convertible notes and we may be required to repay the notes in an event of default, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nOn March 7, 2019, we entered into a senior convertible note purchase agreement with Puissance Life Science Opportunities Fund VI (Puissance), pursuant to which we issued and sold to Puissance $16 million of our 6.0% senior convertible notes due 2025, and on April 9, 2020, we entered into a senior convertible note purchase agreement with Puissance pursuant to which we issued and sold to Puissance $10 million of our 6.0% senior convertible notes due 2026.\nWe may be required to repay the outstanding notes if an event of default occurs under the note purchase agreements. Under the note purchase agreements, an event of default will occur if, among other things: we fail to make payments under the note purchase agreement; we breach any of our covenants under the note purchase agreements, subject to specified cure periods with respect to certain breaches; or we or our subsidiaries become subject to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization proceedings. We may not have enough available cash or be able to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings to repay such indebtedness at the time any such event of default occurs. In this case, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant to others rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result of any of these events.\nRisks Relating to the Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates For Human Use\nWe cannot be certain that ibrexafungerp will receive regulatory approval, and without regulatory approval we will not be able to market ibrexafungerp. Regulatory approval is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process.\nOur ability to generate significant revenue related to ibrexafungerp sales will depend on the successful development and regulatory approval of ibrexafungerp. We expect that the earliest that we could obtain regulatory approval of ibrexafungerp and commence commercialization of ibrexafungerp will be in June 2021, if at all.\nWe currently have no products approved for sale and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have marketable products. The development and commercialization of a product candidate, including preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, quality systems, labeling, approval, record-keeping, selling, promotion, marketing and distribution of products, is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and regulatory authorities in other countries, with regulations differing from country to country. We are not permitted to market product candidates in the United States until and unless we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA. Although we have submitted an NDA for ibrexafungerp for the treatment of VVC, have not yet received regulatory approval of our NDA for this indication. We have not submitted an NDA for ibrexafungerp for the prevention of recurrent VVC or for the treatment of refractory invasive fungal infections, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis or any other indications. Obtaining approval of an NDA is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. An NDA must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and effectiveness for each indication. The approval application must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing\nand controls for the product. The product development and regulatory review process typically takes years to complete, involves numerous uncertainties and the potential for concerns to emerge late in the development process, and approval is never guaranteed. Even if a product is approved, as we expect will occur for our NDA for ibrexafungerp for the treatment of VVC, the FDA may limit the indications for which the product may be used, require extensive warnings on the product labeling or require costly ongoing requirements for post-marketing clinical studies and surveillance or other risk management measures to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product candidate, including the imposition of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS. Markets outside of the United States also have requirements for approval of drug candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing. Obtaining regulatory approval for marketing of a product candidate in one country does not ensure we will be able to obtain regulatory approval in other countries, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in other countries. Also, any regulatory approval of a product candidate, once obtained, may be withdrawn. If ibrexafungerp or any of our other wholly-owned or partnered product candidates do not receive timely regulatory approval, or fail to maintain that regulatory approval, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become profitable or to continue our operations. Moreover, the submission of our NDA or the receipt of regulatory approval does not assure commercial success of any approved product.\nAlthough both the oral and IV formulations of ibrexafungerp have been granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product status and Fast Track designation, this does not guarantee that the length of the FDA review process will be significantly shorter than otherwise, or that ibrexafungerp will ultimately be approved by the FDA.\nWe applied to the FDA for, and received, the designation of the oral tablet and the IV formulations of ibrexafungerp for vulvovaginal candidiasis, invasive candidiasis and invasive aspergillosis as Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act (GAIN Act). We also applied to the FDA for, and were granted, Fast Track designation for ibrexafungerp for these indications. Receipt of QIDP status and Fast Track designation in practice may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA or related GAIN Act exclusivity benefits.\nDelays in the commencement, enrollment and completion of clinical trials could result in increased costs to us and delay or limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval for ibrexafungerp or any future product candidates.\nWe do not know whether our current clinical trials of ibrexafungerp will be completed on schedule or at all, or whether any future clinical trials of ibrexafungerp or any future product candidates we may seek to develop will be allowed to commence or, if commenced, will be completed on schedule or at all. The commencement, enrollment and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\ninability to reach agreements on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations, or CROs, and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022\ndifficulty identifying and engaging qualified clinical investigators;\n\u2022\nregulatory objections to commencing a clinical trial or proceeding to the next phase of investigation, including inability to reach agreement with the FDA or non-U.S. regulators regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials or for other reasons such as safety concerns that might be identified during preclinical development or early stage clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of eligible trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including some that may be for the same indication as our product candidates;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial sites from our clinical trials as a result of changing standards of care;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain institutional review board (or ethics review committee) approval to conduct a clinical trial at prospective sites;\n\u2022\ndifficulty identifying, recruiting and enrolling eligible patients to participate in clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including meeting the enrollment criteria for our study and competition from other clinical trial programs for the same indication as product candidates we seek to commercialize;\n\u2022\ninability to retain patients in clinical trials due to the treatment protocol, personal issues, side effects from the therapy or lack of efficacy;\n\u2022\ninability to produce and/or obtain in a timely manner sufficient quantity of our products to satisfy the requirements of the clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninability to enroll patients, or slow down in the rate of enrolling patients, in clinical trials due to unforeseen natural disasters, public health crises, political crises and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control, such as the recent emergence and spread of COVID-19, a coronavirus, which may cause participants to not want to participate in these trials or otherwise have any unnecessary contact with the medical community; and\n\u2022\ninability to obtain sufficient funding to commence a clinical trial.\nIn addition, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, our current or any future partners, an institutional review board, the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nfailure by us, CROs or clinical investigators to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u2022\nfailed inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nsafety or efficacy issues or any determination that a clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks. During an extension of our Phase 1 program for the intravenous formulation in healthy volunteers, aimed to expand the safety margin that would allow greater flexibility of dosing options in patients, we observed adverse events secondary to thrombi formation at site of IV infusion; or\n\u2022\nlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial due to unforeseen costs resulting from enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional trials and studies, increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties, or other reasons.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of ibrexafungerp or any future product candidates we may seek to develop, we may be delayed in obtaining, or may not be able to obtain, marketing approval for these product candidates.\nIn addition, if our current or any future partners have rights to and responsibility for development of ibrexafungerp or any future product candidates, they may fail to meet their obligations to develop and commercialize the product candidates, including clinical trials for these product candidates.\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we or any of our partners may be required by appropriate regulatory authorities to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us or any of our partners to resubmit clinical trial protocols to independent review boards for re-examination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. If we or any of our partners experience delays in the completion of, or if we or our partners terminate, clinical trials, the commercial prospects for ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop will be harmed, and our ability to generate revenue from sales of these product candidates will be prevented or delayed. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development. Because the results of earlier clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate we or our current or potential future partners advance through clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development. Clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we or our partners may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical or preclinical testing. In addition, data obtained from tests are susceptible to varying interpretations, and regulators may not interpret data as favorably as we do, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate the same results or otherwise provide adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a product candidate. Frequently, product candidates that have shown promising results in early clinical trials have subsequently suffered significant setbacks in later clinical trials. In addition, the design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product application, or approval of a supplemental application to add a new indication or other changes, and flaws or shortcomings in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. We have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support regulatory approval, or approval of supplemental applications for new indications or other changes. Further, clinical trials of potential products often reveal that it is not practical or feasible to continue development efforts. If ibrexafungerp or any future product candidates are found to be unsafe or lack efficacy, we or our collaborators will not be able to obtain regulatory approval for them and our business would be harmed. For example, if the results of our completed, ongoing or planned Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials of ibrexafungerp do not achieve, to the satisfaction of regulators, the primary efficacy endpoints and demonstrate an acceptable level of safety, the prospects for approval of ibrexafungerp would be materially and adversely affected. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including those with greater resources and experience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety and/or efficacy results between different trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including differences in trial protocols and design, differences in size and type of the patient populations, adherence to the dosing regimen and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. Further, the patients taking ibrexafungerp often have other significant medical issues, such as organ transplants, cancer or other conditions in which their immune systems are suppressed, which makes it difficult to measure the effect of ibrexafungerp in the presence of these medical issues. We do not know whether our NDA for ibreaxfungerp for the treatment of VVC will be approved, or\nwhether any Phase 2, Phase 3 or other clinical trials we or any partners may conduct will demonstrate consistent and/or adequate efficacy and safety to obtain regulatory approval to market ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop.\nWe have limited experience in conducting clinical trials and have only submitted one NDA before, and we may be unable to do so for ibrexafungerp in additional indications or any future product candidate we may seek to develop.\nMerck completed seven Phase 1 clinical trials of ibrexafungerp and we have completed 13 Phase 1 clinical trials, four Phase 2 trials, and have initiated five Phase 3 trials, two of which have been completed and three of which are ongoing. We are planning to conduct additional Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials of ibrexafungerp. The conduct of successful Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials is essential in obtaining regulatory approval, and the submission of a successful NDA is a complicated process. We have limited experience in preparing and submitting regulatory filings, have previously only sponsored four Phase 2 clinical trials and five Phase 3 clinical trials, and we have only submitted one NDA. Consequently, we may be unable to successfully and efficiently execute and complete our ongoing and planned clinical trials in a way that is acceptable to the FDA and leads to an approval of ibrexafungerp or any future product candidate we may seek to develop. We may require more time and incur greater costs than our competitors and may not succeed in obtaining regulatory approvals of product candidates that we may seek to develop. In addition, failure to commence or complete, or delays in, our planned clinical trials would prevent us from or delay us in commercializing ibrexafungerp or any future product candidate we may develop.\nThe environment in which our regulatory submissions may be reviewed changes over time, which may make it more difficult to obtain regulatory approval of any of our product candidates we may seek to develop or commercialize.\nThe environment in which regulatory submissions are reviewed changes over time. For example, average review times at the FDA for NDAs have fluctuated over the last ten years, and although we have PDUFA date for our NDA submission for ibrexafungerp for the treatment of VVC, we cannot predict the review time for any other submission with any regulatory authorities. Review times can be affected by a variety of factors, including budget and funding levels and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. Moreover, in light of widely publicized events concerning the safety risks of certain drug products, regulatory authorities, members of Congress, the Government Accountability Office, medical professionals and the general public have raised concerns about potential drug safety issues. These events have resulted in the withdrawal of drug products, revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the drug products and establishment of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies that may, for instance, restrict distribution of drug products. The increased attention to drug safety issues may result in a more cautious approach by the FDA to clinical trials. Data from preclinical studies and clinical trials may receive greater scrutiny with respect to safety, which may make the FDA or other regulatory authorities more likely to terminate clinical trials before completion, or require longer or additional clinical trials that may result in substantial additional expense, a delay or failure in obtaining approval or approval for a more limited indication or conditions of use than originally sought.\nIn addition, data obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials are subject to different interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory review or approval of product candidates. Changes in FDA personnel responsible for review of our submissions could also impact the manner in which our data are viewed. Furthermore, regulatory attitudes towards the data and results required to demonstrate safety and efficacy can change over time and can be affected by many factors, such as the emergence of new information, including information on other products, policy changes and agency funding, staffing and leadership. We do not know whether future changes to the regulatory environment will be favorable or unfavorable to our business prospects.\nIf ibrexafungerp or any other future product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval do not achieve broad market acceptance, the revenue that is generated from their sales will be limited.\nThe commercial success of ibrexafungerp or any other product candidates we may seek to develop will depend upon the acceptance of these product candidates among physicians, patients, the medical community and healthcare payors. The degree of market acceptance of product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in the FDA-approved labeling;\n\u2022\nchanges in the standard of care for the targeted indications;\n\u2022\nlimitations in the approved indications;\n\u2022\navailability of alternative therapies with potentially advantageous results, or other products with similar results at similar or lower cost, including generics and over-the-counter products;\n\u2022\nlower demonstrated clinical safety or efficacy compared to other products;\n\u2022\noccurrence of significant adverse side effects;\n\u2022\nineffective sales, marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nlack of availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from governmental health care programs, managed care plans and other third-party payors;\n\u2022\ntiming of market introduction and perceived effectiveness of competitive products;\n\u2022\nlack of cost-effectiveness;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity about our product candidates or favorable publicity about competitive products;\n\u2022\nlack of convenience and ease of administration; and\n\u2022\npotential product liability claims.\nIf ibrexafungerp or any future product candidates we may seek to develop are approved, but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, healthcare payors and patients, sufficient revenue may not be generated from these product candidates, and we may not become or remain profitable. In addition, efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nA significant use of antifungal drugs consists of treatment due to the presence of symptoms before diagnosis of the invasive fungal infections, and if recently approved diagnostic tools, or additional tools currently under development, for the quick diagnosis of invasive fungal infections are broadly used in the marketplace, the number of treatments using antifungal drugs may decrease significantly, decreasing the potential market for ibrexafungerp.\nWe believe that a large portion of the treatments using antifungal drugs are administered when symptoms of invasive fungal infections are present but a diagnosis of the infection has not yet been made, due to the rapid and potentially fatal progression of invasive fungal infections. Diagnostic tools recently approved by the FDA, or currently under development, for the rapid diagnosis of invasive fungal infections may significantly diminish the need to treat patients in advance of diagnosis of invasive fungal infections, which will reduce the potential market for ibrexafungerp in the event that we are able to obtain FDA approval of ibrexafungerp. Moreover, if a rapid and accurate test of the susceptibility of a fungal infection to generically available treatments is developed and widely adopted, the market for ibrexafungerp may suffer.\nIf resistance to ibrexafungerp develops quickly or cross-resistance with echinocandins becomes more common, our business will be harmed.\nWe recognize that, over time, resistance develops against every antibacterial and antifungal drug. One or more strains of fungal pathogens may develop resistance to ibrexafungerp more rapidly than we currently expect, either because our hypothesis of the mechanism of action is incorrect or because a strain of fungi undergoes some unforeseen genetic mutation that permits it to survive. Since we expect lower resistance relative to other antifungal drug classes to be a major factor in the commercialization of ibrexafungerp, rapid development of such resistance or development of cross resistance with echinocandins would have a major adverse impact on the acceptability and sales of ibrexafungerp.\nIf we are unable to obtain regulatory approval of both the oral and IV formulations of ibrexafungerp, ibrexafungerp may not achieve broad market acceptance and sales will be limited.\nCurrent treatment regimens for invasive fungal infections typically involve initial administration of treatments as an IV infusion, with a switch to an oral formulation of the same or a similar medication to complete the course of treatment on an out-patient basis. We believe that providing both the IV and oral formulations will be beneficial to doctors who prefer to start treatment of patients in a hospital setting with an IV therapy and then switch them to an oral formulation of the same medication. If we are unable to successfully develop and achieve regulatory approval for either the oral or IV formulation of ibrexafungerp, our lead product candidate may not achieve, or may be delayed in achieving, broad market acceptance and sales will be limited.\nOur product candidates may have undesirable side effects that may delay or prevent marketing approval, or, if approval is received, require them to be taken off the market or otherwise limit their sales.\nAlthough we have a PDUFA date for our NDA submission for ibrexafungerp for the treatment of VVC, it is impossible to predict when or if ibrexafungerp for other indications or any other product candidate we may seek to develop will prove effective or safe, or whether we will receive marketing approval for ibrexafungerp for the treatment of VVC or other indications, or for any other products we may seek to develop. Unforeseen side effects from any product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, if approved, after the product has been marketed. The most commonly reported adverse events after oral administration of ibrexafungerp have been gastrointestinal (GI) events (i.e., nausea, diarrhea, vomiting). The gastrointestinal events reported have typically been transient (i.e., short duration), mild or moderate and not leading to discontinuation. The most commonly reported adverse events after IV administration of ibrexafungerp have been local reactions at the site of infusion. During our Phase 1 IV program in healthy volunteers, aimed to expand the safety margin that would allow greater flexibility of dosing options in patients, we observed three mild-to-moderate thrombotic events in healthy volunteers receiving the IV formulation of ibrexafungerp at the highest doses and highest concentrations in a Phase 1 study. These events were reported to FDA as 15-day alert reports because they were unexpected and required anticoagulant therapy.\nThe potential contribution of the IV formulation of ibrexafungerp to these events cannot be ruled out even though rates of thrombotic events due to intravenous catheters reported in the literature are comparable to those observed in the Phase 1 study.\nSerious adverse events (SAEs) are common when conducting clinical trials in a seriously ill population such as patients experiencing invasive candidiasis. Several SAEs have been reported in our clinical trials but only four of the events have been deemed by the investigator to be potentially related to ibrexafungerp, although other contributing factors could not be ruled out. These four serious adverse events include: one event of elevation of liver function tests in a subject who received a single dose of oral ibrexafungerp (resolved) and three events secondary to thrombi formation at site of IV infusion with the cyclodextrin-based IV formulation.\nOn March 2, 2017, we announced that the FDA had placed a clinical hold on our IV formulation, instructing us to hold the initiation of any new clinical studies with our IV formulation until the FDA completes a review of all available pre-clinical and clinical data of the IV formulation of ibrexafungerp. In January 2018, we announced encouraging pre-clinical results for the prototype liposomal IV formulation of ibrexafungerp, showing improved local tolerability profile at the infusion site in head-to-head pre-clinical evaluations with the cyclodextrin-based IV formulation. In August 2018, we announced that as part of our development plans, the process for the liposomal formulation was transferred for scale-up purposes at a manufacturing site intended to provide clinical supplies. Additional preclinical evaluations were performed with the scaled-up formulation, which unexpectedly revealed differences in tolerability at the injection site, delaying advancement of the IV product into human trials. As it is generally recognized that changes to manufacturing processes and/or scale-up can impact the characteristics of drug products, particularly for more technically complex formulations such as liposomal products, we are currently working with our vendors and CMC experts to enable us to resume the pre-IND pre-clinical activities for the IV formulation of ibrexafungerp in the U.S. If the FDA does not permit us to initiate new clinical studies with our IV formulation, we will not be able to develop and commercialize an IV formulation of ibrexafungerp, which would harm our business prospects. We are currently conducting a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the IV liposomal formulation of ibrexafungerp in healthy subjects. The study is being conducted in South Africa and dosing started in March 2021.\nPreclinical findings in the future could trigger the need to evaluate or monitor for specific potential safety concerns in clinical trials. The results of our Phase 1 clinical trial in South Africa and any future clinical trials may show that ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop cause undesirable or unacceptable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, resulting in delay of, or failure to obtain, marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities, or may lead us to abandon their development altogether.\nEven if ibrexafungerp or any future product candidate we may seek to develop receives marketing approval, we or others may subsequently identify undesirable or unacceptable side effects caused by these products, in which case:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, precautions, contraindications or field alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product;\n\u2022\nwe may have limitations on how we promote the product;\n\u2022\nsales of the product may decrease significantly;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require us to take our approved product off the market;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us or our current or potential future partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenue from the sale of products.\nWe have never marketed a drug before, and if we are unable to establish an effective sales force and marketing infrastructure or enter into acceptable third-party sales and marketing or licensing arrangements, we may not be able to successfully commercialize ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop.\nWe currently do not have any sales, distribution and marketing capabilities, the development of which will require substantial resources and will be time consuming. The costs incurred in the development of these capabilities, either internally or through a third-party contract sales organization, would be incurred in advance of any approval of a product candidate. In addition, we may not be able to hire a sales force in the United States that is sufficient in size or has adequate expertise in the medical markets that we intend to target. If we are unable to establish our sales force and marketing capability, our operating results may be adversely affected. In addition, in February 2021 we entered into an agreement with Amplity, Inc., for the potential upcoming commercial launch of ibrexafungerp for the treatment of VVC in the U.S., and will utilize Amplity\u2019s\ncommercial execution expertise and resources for sales force, remote engagement, training, market access and select operation services. However, if Amplity does not perform under this agreement in the manner we expect, or Amplity were to terminate this agreement, this would significantly impair or delay our ability to commercialize ibrexafungerp for the treatment of VVC in the U.S. if approved. Further, we currently have a development license and supply agreement with R-Pharm, a leading supplier of hospital drugs in Russia, pursuant to which we license to R-Pharm rights to develop and commercialize ibrexafungerp in the field of human health in Russia and certain smaller non-core markets. We plan to enter into additional sales and marketing or licensing arrangements with third parties for international sales of any approved products. If we are unable to enter into or maintain any such arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all, or these entities fail to perform as we intend under these agreements, we may be unable to market and sell ibrexafungerp or any future product candidates we may seek to develop in these markets.\nWe expect that ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop will face competition, and most of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, with a number of established, large pharmaceutical companies, as well as many smaller companies. There are many foreign and domestic pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies and research organizations actively engaged in research and development of products that may target the same markets as ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop. We expect any products we develop to compete on the basis of, among other things, product efficacy, lack of significant adverse side effects and convenience and ease of treatment. For example, ibrexafungerp will compete against current leading antifungal drugs, including voriconazole from the azole class, caspofungin from the echinocandin class, and liposomal amphotericin B from the polyenes class, many of which are currently available in generic form, or expected to be available in generic form at the time ibrexafungerp might be approved.\nCompared to us, many of our competitors in the antifungal market have, and potential competitors for any future product candidates we may seek to develop may have, substantially greater:\n\u2022\nresources, including capital, personnel and technology;\n\u2022\nresearch and development capability;\n\u2022\nclinical trial expertise;\n\u2022\nregulatory expertise;\n\u2022\nintellectual property portfolios;\n\u2022\nexpertise in prosecution of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing and distribution expertise; and\n\u2022\nsales and marketing expertise.\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors and potential competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we do. Our competitors and potential competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more widely used and less costly than ours and may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products and maintaining compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements.\nReimbursement decisions by third-party payors may have an adverse effect on pricing and market acceptance in the United States. If there is not sufficient reimbursement for our products, it is less likely that our products will be purchased by patients and/or providers.\nSuccessful commercialization of pharmaceutical products usually depends on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including commercial insurers and federal and state healthcare programs. Patients and/or healthcare providers who purchase drugs generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with such products. As such, coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors can be essential to new product acceptance and may have an effect on pricing.\nBecause ibrexafungerp is not currently commercially available, we do not know the extent to which it will be able to obtain favorable coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors if it is approved by the FDA. If we choose to bring other product candidates to market, they will be subject to similar uncertainty. We believe that ibrexafungerp and any other product candidates that are brought to market are less likely to be purchased by patients and/or providers if they are not adequately reimbursed by third-party payors.\nIn the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Furthermore, the market for our product candidates may depend on access to third-\nparty payors\u2019 drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Industry competition to be included in such formularies results in downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies when a competing generic product is available. The adoption of certain payment methodologies by third-party payors may limit our ability to profit from the sale of ibrexafungerp. For example, under Medicare, hospitals are reimbursed under an inpatient prospective payment system. This pricing methodology provides a single payment amount to hospitals based on a given diagnosis-related group. As a result, with respect to Medicare reimbursement for services in the hospital inpatient setting, hospitals could have a financial incentive to use the least expensive drugs for the treatment of invasive fungal infections, particularly the IV formulations of these drugs, as they are typically administered in the hospital, which may significantly impact our ability to charge a premium for ibrexafungerp.\nAll third-party payors, whether governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs, including mechanisms to encourage the use of generic drugs. Congress has also considered policies to lower the reimbursement formulas in federal and state healthcare programs. Furthermore, coverage of, and reimbursement for, drugs can differ significantly from payor to payor and may require significant time and resources to obtain. In addition, new laws or regulations could impact future coverage and reimbursement.\nHealthcare policy changes, including the Affordable Care Act, or changes or repeal of the Affordable Care Act, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn recent years, there have been numerous initiatives on the federal and state levels for comprehensive reforms affecting healthcare industry, including reforms related to the payment for, the availability of and reimbursement for healthcare services in the United States, including pharmaceutical products. These initiatives have ranged from proposals to fundamentally change federal and state healthcare reimbursement programs, including providing comprehensive healthcare coverage to the public under governmental funded programs, to minor modifications to existing programs.\nIn March 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act is designed to expand access to affordable health insurance, control healthcare spending, and improve healthcare quality. The law included provisions to, among other things, tie Medicare provider reimbursement to healthcare quality and incentives, mandatory compliance programs, enhanced transparency disclosure requirements, increased funding and initiatives to address fraud and abuse, and incentives to state Medicaid programs to expand their coverage and services. It also imposed an annual tax on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell \u201cbranded prescription drugs.\u201d There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, President Trump signed several executive orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation to replace or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 included a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the Affordable Care Act-mandated \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA) among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d.\nOn December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unclear when a decision will be made or how the Supreme Court will rule. Although the Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden Administration will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business.\nFurther, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and\nenacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. For example, at the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the administration\u2019s proposals. The FDA also released a final rule, effective November 30, 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until March 22, 2021. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump\u2019s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. However, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives.\nWe cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future, particularly in light of the new presidential administration. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing, which could have a negative impact on our sales of any future approved products. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe expect that a portion of the market for ibrexafungerp and any other product candidates we may seek to develop will be outside the United States. However, our product candidates may never receive approval or be commercialized outside of the United States.\nBefore we or any commercial partners can market and commercialize any product candidates outside of the United States, there are numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries that will apply. Research and marketing authorization procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and administrative review periods. The marketing authorization process in other countries may include all of the risks detailed above regarding failure to obtain FDA approval in the United States as well as other risks. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country, or identification of potential safety concerns in one country, may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have the same adverse effects detailed above regarding FDA approval in the United States. As described above, such effects include the risks that:\n\u2022\nibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop may not generate preclinical or clinical data that are deemed sufficient by regulators in a given jurisdiction;\n\u2022\nibrexafungerp may not be approved for all indications requested, or any indications at all, in a given jurisdiction which could limit the uses of ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop and have an adverse effect on product sales and potential royalties; and\n\u2022\nsuch approval in a given jurisdiction may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or require costly post-marketing follow-up studies.\nForeign countries may have requirements for marketing authorization holders or distributors to have a legal or physical presence in that country, and consideration of and compliance with these requirements may result in additional time and expense before we can pursue or obtain marketing authorization in foreign jurisdictions. If we do receive approval in other countries, we may enter into sales and marketing arrangements with third parties for international sales of any approved products.\nEven if ibrexafungerp or any other future product candidates we may seek to develop receive regulatory approval, we may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if regulatory approval is obtained for ibrexafungerp or any other future product candidates we may seek to develop, regulatory authorities may still impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies. Given the number of high profile adverse events with certain drug products, regulatory authorities may require, as a condition of approval, costly risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, which may include safety surveillance, restricted distribution and use, patient education, enhanced labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials and restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising. For example, any labeling approved for any of our product candidates may include a restriction on the term of its use, or it may not include one or more intended indications. Furthermore, any new legislation addressing drug safety issues could result in delays or\nincreased costs during the period of product development, clinical trials and regulatory review and approval, as well as increased costs to assure compliance with any new post-approval regulatory requirements. Any of these restrictions or requirements could force us or our partners to conduct costly studies.\nIbrexafungerp and any other future product candidates we may seek to develop will also be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for the packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information on the drug. In addition, approved products, manufacturers and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). As such, we and our contract manufacturers, which we will be responsible for overseeing and monitoring for compliance, are subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control. The FDA may hold us responsible for any deficiencies or noncompliance of our contract manufacturers in relation to ibrexafungerp and any other future product candidates we may seek to develop. Failure to follow cGMP can result in products being deemed adulterated, which carries significant legal implications. We will also be required to engage in pharmacovigilance activities and report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotion for products. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved label. As such, we may not promote products for indications or uses for which they do not have approval. Failure to comply with FDA advertising and promotion standards, which are often subject to interpretation by regulators, may result in a wide range of exposure and liability for us.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured or disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of a product, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If the manufacturing or marketing of products fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022\nissue warning letters;\n\u2022\nmandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u2022\nrequire us or our partners to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022\nimpose other civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspend regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, our partners or our potential future partners;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022\nseize or detain products or require a product recall.\nNon-compliance may also open a company to potential whistleblower lawsuits and the potential for liability under the False Claims Act.\nPharmaceutical companies are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight, which may result in significant additional expense and limit our ability to commercialize our products.\nWe are subject to regulation by other regional, national, state and local agencies, including the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other regulatory bodies. Violations of any of such laws and regulations could result in significant penalties being assessed against us.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, clarified that a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it, in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act amended the federal civil False Claims Act to provide that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors\nprotecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, however, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny.\nThe federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties law, prohibit any person from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment of government funds that are false or fraudulent or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Many pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under these laws for a variety of alleged marketing activities, including providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; providing consulting fees, grants, free travel, and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe the company\u2019s products; and inflating prices reported to private price publication services, which are used to set drug payment rates under government healthcare programs. Companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the marketing of their products for unapproved uses and have also been prosecuted on other legal theories of Medicare and Medicaid fraud.\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private). Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity need not have actual knowledge the statute or specific intent to violate it, in order to have committed a violation.\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their implementing regulations, which impose certain obligations with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on \u201ccovered entities,\u201d such as certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses and their respective \u201cbusiness associates,\u201d as well as their covered subcontractors, that perform services for them, which involve the creation, receipt, use, maintenance, transmission or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity.\nThe Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the Affordable Care Act, which require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding its payments and other transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year.\nThe majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to these laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers. In addition, certain states, including California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts, require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. Certain states also require pharmaceutical companies to file periodic reports with the state on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and/or other activities, and/or register their sales and medical representatives.\nCompliance with various federal and state laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that violate them may face substantial penalties. The potential sanctions include significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, including monetary fines, exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, disgorgement, criminal fines, imprisonment, contractual damage, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Because of the breadth of these laws and the lack of extensive legal guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions, it is possible that some of our business activities or those of our commercial partners could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws. Such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and growth prospects.\nWe could become subject to government investigations and related subpoenas. Such subpoenas are often associated with previously filed qui tam actions, or lawsuits filed under seal under the federal civil False Claims Act. Qui tam actions are brought by private plaintiffs suing on behalf of the federal government for alleged federal civil False Claims Act violations. The time and expense associated with responding to such subpoenas, and any related qui tam or other actions may be extensive, and we cannot predict the results of our review of the responsive documents and underlying facts or the results of such actions. Responding to government investigations, defending any claims raised, and any resulting fines, restitution, damages and penalties, settlement payments or administrative actions, as well as any related actions brought by stockholders or other third parties, could have a material impact on our reputation, business and financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business.\nThe number and complexity of both federal and state laws continues to increase, and additional governmental resources are being added to enforce these laws and to prosecute companies and individuals who are believed to be violating them. In particular, the Affordable Care Act includes a number of provisions aimed at strengthening the government\u2019s ability to pursue federal Anti-Kickback Statute and federal False Claims Act cases against pharmaceutical manufacturers and other healthcare entities, including substantially increased funding for healthcare fraud enforcement activities, enhanced investigative powers, and amendments to the federal civil False Claims Act that make it easier for the government and whistleblowers to pursue cases for alleged kickback and false claim violations. Responding to a government investigation or enforcement action would be expensive and time-consuming and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and growth prospects.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable federal, state, or local regulatory requirements, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions that could affect our ability to commercialize our products and could harm or prevent sales of any affected products that we are able to commercialize, or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing our products. Any threatened or actual government enforcement action could also generate adverse publicity and require that we devote substantial resources that could otherwise be used in other aspects of our business.\nRegulations, guidelines and recommendations published by various government agencies and organizations may affect the use of ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop.\nGovernment agencies may issue regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us, our partners or our potential future partners and our product candidates. In addition, professional societies, practice management groups, private health/science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to the healthcare and patient communities. These various sorts of recommendations may relate to such matters as product usage, dosage, and route of administration and use of related or competing therapies. Changes to these recommendations or other guidelines advocating alternative therapies could result in decreased use of ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe are dependent on our existing third-party collaboration with Amplity, Inc. to commercialize ibrexafungerp for the treatment of VVC in the U.S., and if Amplity is not successful in commercializing ibrexafungerp in the U.S., we may not be successful in commercializing ibrexafungerp in the U.S.\nIn February 2021, we entered into an agreement with Amplity, Inc., for the potential upcoming commercial launch of ibrexafungerp for the treatment of VVC in the U.S., and will utilize Amplity\u2019s commercial execution expertise and resources for sales force, remote engagement, training, market access and select operation services. However, if Amplity does not perform under this agreement in the manner we expect, or Amplity were to terminate this agreement, this would significantly impair or delay our ability to commercialize ibrexafungerp for the treatment of VVC in the U.S. if approved.\nWe are dependent on our existing third-party collaboration with Hansoh to commercialize ibrexafungerp in the Greater China region, and if Hansoh is not successful in commercializing ibrexafungerp in these areas, we will lose a significant source of potential revenue.\nWe currently have an exclusive license and collaboration agreement with Hansoh who will pay us milestone payments upon the achievement of specified development and commercial milestones. In addition, Hansoh will pay us royalties upon sales of ibrexafungerp by Hansoh. We are relying on Hansoh to commercialize ibrexafungerp in the Greater China area, including mainland chaina, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, and if Hansoh is not able to commercialize ibrexafungerp in those countries, or determines not to pursue commercialization of ibrexafungerp in those countries, we will not receive any milestone or royalty payments under the agreement.\nWe are dependent on our existing third-party collaboration with R-Pharm to commercialize ibrexafungerp in the Russian Federation and certain other countries, and if R-Pharm is not successful in commercializing ibrexafungerp in those countries, we will lose a significant source of potential revenue.\nWe currently have a development license and supply agreement with R-Pharm, a leading supplier of hospital drugs in Russia, pursuant to which we license to R-Pharm rights to develop and commercialize ibrexafungerp in the field of human health in Russia and certain smaller non-core markets. R-Pharm will pay us milestone payments upon the achievement of specified milestones, including registration of ibrexafungerp in a country and upon the achievement of specified levels of sales. In addition, R-Pharm will pay us royalties upon sales of ibrexafungerp by R-Pharm. We are relying on R-Pharm to commercialize ibrexafungerp in the countries covered by our agreement with it, and if R-Pharm is not able to commercialize ibrexafungerp in those countries, or determines not to pursue commercialization of ibrexafungerp in those countries, we will not receive any milestone or royalty payments under the agreement.\nWe may not be successful in establishing and maintaining development and commercialization collaborations, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval, establishing manufacturing capabilities and marketing approved products is expensive. Consequently, a portion of our strategy is to license to third parties rights to develop and commercialize product candidates, including candidates we have discovered other than ibrexafungerp, and if these third parties do not perform under our agreements with them, we will not receive any revenue from these collaborations. For example, we currently have a development license and supply agreement with R-Pharm, pursuant to which we license to R-Pharm rights to develop and commercialize ibrexafungerp in the field of human health in Russia and certain smaller non-core markets, and if ibrexafungerp receives marketing approval, we may enter into additional sales and marketing arrangements with third parties for international sales. If we are unable to enter into any of these arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to market and sell ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop in certain markets. We expect to face competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Moreover, collaboration arrangements are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement and they may require substantial resources to maintain. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements for the development of product candidates. When we partner with a third party for development and commercialization of a product candidate, we can expect to relinquish to the third party some or all of the control over the future success of that product candidate. Our collaboration partner may not devote sufficient resources to the commercialization of product candidates or may otherwise fail in their commercialization. The terms of any collaboration or other arrangement that we establish may not be favorable to us. In addition, any collaboration that we enter into may be unsuccessful in the development and commercialization of product candidates. In some cases, we may be responsible for continuing preclinical and initial clinical development of a partnered product candidate or research program, and the payment we receive from our collaboration partner may be insufficient to cover the cost of this development. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators for product candidates, we could face increased costs, we may be forced to limit the number of product candidates we can commercially develop or the territories in which we commercialize them and we might fail to commercialize products or programs for which a suitable collaborator cannot be found. If we fail to achieve successful collaborations, our operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on third-party contractors for a substantial portion of our drug development activities and may not be able to control their work as effectively as if we performed these functions ourselves.\nWe outsource, and intend to continue to outsource, substantial portions of our drug development activities to third-party service providers, including manufacturing and the conduct of our clinical trials and various preclinical studies. Our agreements with third-party service providers and CROs are and will be on a study-by-study basis and typically short-term. In all cases, we expect to be able to terminate the agreements with notice and be responsible for the supplier\u2019s previously incurred costs.\nBecause we rely on third parties, our internal capacity to perform these functions is limited. Outsourcing these functions involves risk that third parties may not perform to our standards, may not produce results in a timely manner or may fail to perform at all. Even if we outsource activities, in most cases regulators will hold us responsible for the compliance of the activities performed, and hold us responsible for oversight and monitoring of the activities. In addition, the use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated. There are a limited number of third-party service providers that have the expertise required to achieve our business objectives. Identifying, qualifying and managing performance of third-party service providers can be difficult and time consuming and could cause delays in our development programs. We currently have a small number of employees devoted to clinical development activities, which limits the internal resources we have available to identify and monitor our third-party providers. To the extent we are unable to identify, retain and successfully manage the performance of third-party service providers in the future, our business may be adversely affected.\nAs we do not intend to own or operate facilities for manufacturing, storage and distribution of drug substance or drug product we are and will be dependent on third parties for the manufacture of ibrexafungerp. If we experience problems with any of these third parties, the commercial manufacturing of ibrexafungerp could be delayed.\nIf ibrexafungerp is approved, the inability to manufacture sufficient commercial supplies of the drug product could adversely affect product commercialization. We do not currently have any agreements with third-party manufacturers for the long-term commercial supply of ibrexafungerp. We may encounter technical difficulties or delays in the transfer of ibrexafungerp manufacturing on a commercial scale to a third-party manufacturer, or may be unable to enter into agreements for commercial supply with third-party manufacturers, or may be unable to do so on acceptable terms.\nWe may not be able to establish additional sources of supply for ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop. These suppliers are subject to regulatory requirements covering manufacturing, testing, quality control and record keeping relating to product candidates and are also subject to ongoing inspections by the regulatory agencies. Failure by any of our suppliers to comply with applicable regulations may result in long delays and interruptions to our product candidate supply while we seek to secure another supplier that meets all regulatory requirements.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates ourselves, including:\n\u2022\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing agreements or violation of regulatory standards by the third parties because of factors beyond our control;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreements by the third parties because of our breach of the manufacturing agreement or based on their own business priorities; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility of unforeseen natural disasters, public health crises, political crises and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control impacting our third parties, such as the recent emergence and spread of COVID-19, a coronavirus, which may cause delays in the ability of our suppliers to provide us with supplies on a timely basis.\nAny of these factors could result in delays or higher costs in connection with our clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop.\nIf we fail to establish or lose our relationships with CROs, our drug development efforts could be delayed.\nWe are substantially dependent on third-party vendors and CROs for preclinical studies and clinical trials related to our drug discovery and development efforts. If we fail to establish or lose our relationship with any one or more of these providers, we could experience a significant delay in both identifying another comparable provider and then contracting for its services, which could adversely affect our development efforts. We may be unable to retain an alternative provider on reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we locate an alternative provider, it is likely that this provider will need additional time to respond to our needs and may not provide the same type or level of services as the original provider. In addition, any contract research organization that we retain will be subject to the FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements and similar foreign standards and we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by these providers. Consequently, if these practices and standards are not adhered to by these providers, the development and commercialization of ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop could be delayed, which could severely harm our business and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nWe were dependent on Merck for the establishment of our intellectual property rights related to ibrexafungerp, and if Merck did not establish our intellectual property rights with sufficient scope to protect ibrexafungerp, we may have limited or no ability to assert intellectual property rights to ibrexafungerp.\nUnder our agreement with Merck, Merck was responsible for establishing the intellectual property rights to ibrexafungerp. As we were not responsible for the establishment of our intellectual property rights to ibrexafungerp, we have less visibility into the strength of our intellectual property rights to ibrexafungerp than if we had been responsible for the establishment of these rights. If Merck did not establish those rights such that they are of sufficient scope to protect ibrexafungerp, then we may not be able to prevent others from using or commercializing ibrexafungerp, and others may be able to assert intellectual property rights in ibrexafungerp and prevent us from further pursuing the development and commercialization of ibrexafungerp.\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop and the methods used to manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop is dependent upon the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No absolute policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in the United States or in many foreign jurisdictions. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and foreign jurisdictions may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be enforced in the patents that we currently own or that may be issued from the applications we have filed or may file in the future or that we have licensed or may license from third parties, including Merck for ibrexafungerp. Further, if any patents we obtain or license are deemed invalid or unenforceable, it could impact our ability to commercialize or license our technology.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022\nothers may be able to make compounds that are similar to ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop but that are not covered by the claims of our patents;\n\u2022\nif we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market our drug candidates under patent protection would be reduced;\n\u2022\nwe might not have been the first to conceive, make or disclose the inventions covered by our patents or pending patent applications;\n\u2022\nwe might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022\nany patents that we obtain may be invalid or unenforceable or otherwise may not provide us with any competitive advantages; or\n\u2022\nthe patents of others may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDue to the patent laws of a country, or the decisions of a patent examiner in a country, or our own filing strategies, we may not obtain patent coverage for all of the product candidates that may be disclosed or methods involving these candidates that may be disclosed in the parent patent application. We plan to pursue divisional patent applications and/or continuation patent applications in the United States and many other countries to obtain claim coverage for inventions that were disclosed but not claimed in the parent patent application, but may not succeed in these efforts.\nComposition of matter patents on the active pharmaceutical ingredient are generally considered to be the strongest form of intellectual property protection for pharmaceutical products, as such patents generally provide protection without regard to any method of use. We cannot be certain that the claims in our patent applications covering composition-of-matter of our drug candidates will be considered patentable by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) courts in the United States or by the patent offices and courts in foreign countries. Method of use patents protect the use of a product for the method recited in the claims. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products \u201coff-label.\u201d Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to or induce the infringement of method of use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute. Interference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our collaborators or licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Litigation, interference, or derivation proceedings may fail, resulting in harm to our business, and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, licensees, licensors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information such that our competitors may obtain it. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, such as new therapies, including therapies for the indications we are targeting. If others seek to develop similar therapies, their research and development efforts may inhibit our ability to conduct research in certain areas and to expand our intellectual property portfolio, and also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights and we may be unable to enforce or protect our rights to, or use, our technology.\nIf we choose to go to court to stop another party from using the inventions claimed in any patents we obtain, that individual or company has the right to ask the court to rule that such patents are invalid or should not be enforced. These lawsuits are expensive and would consume time and resources and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel even if we were successful in stopping the infringement of such patents or sustaining their validity and enforceability. In addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that such patents are not valid or that we do not have the right to enforce them. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the other party on the grounds that such other party\u2019s activities do not infringe such patents. In addition, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Supreme Court of the United States continue to address issues under the United States patent laws, and the decisions of those and other courts could adversely affect our ability to sustain the validity of our issued or licensed patents and obtain new patents.\nFurthermore, a third party may claim that we or our manufacturing or commercialization partners or customers are using inventions covered by the third party\u2019s patent rights and may go to court to stop us or our partners and/or customers from engaging in our operations and activities, including making or selling ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may\nseek to develop. These lawsuits are costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide that we or our commercialization partners or customers are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and would order us or our partners or customers to stop the activities covered by the patents. In that event, we or our commercialization partners or customers may not have a viable way around the patent and may need to halt commercialization or use of the relevant product. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us or our partners or customers to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party\u2019s patents or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and expense. We cannot predict whether any license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our drug candidates, and we have done so from time to time. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In such events, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of our drug candidates, which could harm our business significantly. In the future, we may agree to indemnify our commercial partners and/or customers against certain intellectual property infringement claims brought by third parties which could increase our financial expense, increase our involvement in litigation and/or otherwise materially adversely affect our business.\nBecause of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation, which could adversely affect our intellectual property rights and our business. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity or unenforceability is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents.\nBecause some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing, because searches and examinations of patent applications by the USPTO and other patent offices may not be comprehensive, and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our patents or pending applications. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications and may have obtained patents covering technology similar to ours. Any such patents or patent application may have priority over our patent applications, which could further require us to obtain or license rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has obtained a U.S. patent or filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in a proceeding before the USPTO or in the courts to determine which patent or application has priority. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our application or patent could be determined not to have priority, which could adversely affect our intellectual property rights and business.\nWe have received confidential and proprietary information from collaborators, prospective licensees and other third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have improperly used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees. If we are not successful, our ability to continue our operations and our business could be materially, adversely affected.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations, on our ability to hire or retain employees, or otherwise on our business.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nWe may not be able to manage our business effectively if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified management, finance, scientific and clinical personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. Stock-based awards are critical to our ability to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled talent. However, the trading price of our common stock as listed on the Nasdaq Global Market has traded at or below the exercise price of a significant portion of the stock options currently held by our executive officers and key employees. This may reduce the retention value of these options and\nwe may need to grant additional stock options, make further amendments to the terms of existing option awards, or provide alternative compensation and retention programs to continue to retain our employees, especially our key employees and executive officers. If we are not able to attract and retain necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy. If we are unable to retain our current executive officers and key employees our ability to implement our business strategy successfully could be seriously harmed.\nWe may need to expand our operations and increase the size of our company, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nAs of March 1, 2021, we had 38 employees. If the FDA approves our NDA for ibrexafungerp for the treatment of VVC, as we expect to occur in June 2021, we will need to increase our marketing, sales and administrative headcount to manage the commercialization of ibrexafungerp for the treatment of VVC. Further, as we advance ibrexafungerp through preclinical studies, clinical trials and commercialization for other indications, we will need to increase our product development, scientific, marketing, sales and administrative headcount to manage these efforts. Our management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Our need to effectively manage our operations, growth and various projects requires that we:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully attract and recruit new employees with the expertise and experience we will require;\n\u2022\nmanage our clinical programs effectively, which we anticipate being conducted at numerous clinical sites;\n\u2022\ndevelop a marketing and sales infrastructure; and\n\u2022\ncontinue to develop our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage this growth, our business may be adversely affected.\nOther Risks Relating to Our Business\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for a product candidate and may have to limit its commercialization.\nThe use of product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we may obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims may be brought against us or our partners by participants enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against any such claims, we would incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ntermination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u2022\ncosts of related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for product candidates and loss of revenue;\n\u2022\nimpairment of our business reputation;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize product candidates.\nWe have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials domestically and in selected foreign countries where we are conducting clinical trials. Our coverage is currently limited to $10.0 million per occurrence and $10.0 million in the aggregate per year, as well as additional local country product liability coverage for trials conducted outside of the United States as required by the local country regulations. As such, our insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to product liability. We intend to expand our insurance coverage for products to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for product candidates, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash available to develop ibrexafungerp and any future product candidates we may seek to develop and adversely affect our business.\nOur internal computer systems, or those used by our contract research organizations or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contract research organizations and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage, data leakage and security breaches from computer viruses, unauthorized access, social engineering, the acts or omissions of our workforce or others with authorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we are not aware of the occurrence of any such system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our or other contractors or consultants\u2019 operations, it could result in a material disruption of our product candidate development programs. For example, the loss of clinical study data from completed or ongoing clinical studies for a product candidate could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of any product candidates could be delayed.\nOur insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which will leave us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities.\nWe do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. Some of the policies we currently maintain include general liability, employment practices liability, property, auto, workers\u2019 compensation, products liability and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance. We do not know, however, if we will be able to maintain existing insurance with adequate levels of coverage. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our cash position and results of operations.\nOur research and development activities could be affected or delayed as a result of possible restrictions on animal testing.\nCertain laws and regulations require us to test our product candidates on animals before initiating clinical trials involving humans. Animal testing activities have been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity. Animal rights groups and other organizations and individuals have attempted to stop animal testing activities by pressing for legislation and regulation in these areas and by disrupting these activities through protests and other means. To the extent the activities of these groups are successful, our research and development activities may be interrupted, delayed or become more expensive.\nU.S. and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations may impose additional liabilities on us.\nU.S. federal and state privacy and data security laws and regulations regulate how we and our partners collect, use and share certain information. For example, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and its implementing regulations, impose certain obligations with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on \u201ccovered entities,\u201d such as certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses and their respective \u201cbusiness associates\u201d that perform services for them. State security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and other state privacy laws also impose requirements regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information. In addition, in June 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) which became effective January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents the right to access and require deletion of their personal information, the right to opt out of certain personal information sharing, and the right to detailed information about how their personal information is collected, used, and disclosed. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Although the CCPA includes exemptions for certain clinical trials data and data collected pursuant to HIPAA, the law may increase our compliance costs and potential liability with respect to other personal information we collect about California residents. The CCPA has prompted a wave of proposals for new federal and state privacy legislation that, if passed, could increase our potential liability, increase our compliance costs, and adversely affect our business.\nWe may also be subject to or affected by foreign laws and regulations, including regulatory guidance, governing the collection, use, disclosure, security, transfer, and storage of personal data, such as information that we collect about patients in connection with clinical trials and our other operations abroad. The global legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. This evolution may create uncertainty in our business, result in liability, or impose additional costs on us. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future.\nFor example, the EU implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) a broad data protection framework that expands the scope of EU data protection law to include certain non-European Union entities that process the personal data of EU residents, including clinical trial data. The GDPR increases our compliance burden with respect to data protection, including by mandating potentially burdensome documentation requirements and granting certain rights to individuals to control how we collect, use, disclose, retain and protect information about them. The processing of sensitive personal data, such as information about health conditions, leads to heightened compliance burdens under the GDPR and is a topic of active\ninterest among EU regulators. In addition, the GDPR provides for breach reporting requirements, more robust regulatory enforcement and fines of up to the greater of 20 million euros or 4% of annual global revenue. The GDPR increases our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, including in clinical trials, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, which could divert management\u2019s attention and increase our cost of doing business.\nA data security breach or other privacy violation that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the personal information of our clinical trials participants, collaborators or employees could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with U.S. or international breach notification laws, subject us to mandatory corrective action, and otherwise subject us to liability under U.S. or foreign laws and regulations. Data breaches or other security incidents could also compromise our trade secrets or other intellectual property. If we are unable to prevent such data security breaches and security incidents or implement satisfactory remedial measures, our operations could be disrupted, and we may suffer reputational harm, financial loss or other regulatory penalties. In addition, such events can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm. While we have implemented security measures designed to protect our information technology systems, such measures may not prevent such events.\nFinally, it is possible that these privacy laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state, or foreign laws or self-regulatory standards could result in negative publicity, diversion of management time and effort, and proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. If we expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional privacy and data protection laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business.\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile. The following factors, in addition to other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022\nwhether or not our NDA for ibrexafungerp for the treatment of VVC is approved, denied or delayed by the FDA;\n\u2022\nthe results of our preclinical testing or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain additional funding;\n\u2022\nany delay in submitting an NDA or similar foreign applications for ibrexafungerp and any future product candidate we may seek to develop or any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the FDA\u2019s review of that NDA or a foreign regulator\u2019s review of a similar applications;\n\u2022\nmaintenance of our existing collaborations or ability to enter into new collaborations;\n\u2022\nour collaboration partners\u2019 election to develop or commercialize product candidates under our collaboration agreements or the termination of any programs under our collaboration agreements;\n\u2022\nany intellectual property infringement actions in which we or our licensors and collaboration partners may become involved;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully develop and commercialize future product candidates;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to future products;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory decisions;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products, services or technologies by our competitors;\n\u2022\nachievement of financial projections we may provide to the public;\n\u2022\nachievement of the estimates and projections of the investment community;\n\u2022\nthe perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us, our collaboration partners or our competitors;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nlegislation or regulation that mandates or encourages the use of generic products;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the U.S. equity markets;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us, our executive officers and directors or our stockholders in the future; and\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock.\nIn addition, companies trading in the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Global Market in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. These sales may also result in new investors gaining rights superior to our existing stockholders. For example, in March 2019 and April 2020, we issued and sold $16 million and $10 million, respectively, of 6.0% convertible senior notes. The holders may convert their convertible notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2025 (for the notes issued in March 2019) and April 15, 2026 (for the notes issued in April 2020). Upon conversion of the convertible notes by a holder, the holder will receive shares of our common stock, together, if applicable, with cash in lieu of any fractional share. Holders who convert may also be entitled to receive, under certain circumstances, an interest make-whole payment payable in shares of common stock. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date, we will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its convertible notes in connection with such a corporate event. To the extent holders of these notes convert the notes, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us, including the ability of our board of directors to establish new series of preferred stock and issue shares of these new series, which could be used by our board of directors to oppose a hostile takeover attempt, which some stockholders may believe would be in the best interests of stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management, including the elimination of cumulative voting, inability of our stockholders to call special meetings or take action by written consent, ability of our board of directors to fill board vacancies, and ability of our board of directors to determine the size of the board of directors. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. Finally, our charter documents establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings. Although we believe these provisions together provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.\nSales of our common stock to Aspire Capital may cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and the sale of the shares of our common stock acquired by Aspire Capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe may issue and sell to Aspire Capital from time to time pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement an aggregate amount of up to $20.0 million of shares of common stock. It is anticipated that shares offered to Aspire Capital will be sold over a period of up to 30 months from April 2020.

After Aspire Capital has acquired shares under the common stock purchase agreement, it may sell all, some or none of those shares. Sales to Aspire Capital by us pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement may result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our\ncommon stock to Aspire Capital in this offering, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales. However, we have the right to control the timing and amount of any sales of our shares to Aspire Capital and the common stock purchase agreement may be terminated by us at any time at our discretion without any cost to us.\nWe have a right to sell up to 25,000 purchase shares per day under our common stock purchase agreement with Aspire Capital, which total may be increased by mutual agreement up to an additional 200,000 purchase shares per day. The extent to which we rely on Aspire Capital as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors, including the prevailing market price of our common stock and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources. The aggregate number of shares that we can sell to Aspire Capital under the common stock purchase agreement may in no case exceed 1,956,547 shares of our common stock (which is equal to approximately 19.99% of the common stock outstanding on the date of the common stock purchase agreement), including the 70,910 commitment shares (the Exchange Cap), unless either (a) shareholder approval is obtained to issue more, in which case the Exchange Cap will not apply, or (b) the average purchase price of all shares sold under the common stock purchase agreement exceeds $8.461; provided that at no time shall Aspire Capital (together with its affiliates) beneficially own more than 19.99% of our common stock.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, in regions where we or third parties on which we rely have significant concentrations of clinical trial sites, manufacturing facilities, or other business operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, in regions where we or third parties on which we rely have significant concentrations of clinical trial sites, manufacturing facilities, or other business operations. We have a significant number of clinical trial sites in countries that have been directly affected by COVID-19, and depend on manufacturing operations for various stages of our supply chain in countries affected by COVID-19. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, our activities dependent on regulatory authorities, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely.", "PERMNO": 14668, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "SCYX"}
