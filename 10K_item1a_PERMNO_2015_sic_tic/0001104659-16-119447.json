{"cik": "3116", "company": "AKORN INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-05-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider each of the risks described below before purchasing shares of our common stock. The risk factors set forth below are not the only risks that may affect our business. Our business could also be affected by additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could materially suffer. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Restatement.\nOur history includes failures to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC, which, if compliance is not gained and retained, could result in the potential delisting of our common stock from The NASDAQ Global Select Market, which would materially and adversely affect our stock price, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nWe did not file our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015 nor did we timely report our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and such filings have been integrated into this comprehensive Form 10-K. These failures to timely file periodic reports with the SEC for 2015 resulted in our not being in compliance with relevant NASDAQ Listing Rules. In addition to filing this form 10-K, we are required to, among other things, file a definitive proxy statement and hold a 2016 annual meeting of shareholders. Our historical failure to file periodic reports means that we are not able to definitively predict timely prospective filings in accordance with listing rules. If we fail to accurately and timely make such filings, our stock may be delisted from The NASDAQ Global Select Market, which could have a material adverse effect on us by, among other things, reducing:\n\u00b7 The liquidity of our common stock;\n\u00b7 The market price of our common stock;\n\u00b7 The number of institutional and other investors that will consider investing in our common stock;\n\u00b7 The number of market makers in our common stock;\n\u00b7 The availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our common stock;\n\u00b7 The number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common stock;\n\u00b7 Our ability to obtain equity financing for the continuation of our operations;\n\u00b7 Our ability to use our equity as consideration in any merger transaction; and\n\u00b7 The effectiveness of equity-based compensation plans for our employees used to attract and retain individuals important to our operations\nOur historical failure to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC has, among other things, resulted in a default under our convertible note, a breach of covenants under our loan agreements and could further impact our credit rating, each of which could materially and adversely affect our prospective financial condition and/or results of operations.\nWe did not timely report our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ending March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015 nor did we timely report our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2015 and such filings have been integrated into this comprehensive Form 10-K. Any failure to make timely filings of one or more future periodic reports could result in further defaults and breaches and further negatively impact our credit rating, each of which could have an adverse impact on our ability to finance in the future, the cost of future financings, and/or our results of operations. For further information, see Risk Factor \u201cOne of our credit ratings was downgraded in November of 2015, which could adversely affect our access to liquidity, working capital, financing in the future, and could increase financing costs.\u201d\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if we otherwise fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, timely file our periodic reports, maintain our reporting status or prevent fraud.\nIn connection with our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, we concluded there were certain material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. See Item 9A - \u201cControls and Procedures.\u201d Our management or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify other material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. The existence of internal control material weaknesses may result in current and potential stockholders losing confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business, the market price of our common stock, and our ability to retain our current, or obtain new, alliance and collaboration agreements\u2019 partners. In addition, the existence of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may affect our ability to timely file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). The inability to timely file periodic reports could result in the SEC revoking the registration of our common stock, which would prohibit us from listing or having our stock quoted on The NASDAQ Global Select Market or any other stock exchange. This would have an adverse effect on our business and stock price by limiting the publicly available information regarding us and greatly reducing the ability of our stockholders to sell or trade our common stock.\nThe restatement of our previously issued 2014 financial statements and the previous delay in our filing of 2015 financial statements has resulted in various governmental investigations and shareholder lawsuits and could result in government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows.\nThe restatement of our previously issued 2014 financial statements and the previous delay in our filing of 2015 financial statements has resulted in various governmental investigations and shareholder lawsuits. See Note 22, \u201cLegal Proceedings - Shareholder and Derivative Litigation\u201d and \u201c- Other Matters.\u201d Litigation Our management may be required to devote significant time and attention to these matters, and these and additional matters that arise from the restatement, any of which could result in government enforcement actions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. We cannot predict the outcome of these matters or estimate the potential exposure at this time.\nManagement\u2019s attention and focus has been on the restatement of 2014 financial information and the remediation of our failure to file periodic reports timely which has reduced focus on operations.\nAs a direct result of the restatement and investigation into the circumstances of the restatement, our management has devoted significant time and attention to the restatement, the review of accounting procedures and errors, the audit of our financial statements, remedial actions and related matters, and it will continue to devote significant time and attention to these and additional matters that arise from the restatement. This attention diverts management focus from other matters, and could have an adverse impact on our results of prospective operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows as a result.\nWe have incurred significant additional costs to complete the restatement of previously issued financials and to remediate our failure to timely file our periodic reports, which may result in reduced operating results in future periods.\nAs part of this Form 10-K, we have completed the process of restating previously filed financial statements, and we are in the process of remediating our previously existing material weaknesses, and evaluating if further remedial action is appropriate. These restatements, and the review of the misstatements that necessitated the restatement of our financial statements, have been time consuming, expensive and could expose us to a number of additional risks, which could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn particular, we have incurred and will likely continue to incur significant expense, including significant audit, legal, consulting, and other professional fees, and lender and noteholder consent fees, in connection with the restatement of our previously issued financial statements and the ongoing remediation of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We have taken a number of steps, including adding significant internal resources and implementing a number of additional procedures, in order to strengthen our accounting function and attempt to reduce the risk of additional\nmisstatements in our financial statements. To the extent these steps are not successful, we could be forced to incur additional time and expense.\nOur historical failure to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC may limit us from accessing the public markets to raise debt or equity capital, which may limit our ability to access debt capital financing, which in turn may limit our ability to pursue one of our core strategies of acquisitions.\nWe did not file our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015 nor did we timely report our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and such filings have been integrated into this comprehensive Form 10-K. Any failure by us to make timely filings of one or more of our periodic reports for 2016 or other failure to remain current in our reporting requirements with the SEC, may inhibit our ability to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital. The inability to access the capital may limit our options to finance our business, and may substantially limit our ability to finance potential acquisitions. One of our core business strategies is to acquire complementary businesses in order to grow our company. This limited ability to access the public markets would prevent us from pursuing transactions or implementing business strategies that we believe would be beneficial to our business. As needs arise, we may seek additional borrowings or alternative sources of financing; however, difficulties in borrowing money or raising financing could have a material adverse effect on our operations, planned capital expenditures and ability to fund further growth.\nOne of our credit ratings was downgraded in November of 2015, which could adversely affect our access to liquidity, working capital, and financing in the future, and could increase financing costs.\nNationally recognized credit rating organizations have issued credit ratings relating to our long-term debt. In 2015, our credit rating with S&P was downgraded from \u201cB+\u201d to \u201cB.\u201d Our current long-term credit ratings are \u201cB1\u201d with Moody\u2019s and \u201cB\u201d with S&P, both of which are below investment grade. Additional rating agency reviews could result in a further change in outlook or downgrade. Our credit ratings could limit our access to new financing in the future, particularly short-term financing; result in an increase in financing costs, including interest expense under our debt instruments and result in less favorable covenants and financial terms of our financing arrangements.\nThis downgrade to our credit rating could reduce our flexibility with respect to working capital. Changes in our credit profile could affect the way that suppliers view our ability to make payments and could result in less favorable payment terms, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our working capital. We have significant working capital needs, as the nature of our business requires us to purchase and maintain inventories that enable us to fulfill wholesaler and retailer demand. We finance our working capital needs primarily through cash flow from our operations but may require borrowings under our Existing and Incremental Term Loan facilities. If we are unable to finance our working capital needs on the same terms going forward, or if our working capital requirements increase and we are unable to finance the increase, we may not be able to purchase or manufacture products required by our customers, which could result in a loss of sales and additional liabilities due to various contractual penalties.\nRisks Related to Our Business.\nWe depend on a small number of wholesalers to distribute our products, the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA small number of large wholesale drug distributors account for a significant portion of our gross sales, net revenues and accounts receivable. The following three wholesalers - Amerisource, Cardinal and McKesson - accounted for approximately 77.8% of total gross sales and 70.0% of total net revenues in 2015, and 82.8% of gross trade receivables as of December 31, 2015. In addition to acting as distributors of our products, these three companies also distribute a broad range of healthcare products on behalf of many other companies. The loss of our relationship with one or more of these wholesalers, together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for our hospital, retail and other customers, could have a material\nadverse impact on our revenue and results of operations. A change in purchasing patterns or inventory levels, an increase in returns of our products, delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more of these wholesale drug distributors also could have a material adverse impact on our revenue, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur growth depends on our ability to timely and efficiently develop and successfully launch and market new pharmaceutical products ahead of our competitors.\nOur strategy for growth is dependent upon our ability to develop products that can be promoted through current marketing and distributions channels and, when appropriate, the enhancement of such marketing and distribution channels. We may fail to meet our anticipated time schedule for the filing of new applications or may decide not to pursue applications that we have already submitted or anticipate submitting. Our internal development of new pharmaceutical products is dependent upon the research and development capabilities of our personnel and our strategic business alliance infrastructure. We and our strategic business alliance partners might fail to develop new pharmaceutical products or acquired IPR&D or, if developed, we might fail to commercialize these new pharmaceutical products. In addition, we might not receive all necessary regulatory approvals or such approvals might involve delays, which may adversely affect the commercial success of our products. Our failure to develop new products or to receive regulatory approval of applications could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if successfully developed and launched, no assurance can be given as to the actual size of the market for any product or the level of profitability and sales of the product.\nOur inability to effectively manage or support our rapid growth may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nWe have grown rapidly as a result of several acquisitions, and additional growth through acquisitions is possible in the future. This growth has put significant demands on our processes, systems and people. Attracting, retaining and motivating key employees in various departments and locations to support our growth are critical to our business, and competition for these people can be significant. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees and if we do not effectively invest in systems and processes to manage and support our rapid growth and the challenges and difficulties associated with managing a larger, more complex business, and if we cannot effectively manage and integrate our increasingly diverse and global platform, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and the market value of our common stock could decline.\nWe have entered into several strategic business alliances that may not result in marketable products and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe have entered into several strategic business alliances that are designed to provide products that can be marketed through our distribution pipeline. These agreements might not result in additional FDA approved products, and we might not be able to market any such additional products at a profit. In addition, any clinical trial expenses that we may incur in connection with these strategic business alliances may negatively impact our financial results.\nWe may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions and we may face difficulties in integrating them, which could adversely affect our operating results, increase costs and place a significant strain on our management.\nIf we fail to manage the integration of our acquisitions and fail to achieve expected synergies and revenue growth, our business could be disrupted and our operating results could be negatively impacted. The operating success of our acquisitions involves the integration of products, processes and personnel into our business. In addition, the integration of acquisitions may require establishing or training a local management team and overseeing the operations remotely, and can involve cultural, monetary and systems challenges. Our personnel, systems, procedures, or controls may not be adequate to support both our ongoing business and the acquired businesses. If any newly-acquired businesses or assets require a disproportionate share of our resources and management\u2019s attention, our overall financial results may suffer.\nCharges to earnings resulting from acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) business acquisition accounting standards, we recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in acquired companies generally at their acquisition date fair values and, in each case, separately from goodwill. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred, which is also generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. After we complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flow:\n\u00b7 costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention, redeployment or relocation expenses;\n\u00b7 impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, including acquired IPR&D;\n\u00b7 amortization of intangible assets acquired;\n\u00b7 a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired;\n\u00b7 identification of or changes to assumed contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, contingent purchase price consideration, income tax contingencies and other non-income tax contingencies, after our final determination of the amounts for these contingencies or the conclusion of the measurement period (generally up to one year from the acquisition date), whichever comes first;\n\u00b7 charges to our operating results to eliminate certain duplicative pre-acquisition activities, to restructure our operations or to reduce our cost structure;\n\u00b7 charges to our operating results resulting from expenses incurred to effect the acquisition;\n\u00b7 changes to contingent consideration liabilities, including accretion and fair value adjustments. A significant portion of these adjustments could be accounted for as expenses that will decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those costs are incurred. Such charges could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flow, and could cause the market value of the common stock to decline.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had recorded $284.7 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet.\nOur revenues depend on sale of products manufactured by third parties, the loss or failure of any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nCertain of the pharmaceutical products that we market, representing a significant portion of our net revenues, are manufactured by third parties that serve as our only supplier of those products. Any delays or failure of a contract manufacturing partner to supply finished goods timely or in adequate volume could impede our marketing of those products. We expect this risk to become more significant as we receive approvals for new products to be manufactured through our strategic partnerships and as we seek additional growth opportunities beyond the capacity and capabilities of our current manufacturing facilities. If we are unable to obtain or retain third-party manufacturers for these products on commercially acceptable terms, we may not be able to distribute such products as planned. Any delays or difficulties with third-party manufacturers could adversely affect the marketing and distribution of certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to obtain regulatory certification of our manufacturing facility in India for production of pharmaceutical products for export to the United States, as well as other regulated world markets, could impair our ability to grow and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate a manufacturing campus in Paonta Sahib, India, which we acquired through a business combination in 2012. The manufacturing site is not currently approved by the FDA to manufacture products for export to the United States. It is our intention to obtain certification from the FDA and other regulatory authorities to allow this facility to manufacture\nproducts for export to the United States and other regulated world markets. An inability to obtain or maintain such certification could restrict our ability to achieve our growth objectives, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our employees and must continue to attract and retain key personnel in order to compete successfully, and any failure to do so could hinder successful execution of our business and development plans and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operation.\nOur performance depends, to a large extent, on the continued service of our key R&D personnel, other technical employees, managers and sales personnel and our ability to continue to attract and retain such personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, particularly for highly motivated and experienced R&D and other technical personnel. We are facing increasing competition from companies with greater financial resources for such personnel. As a result, we might not be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled personnel in the future, and the inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, and on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe become involved in legal proceedings from time to time, any of which may result in substantial losses, damage to our business and reputation and place a strain on our internal resources.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we become involved in legal proceedings with both private parties and certain government agencies, including the FDA. Any substantial litigation may result in verdicts against us, which may include significant monetary awards, judgments that certain of our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable and injunctions preventing the manufacture, marketing and sale of our products. If disputes are resolved unfavorably, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Any litigation, whether or not successful, may damage our reputation. Furthermore, we are likely to incur substantial expense in defending these lawsuits and the time demands of such lawsuits could divert management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns and interfere with our normal operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry.\nMany of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source, the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe require raw materials and components to manufacture and package pharmaceutical products. The principal components of our products are active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients and certain packaging materials. Many of these materials are available from only a single source and, in the case of many of our products, only one supplier of raw materials has been identified and qualified. Because FDA approval of drugs requires manufacturers to specify their proposed suppliers of active ingredients and certain packaging materials in their applications, FDA approval of any new supplier would be required if such active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the specified supplier. The qualification of a new supplier could delay our development and marketing efforts. If for any reason we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials or components required to produce and package our products, we may not be able to manufacture our products as planned.\nSales of our products may be adversely affected by the continuing consolidation of our customer base, which may have a material adverse effect on our business plans, financial position and results of operation.\nDrug wholesalers, drug retailers, and group purchasing organizations have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, significant consolidation. Such consolidation has provided and may continue to provide them with additional purchasing leverage, and consequently may increase the pricing pressures that we face. Our net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of retail chains, major distributors and other trade buyers, whether resulting from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors. In addition, since such a significant portion of our revenues is derived from relatively few customers, any financial difficulties experienced by a single customer, or any delay\nin receiving payments from a single customer, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur branded products may become subject to increased generic competition.\nTrends toward moving toward increased substitution and reimbursement of generics for cost-containment purposes may reduce and limit the sales of our off-patent branded products. Additionally, increased focus by the FDA on approval of generics may accelerate this trend.\nChanges in technology could render our products obsolete.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid technological change. The products that we sell today and their drug delivery methods may be replaced by more effective methods to deliver the same care, rendering our current products obsolete. Further, the technologies that we invest in for future use may not become the preferred method of delivery.\nRisks Related to Regulations.\nAny failure to comply with the complex reporting and payment obligations under Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs may result in litigation or sanctions.\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, false claims, marketing and pricing laws. We are also subject to Medicaid and other government reporting and payment obligations that are highly complex and at times ambiguous. Violations of these laws and reporting obligations are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The recent healthcare reform legislation made several changes to the federal anti-kickback statute, false claims laws, and healthcare fraud statute such as increasing penalties and making it easier for the government to bring sanctions against pharmaceutical companies. If our past, present or future operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or other similar governmental regulations, we may be subject to the applicable penalty associated with the violation, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and negatively impact our financial results. Further, if there is a change in laws, regulations or administrative or judicial interpretations, we may have to change our business practices or our existing business practices could be challenged as unlawful, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nChanges in healthcare law and policy changes may adversely affect our business plans and results of operations.\nThe sales of our products depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations including Pharmacy Benefit Managers (\u201cPBMs\u201d) and other healthcare-related organizations. We expect both federal and state governments in the U.S. and foreign governments to continue to propose and pass new legislation, rules and regulations designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Existing regulations that affect the price of pharmaceutical and other medical products may also change before any of our products are approved for marketing. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any product we develop in the future. In addition, PBMs and other third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products. Our products may not be considered cost effective, or adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize a return on our investments. All of these may harm our ability to market our products and generate profits.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulations which if they change and or we are not in compliance with, could increase our costs, subject us to various obligations and fines, or prevent us from selling our products or operating our facilities.\nNew, modified and additional regulations, statutes or legal interpretation, if any, could, among other things, require changes to manufacturing methods, expanded or different labeling, recall, replacement or discontinuation of certain products, additional recordkeeping procedures and expanded documentation of the properties of certain products and additional scientific substantiation. Such changes or new legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Certain of the regulatory risks that we are subject to are outlined below:\nWe must obtain approval from the FDA for each prescription pharmaceutical product that we market and the timing of such approval process is unknown and uncertain. The FDA approval process is typically lengthy, and approval is never certain. Our new products could take a significantly longer time than we expect to gain regulatory approval and may never gain approval. Even if the FDA or another regulatory agency approves a product, the approval may limit the indicated uses for a product, may otherwise limit our ability to promote, sell and distribute a product or may require post-marketing studies or impose other post-marketing obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on marketability and profitability of the new products.\nWe and our third-party manufacturers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA to assure regulatory compliance regarding the manufacturing, distribution, and promotion of pharmaceutical products. The FDA imposes stringent mandatory requirements on the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceutical products to ensure their safety and efficacy. The FDA also regulates drug labeling and the advertising of prescription drugs. A finding by a governmental agency or court that we are not in compliance with FDA requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to recalls and other enforcement actions by the FDA. The FDA or other government agencies having regulatory authority over pharmaceutical products may request us to voluntarily or involuntarily conduct product recalls due to disputed labeling claims, manufacturing issues, quality defects or for other reasons. Restriction or prohibition on sales, halting of manufacturing operations, recalls of our pharmaceutical products or other enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, such actions, in certain circumstances, may constitute an event of default under the terms of our various financing arrangements.\nIf the FDA changes its regulatory policies, it could force us to delay or suspend our manufacturing, distribution or sales of certain products. FDA interpretations of existing or pending regulations and standards may change over time with the advancement of associated technologies, industry trends, or prevailing scientific rationale. If the FDA changes its regulatory policies due to such factors, it could result in delay or suspension of the manufacturing, distribution or sales of certain of our products. In addition, modifications or enhancements of approved products are in many circumstances subject to additional FDA approvals which may or may not be granted and which may be subject to a lengthy application process. Any change in the FDA\u2019s enforcement policy or any decision by the FDA to require an approved application for one of our products not currently subject to the approved application requirements or any delay in the FDA approving an application for one of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive DEA regulation, which could result in our being fined or otherwise penalized if we are in non-compliance. The DEA could limit or reduce the amount of controlled substances which we are permitted to manufacture and market or issue fines and penalties against us for non-compliance with DEA regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the Federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act (\u201c DSCSA\u201d) that requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the salable unit level through the distribution system, which will become incrementally effective over a 10-year period. Beginning in November 2017, all prescription drug manufacturers, including us, must label prescription products with a unique serial number at the saleable unit level. Failure to meet this deadline would likely have a significant adverse impact on our business.\nThe FDA may require us to stop marketing certain unapproved drugs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operation.\nWe market several generic prescription products which do not have formal FDA approvals. These products are non-application drugs that are manufactured and marketed without FDA approved filings on the basis of their having been marketed by the pharmaceutical industry prior to the 1962 Amendments of the FDC Act. The FDA has increased its efforts to require companies to file and seek FDA approval for unapproved products, and when a product is approved, the FDA has typically increased its effort to remove other unapproved products from the market by issuing notices to companies currently manufacturing these products to cease its distribution of said products. If the FDA issues Warning Letters or notices with respect to one or more of our unapproved products, we may be forced to discontinue manufacture and marketing of the affected products, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. In 2013, we discontinued marketing of a previously unapproved product after receipt of a Warning Letter in October 2012.\nWe marketed six such unapproved products during 2015, generating net sales revenue of approximately $103.9 million. Of the six products marketed during 2015, none were approved through either an ANDA or an NDA prior to the filing of this Form 10-K.\nIn 2016, prior to the filing of this Form 10-K we have become aware that other entities have received approval for two products that the Company currently markets as unapproved products. At this time, we are unable to determine the specific effect that this may have on our financial statements or disclosures.\nThe FDA may authorize sales of some prescription pharmaceuticals on a non-prescription basis, which may reduce the profitability of our prescription products.\nThe FDA may change the designation of some prescription pharmaceuticals we currently sell to non-prescription. If we are unable to gain approval of our product on a non-prescription designation we may experience an adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company and its employees are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other benefits. In addition, the FCPA imposes recordkeeping standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of \u201coff books\u201d slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. If our employees, third-party sales representatives or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other remedial measures, including further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, as well as potential personnel changes and disciplinary actions.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property.\nThird parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent or delay us from manufacturing and selling some of our new products.\nThe manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical companies with patented brand products frequently sue companies that file applications to produce generic equivalents of their patented brand products for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, which may delay or prevent the entry of such generic products into the\nmarket. Generally, a generic drug may not be marketed until the applicable patent(s) on the brand name drug expire or are held to be not infringed, invalid, or unenforceable. When we or our development partners submit a filing to the FDA for approval of a generic drug, we or our development partners must certify either (i) that there is no patent listed by the FDA as covering the relevant brand product, (ii) that any patent listed as covering the brand product has expired, (iii) that the patent listed as covering the brand product will expire prior to the marketing of the generic product, in which case the filing will not be finally approved by the FDA until the expiration of such patent, or (iv) that any patent listed as covering the brand drug is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, sale or use of the generic product for which the filing is submitted.\nUnder any circumstance in which an act of infringement is alleged to occur, there is a risk that a brand pharmaceutical company may sue us for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Also, competing pharmaceutical companies may file lawsuits against us or our strategic partners alleging patent infringement or may file declaratory judgment actions of non-infringement, invalidity, or unenforceability against us relating to our own patents. We have been sued for patent infringement related to several of our filings and we anticipate that we may be sued once we file for other products in our pipeline. Such litigation is often costly and time-consuming and could result in a substantial delay in, or prevent the introduction and/or marketing of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if the parties settle their intellectual property disputes through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties, and the necessary licenses might not be available to us on terms we believe to be acceptable.\nOur patents and proprietary rights may be challenged, circumvented or otherwise compromised by competitors, which may result in our protected products losing their market exclusivity and becoming subject to generic competition before their patents expire.\nThe patent and proprietary rights position of competitors in the pharmaceutical industry generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and is the subject of much litigation. There can be no assurance that any patent applications or other proprietary rights, including licensed rights, relating to our potential products or processes will result in patents being issued or other proprietary rights secured, or that the resulting patents or proprietary rights, if any, will provide protection against competitors who: (i) successfully challenge our patents or proprietary rights; (ii) obtain patents or proprietary rights that may have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business; or (iii) are able to circumvent our patent or proprietary rights position. It is possible that other parties have conducted or are conducting research and could make discoveries of pharmaceutical formulations or processes that would precede any discoveries made by us, which could prevent us from obtaining patent or other protection for these discoveries or marketing products developed therefrom. Consequently, others could independently develop pharmaceutical products similar to or rendering obsolete those that we are planning to develop, or duplicate any of our products. Our inability to obtain patents for, or other proprietary rights in, our products and processes or the ability of competitors to circumvent or obsolete our patents or proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, our inability to successfully defend our existing patents against Paragraph IV challenges by competing drug companies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the patents that protect Azasite\u00ae were challenged by two generic competitors. We settled with one competitor and the courts found in our favor with the other. We expect that the Zioptan\u00ae patent will also be challenged.\nFurther, the majority of the drug products that we market are generics, with essentially no patent or proprietary rights attached. While this fact allowed us the opportunity to develop or to purchase and obtain FDA approval to market our generic products, it also allows competing drug companies to do the same. Should multiple additional drug companies choose to develop and market the same generic products that we actively market, our profit margins could decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Financing.\nOur indebtedness reduces our financial and operating flexibility.\nWe have entered into various credit arrangements to fund certain of our operations and activities, principally business combinations. During the prior year ended December 31, 2014 we significantly increased our debt obligations through new term loans. As of December 31, 2015, our debt includes an Existing Term Loan Facility with a remaining principal balance of $592.5 million, an Incremental Term Loan Facility with a remaining principal balance of $439.4 million, and $43.2 million principal balance in our Convertible Senior Notes due 2016 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) and we also have available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities (See Part II, Item 8 - Note 8 - \u201cFinancing Arrangements\u201d for definitions and descriptions of our Existing Term Loan Facility, Incremental Term Loan Facility and Notes and our credit facilities). A high level of indebtedness subjects us to a number of risks. In particular, a significant portion of our current indebtedness has variable interest terms meaning we are subject to the risks associated with higher interest rates, and moreover, a high level of indebtedness may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. In addition, our current debt arrangements require that we devote a significant portion of our cash flows to service amounts outstanding under those debt arrangements. We also are subject to various covenants with respect to our indebtedness, including the obligation to meet certain defined financial ratios and our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders is restricted. Further, our indebtedness may restrict or otherwise impair our ability to raise additional capital through other debt financing, which could restrict our ability to grow our business. Our ability to meet our debt obligations, to comply with all required covenants, and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance. General economic conditions and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. If we do not have sufficient funds on hand to pay our debt when due, we may be required to seek a waiver or amendment from our lenders, refinance our indebtedness, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets or sell additional shares of securities. We may not be able to complete such transactions on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our failure to generate sufficient funds to pay our debts or to undertake any of these actions successfully could result in a default on our debt obligations, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not generate cash flow sufficient to pay interest and make required principal repayments on our Term Loans.\nOn April 17, 2014, upon completing the Hi-Tech Acquisition, we entered into a $600.0 million term loan with certain other lenders with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. acting as the administrative agent (the \u201cExisting Term Loan\u201d) and on August 12, 2014, upon completing the VersaPharm Acquisition, we entered into a $445.0 million term loan with certain other lenders with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. acting as the administrative agent (the \u201cIncremental Term Loan\u201d). These term loans significantly increased our debt obligations. The Existing Term Loan and Incremental Term Loan each bear interest at a variable rate at a margin above prime or LIBOR, at our election. As a result of the restatements experienced in the year, the variable rate above prime or LIBOR was modified on November 13, 2015 to represent a variable amount dependent on the Company\u2019s credit rating as of the date at which the Company becomes current with SEC reporting requirements. The Company will be required to pay this increased interest rate until termination. In addition to our interest obligation, we are required to repay 0.25% of the principal balance quarterly, beginning with the second and first full quarter, respectively after entering into the loan agreements. The remaining outstanding balance under each of the Existing Term Loan and the Incremental Term Loan will be due and payable on April 17, 2021. If we do not generate sufficient operating cash flows to fund these payments or obtain additional funding from external sources at acceptable terms, we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy our principal and interest payment obligations when those obligations are due, which would place us into default under the terms of the Existing Term Loan and the Incremental Term Loan. Such default would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our borrowings are secured by all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets. If the Company defaults on its obligations under the Existing Term Loan or the Incremental Term Loans, the lenders may be able to foreclose upon its security interest and otherwise be entitled to obtain or control Company assets.\nWe may need to obtain additional capital to continue to grow our business.\nWe may require additional funds in order to materially grow our business. We require substantial liquidity to implement long-term cost savings and productivity improvement plans, continue capital spending to improve our manufacturing facilities\nto increase capacity and support product development programs, meet scheduled term debt and lease maturities, to effect acquisitions and to run our normal business operations. We may seek additional funds through public and private financing, including equity and debt offerings. However, adequate funds through the financial markets or from other sources may not be available to us when needed or on favorable terms. Without sufficient additional capital funding, we may be required to delay, scale back or abandon some or all of our product development, manufacturing, acquisition, licensing and marketing initiatives, or operations. Further, such additional financing, if obtained, may require the granting of rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the common stock and result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of the common stockholders and could include covenants and restrictions that limit our ability to operate or expand our business in a manner that we deem to be in our best interest.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock.\nExercise of options and granting of restricted stock units, may have a substantial dilutive effect on our common stock.\nIf the price per share of our common stock at the time of exercise of any stock options is in excess of the various exercise prices of such options, exercise of such options would have a dilutive effect on our common stock. As of December 31, 2015, holders of our outstanding options would receive 4.8 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $20.33 per share.\nWe may issue preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock may reduce the market value of our common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue up to a total of 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Subject to certain limitations, our Board of Directors may authorize issuance of shares of preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock without further action by holders of our common stock. If we issue shares of preferred stock, it could affect the rights or reduce the market value of our common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party. These terms may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. We continue to seek capital for the growth of our business, and this additional capital may be raised through the issuance of preferred stock.\nOther Risks.\nWe may be subject to significant disruptions or failures in our information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructures to operate our business. We also hold data in various data center facilities upon which our business depends. Although we have experienced occasional, actual or attempted breaches of our cybersecurity, none of these breaches has had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation. Any significant disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, system implementations or upgrades, computer viruses, third-party security breaches, employee error, theft, misuse or malfeasance could cause breaches of data security, loss of intellectual property and critical data and the release and misappropriation of sensitive competitive information. Any of these events could result in the loss of key information, impair our production and supply chain processes, damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter people from purchasing our products, cause us to incur significant costs to remedy any damages, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability and require us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses, and ultimately materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and value of our common stock.\nThe Chairman of our Board of Directors is subject to conflicts of interest, and through his stock ownership and position as Chairman has substantial influence over our business strategies and policies.\nJohn N. Kapoor, Ph.D., the Chairman of our Board of Directors and a principal shareholder, is the President of EJ Financial Enterprises, Inc. (\u201cEJ Financial\u201d), a healthcare consulting investment company. EJ Financial is involved in the management of healthcare companies in various fields, and Dr. Kapoor is involved in various capacities with the management and operation of these companies. The John N. Kapoor Trust dated September 20, 1989 (the \u201cKapoor Trust\u201d), the beneficiary and sole trustee of which is Dr. Kapoor, is a principal shareholder of each of these companies. As a result, Dr. Kapoor does not devote his full time to our business. Although such companies do not currently compete directly with us, certain companies with which EJ Financial is involved are in the pharmaceutical business. Discoveries made by one or more of these companies could render our products less competitive or obsolete. Potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Dr. Kapoor beneficially controls more than 25% of our common stock. Decisions made by Dr. Kapoor with respect to his and his related parties\u2019 ownership or trading of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and an adverse effect on our business.\nWe could experience business interruptions at our manufacturing facilities, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe manufacture drug products at two international and three domestic manufacturing facilities. Any one or more of these facilities may be forced to shut down or may be unable to operate at full capacity as a result of hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, storms and other extreme weather events as well as strikes, war, violent upheavals, terrorist acts and other force majeure events. For example, our manufacturing facility in Somerset, New Jersey was shut down for approximately two weeks in October and November 2012 as a result of power outages and related business disruptions caused by Superstorm Sandy. A significant disruption at any of these facilities, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship drug products to the market on a timely basis, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 10180, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "AKRXQ"}
