Before you invest you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this Annual Report. Any of the risks and uncertainties set forth herein could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the trading price or value of our securities. Additional risks not currently known to us or which we consider immaterial based on information currently available to us may also materially adversely affect us. As a result, you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Development of Ocuphire\u2019s Product Candidates\nOcuphire currently depends entirely on the success of Nyxol and APX3330, its only product candidates. Ocuphire may never receive marketing approval for, or successfully commercialize, Nyxol, APX3330, or other product candidates it may pursue in the future for any indication.\nOcuphire currently has only two product candidates, Nyxol and APX3330, in clinical development, and its business depends on their successful clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of a drug product are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, where regulations may differ. Ocuphire is not permitted to market its product candidates in the United States until it receives approval of an NDA from the FDA or in any foreign countries until it receives the requisite approval from such countries. Ocuphire has not submitted an NDA to the FDA or comparable applications to other regulatory authorities or received marketing approval for its product candidates. Before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial sale of its product candidates for a particular indication, Ocuphire must demonstrate through preclinical testing and clinical trials that the applicable product candidate is safe and effective for use in that target indication. This process can take many years and may be followed by post-marketing studies and surveillance together which will require the expenditure of substantial resources beyond the proceeds raised in Ocuphire\u2019s equity and debt financings to date. Of the large number of drugs in development in the United States, only a small percentage of drugs successfully complete the FDA regulatory approval process and are commercialized. Accordingly, even if Ocuphire is able to complete development of its product candidates, Ocuphire cannot assure you that its product candidates will be approved or commercialized.\nObtaining approval of an NDA is an extensive, lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and the FDA may delay, limit or deny approval of Ocuphire\u2019s product candidates for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nthe data collected from preclinical studies and clinical trials of Ocuphire\u2019s product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA;\n\u2022\nOcuphire may not be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that its product candidates are safe and effective for any indication;\n\u2022\nthe results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance or clinical significance required by the FDA for approval;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may disagree with the number, design, size, conduct, or implementation of Ocuphire\u2019s clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may not find the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials sufficient to demonstrate that Ocuphire\u2019s product candidates\u2019 clinical and other benefits outweigh the safety risks;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may disagree with Ocuphire\u2019s interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may not accept data generated at Ocuphire\u2019s clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may have difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting in a timely manner or the advisory committee may recommend against approval of Ocuphire\u2019s application or may recommend that the FDA require, as a condition of approval, additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, limitations on approved labeling or distribution and use restrictions;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may require development of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) as a condition of approval;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may identify deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which Ocuphire enters into agreements for clinical and commercial supplies; or\n\u2022\nthe FDA may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nThe results of previous clinical trials may not be predictive of future results, and the results of Ocuphire\u2019s current and planned clinical trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities.\nThe results from the prior preclinical studies and clinical trials for Nyxol and APX3330 discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report may not necessarily be predictive of the results of future preclinical studies or clinical trials. Even if Ocuphire is able to complete its planned clinical trials of its product candidates according to its current development timeline, the results from its prior clinical trials of its product candidates may not be replicated in these future trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries (including those with greater resources and experience than Ocuphire) have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in early-stage development, and Ocuphire cannot be certain that it will not face similar setbacks. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, preclinical findings made while clinical trials were underway or safety or efficacy observations made in clinical trials, including previously unreported adverse events (\u201cAEs\u201d). Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials nonetheless have failed to obtain FDA approval. If Ocuphire fails to produce positive results in its clinical trials of any of its product candidates, the development timelines, regulatory approvals, and commercialization prospects for its product candidates, as well as Ocuphire\u2019s business and financial prospects, would be adversely affected. Further, Ocuphire\u2019s product candidates may not be approved even if they achieve their respective primary endpoints in additional Phase 3 registration trials. The FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities may disagree with Ocuphire\u2019s trial designs or its interpretation of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials. In addition, any of these regulatory authorities may change requirements for the approval of a product candidate even after reviewing and providing comments or advice on a protocol for a pivotal clinical trial that has the potential to result in approval by the FDA or another regulatory authority. Furthermore, any of these regulatory authorities may also approve Ocuphire\u2019s product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than it requests or may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials.\nIf Ocuphire\u2019s future clinical and preclinical trials (as described elsewhere in this Annual Report) are successful, Ocuphire plans to eventually seek regulatory approvals of Nyxol and APX3330 initially in the United States, Canada, and Europe, and may seek approvals in other geographies. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate for any target indication, Ocuphire must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical studies, and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the FDA, that the product candidate is safe and effective for use for that target indication. Ocuphire cannot assure you that the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities would consider its planned clinical trials to be sufficient to serve as the basis for approval of its product candidates for any indication. The FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities retain broad discretion in evaluating the results of Ocuphire\u2019s clinical trials and in determining whether the results demonstrate that its product candidates are safe and effective. If Ocuphire is required to conduct clinical trials of its product candidates in addition to those it has planned prior to approval, Ocuphire will need substantial additional funds, and cannot assure you that the results of any such outcomes trial or other clinical trials will be sufficient for approval.\nAdditional data and/or time may be required to obtain U.S. regulatory approval for any of Ocuphire\u2019s product candidates that are deemed to be a drug/device combination product candidate.\nOcuphire\u2019s eye drop product candidates are now considered combination products with both drug and device components. The FDA requires both the drug and device components of combination product candidates to be reviewed as part of an NDA submission. Given this is a recent development with very few examples, the FDA\u2019s application of the regulations is evolving for drug/device combination products including single-use and mutli-dose eye droppers. Ocuphire may experience request for additional data and/or delays in the development and commercialization of its drug led combination product candidates, due to regulatory uncertainties in the product development and approval process.\nIf clinical trials of Ocuphire\u2019s product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce positive results, Ocuphire may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of such product candidates.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of Nyxol, Ocuphire must complete registration Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy in humans. In addition, for Nyxol chronic indications, Ocuphire must complete a six-month toxicology study in rabbits, which has completed the in-life portion. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete, and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of development. In addition, based on the Phase 2 safety, tolerability and efficacy results for APX3330, Ocuphire would need to conduct further animal toxicology studies and additional Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of APX3330.\nOcuphire may continue to experience delays in manufacturing and its clinical trials, and Ocuphire, or its future collaborators, may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could result in increased development costs and delay, and could limit or prevent its ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize its product candidates, including:\n\u2022\nregulators or IRBs may not authorize Ocuphire or its investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site including due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or other public health emergency;\n\u2022\ngovernment or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines may require Ocuphire to perform additional clinical trials or use substantial additional resources to obtain regulatory approval, including due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or other public health emergency;\n\u2022\nOcuphire may have delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites, including due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or other public health emergency;\n\u2022\nclinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and Ocuphire may decide, or regulators may require it, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs, including due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or other public health emergency;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials may be larger, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than Ocuphire anticipates, including due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or other public health emergency;\n\u2022\nOcuphire\u2019s third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to Ocuphire in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nOcuphire\u2019s patients or medical investigators may be unwilling to follow its clinical trial protocols;\n\u2022\nOcuphire might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials may be greater than Ocuphire anticipates, including due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or other public health emergency;\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of any product candidate or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials may be insufficient or inadequate;\n\u2022\nthe product candidate may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing Ocuphire or its investigators, regulators or IRBs to suspend or terminate the trials;\n\u2022\nclinical trials may be delayed or terminated because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or another public health emergency; and\n\u2022\nfederal agencies may, due to reduced manpower or diverted resources to the COVID-19 pandemic, require more time to review clinical trial protocols and INDs.\nIf Ocuphire experiences delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, Ocuphire\u2019s ability to conduct and complete those clinical trials, and its ability to seek and receive necessary regulatory approvals, could be delayed or prevented.\nOcuphire or its future collaborators may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for its product candidates if Ocuphire is unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or analogous regulatory authorities outside the United States. Patient enrollment can be affected by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nseverity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\navailability and efficacy of medications already approved for the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\neligibility criteria for the trial in question;\n\u2022\ncompetition for eligible patients with other companies conducting clinical trials for product candidates seeking to treat the same indication or patient population;\n\u2022\nits payments for conducting clinical trials;\n\u2022\nperceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u2022\nefforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022\npatient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment;\n\u2022\nproximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n\u2022\nthe ability of patients to safely participate in clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health emergencies; and\n\u2022\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately during periods in which social distancing is required or recommended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe recent COVID-19 pandemic may also increase the time required to recruit patients for a study, and may also diminish the ability to monitor patients during the clinical trial. Ocuphire\u2019s inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for its clinical trials or retain sufficient enrollment through the completion of its trials would result in significant delays or may require Ocuphire to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in Ocuphire\u2019s clinical trials may result in increased development costs for its product candidates and cause its stock price to decline.\nOcuphire or others could discover that Ocuphire\u2019s product candidates lack sufficient efficacy, or that they cause undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval or commercialization.\nBecause both Nyxol and APX3330 have been tested in relatively small patient populations, at a limited range of daily doses up to 0.75% Phentolamine Ophthalmic Solution (which is the same as 1.0% Phentolamine Mesylate Ophthalmic Solution) and up to 720 mg respectively, and for limited durations to date, it is possible that Ocuphire\u2019s clinical trials have or will indicate an apparent positive effect of Nyxol or APX3330 that is greater than the actual positive effect, if any, or that additional and unforeseen side effects may be observed as its development progresses. The discovery that either Nyxol (alone or in combination with LDP) or APX3330 lacks sufficient efficacy, or that they cause undesirable side effects (including side effects not previously identified in Ocuphire\u2019s completed clinical trials), could cause Ocuphire or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, or discontinue clinical trials, and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications.\nThe discovery that Ocuphire\u2019s product candidates lack sufficient efficacy or that they cause undesirable side effects that were not previously identified could prevent Ocuphire from commercializing such product candidates and generating revenues from sales. In addition, if Ocuphire receives marketing approval for its product candidates and Ocuphire or others later discover that it is less effective, or identify undesirable side effects caused by its product candidates:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product;\n\u2022\nOcuphire may be required to recall the product, change the way this product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials, or change the labeling or distribution of the product (including REMS);\n\u2022\nadditional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of, or the manufacturing processes for, the product;\n\u2022\nOcuphire may be subject to fines, injunctions, or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nOcuphire could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u2022\nthe product may be rendered less competitive and sales may decrease; or\n\u2022\nOcuphire\u2019s reputation may suffer generally both among clinicians and patients.\nAny one or a combination of these events could prevent Ocuphire from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing the product candidate, which in turn could delay or prevent Ocuphire from generating significant, or any, revenues from the sale of the product candidate.\nChanges in regulatory requirements or FDA guidance, or unanticipated events during Ocuphire\u2019s clinical trials, may result in changes to clinical trial protocols or additional clinical trial requirements, which could result in increased costs to Ocuphire or delays in its development timeline.\nChanges in regulatory requirements or FDA guidance, or unanticipated events during Ocuphire\u2019s clinical trials, may require Ocuphire to amend clinical trial protocols or the FDA may impose additional clinical trial requirements. Amendments to Ocuphire\u2019s clinical trial protocols would require resubmission to the FDA and IRBs for review and approval, and may adversely impact the cost, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. If Ocuphire experiences delays completing, or if it terminates, any Phase 2 or Phase 3 trials, or if it is required to conduct additional clinical trials, the commercial prospects for its product candidates may be harmed and its ability to generate product revenues will be delayed.\nIf Ocuphire fails to receive regulatory approval for any of its planned indications for its product candidates or fails to develop additional product candidates, Ocuphire\u2019s commercial opportunity will be limited.\nOcuphire is initially focused on the development of its product candidates for its target indications, the reversal of pharmacologically-induced mydriasis, treatment of presbyopia, NVD, DR and DME. However, Ocuphire cannot assure you that it will be able to obtain regulatory approval of its product candidates for any indication, or successfully commercialize its product candidates, if approved. If Ocuphire does not receive regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, its product candidates for one or more of its targeted or other indications, Ocuphire\u2019s commercial opportunity will be limited.\nOcuphire may pursue clinical development of additional acquired or in-licensing product candidates. Developing, obtaining regulatory approval for and commercializing additional product candidates will require substantial additional funding beyond the net proceeds of Ocuphire\u2019s completed equity and debt financings, and are prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug product development. Ocuphire cannot assure you that it will be able to successfully advance any additional product candidates through the development process.\nEven if it obtains FDA approval to market additional product candidates, Ocuphire cannot assure you that any such product candidates will be successfully commercialized, widely accepted in the marketplace, or more effective than other commercially available alternatives. If Ocuphire is unable to successfully develop and commercialize additional product candidates, its commercial opportunity will be limited.\nOcuphire has limited drug research and discovery capabilities and may need to acquire or license product candidates from third parties to expand its product candidate pipeline.\nOcuphire currently has limited drug research and discovery capabilities. Accordingly, if it is to expand its product candidate pipeline beyond Nyxol and APX3330 and its pipeline candidates, Ocuphire may need to acquire or license product candidates from third parties. Ocuphire would face significant competition in seeking to acquire or license promising product candidates. Many of its competitors for such promising product candidates may have significantly greater financial resources and more extensive experience in preclinical testing and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products, and thus, may be a more attractive option to a potential licensor than Ocuphire. If Ocuphire is unable to acquire or license additional promising product candidates, it may not be able to expand its product candidate pipeline.\nIf Ocuphire is able to acquire or license other product candidates, such license agreements will likely impose various obligations upon it, and its licensors may have the right to terminate the license thereunder in the event of a material breach or, in some cases, at will. A termination of a future license could result in Ocuphire\u2019s loss of the right to use the licensed intellectual property, which could adversely affect Ocuphire\u2019s ability to develop and commercialize a future product candidate, if approved, as well as harm its competitive business position and its business prospects.\nOcuphire may expend its limited resources to pursue a particular indication and fail to capitalize on indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause Ocuphire has limited financial and managerial resources, it is currently focusing only on development programs that it identifies for specific indications for its product candidates. As a result, Ocuphire may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities for other indications, or with other potential product candidates that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Ocuphire\u2019s resource allocation decisions may cause it to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Ocuphire\u2019s spending on current and future research and development programs for specific indications or future product candidates may not yield any commercially viable product. If Ocuphire does not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for its product candidates, it may not gain approval or achieve market acceptance of that candidate, and its business and financial results will be harmed.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations.\nNew tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, the Tax Act, as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) enacted in March 2020, enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws. Future guidance from the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to the Tax Act may affect us, and certain aspects of the Tax Act could be repealed or modified in future legislation. For example, the CARES Act, modified certain provisions of the Tax Act and proposals have recently been made in Congress (which have not yet been enacted) to make tax law changes that could have a material adverse impact on us.\nRisks Related to Ocuphire\u2019s Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nOcuphire has incurred only losses since inception. Ocuphire expects to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nSince inception, Ocuphire incurred only operating losses. Ocuphire\u2019s net losses were $56.7 million and $24.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, Ocuphire had an accumulated deficit of $89.4 million. Ocuphire has funded its operations primarily through issuance of promissory notes and convertible notes in private placements, and then common stock and warrants after becoming a publicly-traded company. It has devoted substantially all of its financial resources and efforts to the clinical development of its product candidates. Even assuming Ocuphire obtains regulatory approval for one or more of its product candidates, Ocuphire expects that it will be at least eighteen months before it has a product candidate ready for commercialization. Ocuphire expects to continue to incur significant expenses and increased operating losses for the foreseeable future.\nTo become and remain profitable, Ocuphire must develop and eventually commercialize a product with market potential. This will require Ocuphire to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval for a product candidate, manufacturing, marketing, and selling any drug for which it may obtain regulatory approval and satisfying any post-marketing requirements. Ocuphire is the early stages of most of these activities. Ocuphire may never succeed in these activities and, even if it does, it may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability.\nIf Ocuphire does achieve profitability, it may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on an annual basis. Its failure to become or remain profitable may decrease Ocuphire\u2019s value and could impair its ability to raise capital, maintain its research and development efforts, expand its business, or continue its operations.\nOcuphire has not generated any revenue from sales of any products and may never be profitable.\nOcuphire has no products approved for commercial sale, and does not anticipate generating any product revenue, unless and until either Nyxol, APX3330 or another product candidate receives the regulatory approvals necessary for commercialization in one or more jurisdictions. Ocuphire\u2019s ability to generate revenue depends on a number of factors, including its ability to:\n\u2022\nobtain favorable results from and complete the clinical development of both Nyxol and APX3330 for their planned indications, including successful completion of additional clinical trials for these indications;\n\u2022\nsubmit applications to regulatory authorities for both product candidates and receive timely marketing approvals in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022\nestablish and maintain commercially viable supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that can provide adequate, in both amount and quality, products and services to support clinical development and meet the market demand for product candidates that we develop, if approved;\n\u2022\nestablish sales and marketing capabilities to effectively market and sell its product candidates in the United States or other markets, either alone or with a pharmaceutical partner;\n\u2022\naddress any competing products and technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nobtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for customers and patients from government and third-party payors for product candidates that we develop; and\n\u2022\nachieve market acceptance of its product candidates.\nEven if Ocuphire\u2019s product candidates are approved for commercial sale in one or all of the initial indications that it is pursuing, they may not gain market acceptance or achieve commercial success. In addition, Ocuphire anticipates incurring significant costs associated with commercializing its product candidates. Ocuphire may not achieve profitability soon after generating product revenue, if ever, and may be unable to continue operations without continued funding.\nOcuphire\u2019s recurring operating losses have raised substantial doubt regarding its ability to continue as a going concern.\nOcuphire\u2019s recurring operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, its independent registered public accounting firm has issued its report on Ocuphire\u2019s financial statements and has expressed substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Ocuphire has no current source of revenue to sustain its present activities, and it does not expect to generate revenue until and unless the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities approves, and it successfully commercializes, its product candidates. Accordingly, Ocuphire\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern will require it to obtain additional financing to fund its operations. Uncertainty surrounding Ocuphire\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern may make it more difficult for it to obtain financing for the continuation of its operations and could result in a loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, contractors, and employees.\nOcuphire\u2019s relatively short operating history may make it difficult for investors to evaluate the success of its business to date and to assess its future viability.\nOcuphire is a clinical-stage company, and its operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing its company, business planning, raising capital, and developing its product candidates. Ocuphire has not yet demonstrated its ability to successfully complete a Phase 3 program, obtain regulatory approval, manufacture a product at commercial scale, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization.\nAdditionally, there is no operating history on which investors may evaluate this business and its prospects. Investment in a start-up company such as Ocuphire is inherently subject to many risks. These risks and difficulties include challenges in accurate financial planning as a result of: (a) accumulated losses; (b) uncertainties resulting from a relatively limited time period in which to develop and evaluate business strategies as compared to companies with longer operating histories; (c) compliance with regulations required to commence sales on future products; (d) reliance on third parties for clinical, manufacturing, analytical laboratory work, preclinical, regulatory, commercialization or other activities; (e) financing the business; and (f) meeting the challenges of the other risk factors described herein. Ocuphire has no operating history upon which investors may base an evaluation of its performance; therefore, it is subject to all risks incident to the creation and development of a new business. There can be no assurance that Ocuphire can realize its plans on its projected timetable in order to reach sustainable or profitable operations.\nOcuphire will need substantial additional capital in the future. If additional capital is not available, it will have to delay, reduce or cease operations.\nOcuphire will need to raise additional capital to continue to fund the further development of its product candidates and operations. Its future capital requirements may be substantial and will depend on many factors including:\n\u2022\nthe scope, size, rate of progress, results, and costs of researching and developing its product candidates, and initiating and completing its preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe cost, timing and outcome of its efforts to obtain marketing approval for its product candidates in the United States and other countries, including to fund the preparation and filing of NDAs with the FDA for its product candidates and to satisfy related FDA requirements and regulatory requirements in other countries;\n\u2022\nthe number and characteristics of any additional product candidates it develops or acquires, if any;\n\u2022\nOcuphire\u2019s ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nthe amount of revenue, if any, from commercial sales, should its product candidates receive marketing approval;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with commercializing its product candidates, if Ocuphire receives marketing approval, including the cost and timing of developing sales and marketing capabilities or entering into strategic collaborations to market and sell its product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe cost of manufacturing its product candidates or products Ocuphire successfully commercializes; and\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with general corporate activities, such as the cost of filing, prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and making regulatory filings.\nChanging circumstances may cause Ocuphire to consume capital significantly faster than it currently anticipates. Because the outcome of any clinical trial is highly uncertain, Ocuphire cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of its product candidates. Additional financing may not be available when Ocuphire needs it, or may not be available on terms that are favorable to Ocuphire. In addition, Ocuphire may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if Ocuphire believes it has sufficient funds for its current or future operating plans. If adequate funds are unavailable to it on a timely basis, or at all, Ocuphire may not be able to continue the development of its product candidates, or commercialize its product candidates, if approved, unless it finds a strategic partner.\nWorldwide economic and social instability could adversely affect Ocuphire\u2019s revenue, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe health of the global economy, and the equity and credit markets in particular, as well as the stability of the social fabric of our society, affects our business and operating results. For example, the equity and credit markets may be adversely affected by the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine and measures taken in response thereto. If the equity and credit markets are not favorable, we may be unable to raise additional financing when needed or on favorable terms. Our vendors and development partners may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations, which may adversely impact their ability to purchase our products or to pay for our products on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, adverse economic conditions, such as recent supply chain disruptions and labor shortages and persistent inflation, have affected, and may continue to adversely affect our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide our manufacturers with materials and components, which may negatively impact our business. These economic conditions make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to Ocuphire\u2019s stockholders, restrict Ocuphire\u2019s operations, or require Ocuphire to relinquish rights to its technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as Ocuphire can generate substantial product revenues, it expects to finance its cash needs through a combination of equity and debt financings as well as potential strategic collaborations and licensing arrangements. It does not have any committed external source of funds. Debt financing or preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting Ocuphire\u2019s ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf Ocuphire raises funds through strategic collaborations or marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements with third parties, it may have to relinquish valuable rights to its technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to it. If it is unable to raise additional funds when needed, Ocuphire may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate its product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that it would otherwise prefer to develop and market itself. This may reduce the value of its common stock.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nThe FDA requires the completion of a toxicology study of similar duration before trials longer than six months can be conducted such as Phase 3 safety exposure trials for chronic indications or efficacy trials with such six-month endpoints. This may lead to a significant delay in the commencement of long-term clinical trials by Ocuphire or the failure of its product candidates to obtain marketing approval.\nAt this time, Ocuphire can run trials using Nyxol up to 28 days in duration based on its completed 28-day rabbit toxicology study. Therefore, the planned Phase 3 registration efficacy trials for presbyopia and NVD, with dosing for 7 to 14 days, may be conducted without further toxicology studies. Until Ocuphire has completed a six-month toxicology study for Nyxol, FDA regulations restrict it from conducting clinical trials longer than 6 months in duration targeting chronic indications, which at this time is a planned 1-year Phase 3 safety exposure trial to support chronic indications of presbyopia and NVD. Ocuphire completed the in-life portion of the six-month toxicology study in rabbits for Nyxol in the fourth quarter of 2021, with an expected completion and draft report in mid-2022. For APX3330, the drug has already been dosed for more than a year in humans and completed over 15 single- and repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats and dogs (including 2 studies up to 3 months in duration); with this data Ocuphire initiated its 24-week clinical trial for APX3330 without the need for further toxicology studies requested by the FDA. Ocuphire expects to complete further toxicology studies for future clinical trials prior to any marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of APX3330. Clinical trials may be delayed due to these clinical restrictions and additional oversight by the FDA. In addition, the findings in the toxicology studies could affect the outcome of NDA reviews, and, if approved, labels and uses of Ocuphire\u2019s product candidates.\nEven if it receives marketing approval for its product candidates in the United States, Ocuphire may never receive regulatory approval to market such product candidates outside of the United States.\nIn addition to the United States, Ocuphire intends to seek regulatory approval to market its product candidates in Europe, Japan, Canada, and Australia, and potentially other markets. If Ocuphire pursues additional product candidates in the future, it may seek regulatory approval of such product candidates outside the United States. In order to market any product outside of the United States, however, Ocuphire must establish and comply with the numerous and varying safety, efficacy and other regulatory requirements of these other countries. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product candidate testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approvals in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The marketing approval processes in other countries may include all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA approval in the United States as well as other risks. In particular, in many countries outside of the United States, products must receive pricing and reimbursement approval before the product can be commercialized. Obtaining this approval can result in substantial delays in bringing products to market in such countries. Marketing approval in one country does not ensure marketing approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining marketing approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. Failure to obtain marketing approval in other countries or any delay or other setback in obtaining such approval would impair Ocuphire\u2019s ability to market its product candidates in such foreign markets. Any such impairment would reduce the size of Ocuphire\u2019s potential market, which could have an adverse impact on its business, results of operations and prospects.\nEven if Ocuphire obtains marketing approval for its product candidates, such product candidates could be subject to post-marketing, obligations, restrictions or withdrawal from the market, and Ocuphire may be subject to substantial penalties if it fails to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with a product following approval.\nAny product candidate for which Ocuphire, or its future collaborators, obtains marketing approval in the future, as well as the manufacturing processes, post-approval studies and measures, labeling, advertising, and promotional activities for such drug, among other things, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including the requirement to implement a REMS, which could include requirements for a restricted distribution system.\nThe FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product candidate. The FDA and other agencies, including the Department of Justice, closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure that they are manufactured, marketed, and distributed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if Ocuphire, or any future collaborator, does not market a product candidate for which it receives marketing approval for only its approved indications, Ocuphire, or the collaborator, may be subject to warnings or enforcement action for off-label promotion. Violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDC Act\u201d) and other statutes, including the False Claims Act, relating to the promotion and advertising of prescription drugs, may lead to investigations or allegations of violations of federal or state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and state consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown AEs or other problems with Ocuphire\u2019s product candidates or its manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:\n\u2022\nlitigation involving patients taking Ocuphire\u2019s drugs;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on such drugs, manufacturers, or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the labeling or marketing of a drug;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on drug distribution or use;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwarning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of the drugs from the market;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that Ocuphire submits;\n\u2022\nproduct recall or public notification or medical product safety alerts to healthcare professionals;\n\u2022\nfines, restitution, or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022\ndamage to relationships with any potential collaborators;\n\u2022\nunfavorable press coverage and damage to Ocuphire\u2019s reputation;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of drugs;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure; or\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nOcuphire may seek to avail itself of mechanisms to expedite the development or approval for product candidates it may pursue in the future, such as fast track or breakthrough designation, but such mechanisms may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nOcuphire may seek fast track designation, breakthrough designation, orphan drug designation, priority review, or accelerated approval for product candidates it may pursue in the future. For example, if a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the drug sponsor may apply for FDA fast track designation. However, the FDA has broad discretion with regard to these mechanisms, and even if Ocuphire believes a particular product candidate is eligible for any such mechanism, it cannot guarantee that the FDA would decide to grant it. Even if it does obtain fast track or priority review designation or pursue an accelerated approval pathway, Ocuphire may not experience a faster development process, review, or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw a particular designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from Ocuphire\u2019s clinical development program.\nA breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Designation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if Ocuphire believes a product candidate meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. Ocuphire cannot be sure that its evaluation of a product candidate as qualifying for breakthrough therapy designation will meet the FDA\u2019s requirements. In any event, the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review, or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more product candidates qualifies as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or may decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for Ocuphire and its future collaborators to obtain marketing approval of its product candidates and affect their pricing.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of a product candidate, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect Ocuphire\u2019s ability, or the ability of its future collaborators, to profitably sell any drug for which it, or they, obtains marketing approval. Ocuphire expects that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and cause downward pressure on the price that Ocuphire, or its future collaborators, may charge for any approved drug.\nFor example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d), and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Healthcare Reform Act, which expanded health care coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual mandate for health insurance coverage and which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs.\nThere have also been efforts by federal and state government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices.\nGeneral legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for Ocuphire\u2019s product candidates. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare (but not Medicaid) payments to providers in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on Ocuphire could have an adverse impact on results of operations.\nAdoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, Ocuphire\u2019s current or future products if approved for sale. Ocuphire cannot, however, predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the Healthcare Reform Act or other federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect Ocuphire\u2019s future business and financial results.\nThere have been judicial and congressional challenges and amendments to certain aspects of the ACA, and Ocuphire expects there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future, as well as efforts to repeal and replace it. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These new laws have resulted in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise may affect the prices Ocuphire may obtain for any product candidate for which marketing approval is obtained. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Moreover, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent Ocuphire from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize its drugs. Further, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. In addition, Congress is considering additional health reform measures, such as capping the costs for prescription drugs covered by Medicare Part D and by setting the annual out-of-pocket limit at $2,000 beginning in 2024, as part of other health reform initiatives.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. Ocuphire cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance, or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of a product candidate, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval or subject Ocuphire or its future collaborators to more stringent drug labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nGovernments outside of the United States tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect Ocuphire\u2019s revenues from the sales of a drug, if any.\nIn some countries, particularly in the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a drug. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, Ocuphire, or its future collaborators, may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of its products to other available therapies. If reimbursement of Ocuphire\u2019s drugs is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, its business could be harmed.\nOcuphire\u2019s relationships with healthcare providers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose Ocuphire to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, and diminished profits and future earnings, among other penalties and consequences.\nHealthcare providers and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidate for which Ocuphire obtains marketing approval. Ocuphire\u2019s current and future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose Ocuphire to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which it markets, sells, and distributes product candidates for which it obtains marketing approval. Restrictions and obligations under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nthe federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, impose criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022\nHIPAA imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain people and entities with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act under the Affordable Care Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report specially to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to physician payments and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests; and\n\u2022\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. Certain state and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in ways that differ from each other and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that Ocuphire\u2019s current and future business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that Ocuphire\u2019s business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If Ocuphire\u2019s operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to it, it may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of its operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom Ocuphire expects to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil, and administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming, and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if Ocuphire is successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against it, its business may be impaired.\nOcuphire is subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Compliance with these legal standards could impair its ability to compete in domestic and international markets. Ocuphire could face criminal liability and other serious consequences for violations which could harm its business.\nOcuphire is subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which Ocuphire conducts activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors, and other partners from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. Ocuphire may engage third parties for clinical trials outside of the United States, to sell its products abroad once it enters a commercialization phase, and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals. Ocuphire has direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. Ocuphire can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of its employees, agents, contractors, and other partners, even if it does not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences.\nOcuphire employees or representatives may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including violating applicable regulatory standards and requirements or engaging in insider trading, which could significantly harm Ocuphire\u2019s business.\nOcuphire is exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to:\n\u2022\ncomply with the regulations of the FDA and applicable non-U.S. regulators;\n\u2022\nprovide accurate information to the FDA and applicable non-U.S. regulators;\n\u2022\ncomply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad;\n\u2022\nreport financial information or data accurately; or\n\u2022\ndisclose unauthorized activities to Ocuphire.\nIn particular, sales, marketing, and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing, and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs, and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of, including trading on, information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to Ocuphire\u2019s reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions Ocuphire takes to detect and prevent this activity may be ineffective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting it from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against Ocuphire, and Ocuphire is not successful in defending itself or asserting its rights, those actions could have a significant impact on its business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of its operations.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. If found to have improperly promoted off-label uses, Ocuphire may become subject to significant liability.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA or such other regulatory agencies as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. If Ocuphire receives marketing approval for its product candidates for a certain indication, physicians may nevertheless prescribe such products to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If Ocuphire is found to have promoted such off-label uses, it may become subject to significant liability. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. If Ocuphire cannot successfully manage the promotion of its product candidates, if approved, it could become subject to significant liability, which would adversely affect its business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Ocuphire\u2019s Product Candidates\nOcuphire faces substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing, or commercializing products before or more successfully than it does.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. Ocuphire expects to face competition with respect to its product candidates, if approved, and will face competition with respect to any future product candidates that it may seek to develop or commercialize from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions, and government agencies worldwide. The ophthalmic therapies market is highly competitive and dynamic. Ocuphire\u2019s success will depend, in part, on its ability to obtain a share of the market for its planned indications.\nNyxol\nOcuphire is developing Nyxol for use in three different indications: the reversal of pharmacologically induced mydriasis (\u201cRM\u201d), the treatment of presbyopia and the treatment of NVD. In addition to currently approved therapies, any product that is developed for any of the three indications could compete with Nyxol. Such a product could reduce the overall market opportunity for Nyxol. Other pharmaceutical companies may develop therapies for the same indications that would compete with Nyxol, if approved, and that would not infringe the claims of Ocuphire\u2019s patents, pending patent applications, or other proprietary rights, which could adversely affect its business and results of operations.\nRM\nCurrently, there are no available and approved pharmacological therapies for NVD or RM and Ocuphire is not aware of any in development. Rev-Eyes\u00ae (dapiprazole), an alpha-1 antagonist, was approved by the FDA in 1990 to reverse mydriasis induced by adrenergic or anticholinergic agents. Rev-Eyes was withdrawn in the past from the market for reasons unrelated to safety or efficacy, according to the FDA.\nPresbyopia\nThe FDA approved VuityTM eye drop for the treatment of presbyopia in October 2021. Vuity was launched in December 2021 and is marketed by Allergan, an AbbVie company. The competition also includes reading glasses, multifocal contact lenses, and monovision contact lenses (e.g., where one eye wears a near vision lens and the other eye wears a distance vision lens). Ocuphire will also compete against several pharmacological therapies in development for the temporary treatment of presbyopia, many of which are cholinergic agonist-based pupil management therapies, including:\n\u2022\nCSF-1, with low dose pilocarpine and a secondary agent (lubricant), developed by Orasis Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\n\u2022\nLNZ100 and LNZ101, with aceclidine (another miotic agent), developed by Lenz Therapeutics.\n\u2022\nMicroLine\u00ae, which is a micro-dose delivery of pilocarpine using proprietary device developed by Eyenovia, Inc.\n\u2022\nKT-101, which uses pilocarpine in the AcuStream delivery system, developed by Kedalion Therapeutics, Inc.\n\u2022\nBrimochol\u2122, with brimonidine and carbachol (both are miotic agents), developed by Visus Therapeutics, Inc.\n\u2022\nUNR844, which uses a mechanism that involves softening the lens to increase near visual acuity, developed by Novartis AG (originally Encore Vision, Inc.).\nThere are approved devices for presbyopia. One of these is the KAMRA Inlay, developed by AcuFocus, Inc. and marketed by SightLife Surgical, Inc. Another is the Eyelike NoanPinhole, developed by Koryo Eyetech, the first commercially available pinhole soft contact lens. Nyxol would not directly compete against these devices, but rather would be a non-invasive alternative for presbyopes who are averse to surgical intervention.\nAPX3330\nOcuphire is developing APX3330 for use in two different indications initially: the treatment of DR and DME, and potentially later the treatment of wAMD. In addition to currently approved therapies, any product that is developed for either of the three indications could directly compete directly with APX3330. Such a product could reduce the overall market opportunity for APX3330. Other pharmaceutical companies may develop therapies for the same indications that would compete with APX3330, if approved, and that would not infringe the claims of Ocuphire\u2019s in-licensed patents, pending patent applications, or other proprietary rights, which could adversely affect its business and results of operations.\nCompetition in Diabetic Retinopathy / Diabetic Macular Edema / wAMD\nOcuphire may face potential competition from both existing therapies and those in development. Current therapies for these retinal diseases rely on suppressing VEGF activity via intravitreal injection or by mitigating the inflammation via intravitreal corticosteroid-releasing implants including:\n\u2022\nLucentis\u00ae (ranibizumab) and Avastin\u00ae (bevacizumab), which are anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody intravitreal injections, developed by Genentech, Inc and Roche AG.\n\u2022\nEYLEA\u00ae (aflibercept), a VEGF inhibitor intravitreal injection, developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.\n\u2022\nVabysmo\u00ae (Faricimab), a bispecific monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF-A and Ang-Tie2 pathway developed by Genentech, Inc and Roche AG.\n\u2022\nBeovu\u00ae (Brolucizumab), an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody intravitreal injection, developed by Novartis AG.\n\u2022\nMACUGEN\u00ae (pegaptanib sodium injection), a selective inhibitor of VEGF-165, developed by Bausch + Lomb.\n\u2022\nOzurdex\u00ae (dexamethasone), a corticosteroid IVT implant, developed by Allergan plc.\n\u2022\nIluvien (fluocinolone acetonide), a corticosteroid IVT implant, developed by Alimera Sciences, Inc\nThere are also several pharmacological therapies in development, including:\n\u2022\nAbicipar, an anti-VEGF intravitreal injection with a long duration of action, developed by Allergan plc and Molecular Partners.\n\u2022\nKSI-301, an anti-VEGF antibody intravitreal injection coupled with a biopolymer that is intended to increase the time between injections, developed by Kodiak Sciences.\n\u2022\nOPT-302, an intravitreal injection which binds to multiple types of VEGF receptors that could be used with other anti-VEGF agents, developed by Opthea Limited.\n\u2022\nALG-1001, an integrin peptide therapy intravitreal injection that is being evaluated as a sequential or in-combination therapy with bevacizumab in patients with DME, developed by Allegro Ophthalmics, LLC.\n\u2022\nRG-7774, an orally administered selective CB2 (Cannabinoid 2) receptor agonist that is being evaluated in patients with moderately severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, developed by Hoffmann-LA Roche, AG.\n\u2022\nRZ402, a small molecule selective and potent plasma kallikrein inhibitor (PKI) for the chronic treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME), developed by Rezolute, Inc.\n\u2022\nXiflam\u2122, an oral small molecule drug for the treatment of dry form of Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Geographic Atrophy (GA), Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) manifesting Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), developed by InflammX.\n\u2022\nAKST4290, an oral small molecule CCR3 Eotaxin inhibitor for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy and wet AMD.\n\u2022\nBAY1101042, an oral guanylate cycles activator for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy.\nOcuphire\u2019s competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer, more convenient, or less costly than any that it is developing, or that would render its product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. Ocuphire\u2019s competitors may also render its technologies obsolete by advances in existing technological approaches or the development of new or different approaches, potentially eliminating the advantages in Ocuphire\u2019s drug discovery process. Ocuphire\u2019s competitors may also obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities for its products more rapidly than Ocuphire obtains approval for its products, which could result in Ocuphire\u2019s competitors establishing a strong market position before Ocuphire is able to enter the market.\nMany of Ocuphire\u2019s competitors have significantly greater name recognition, financial resources, and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than Ocuphire does. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of Ocuphire\u2019s competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These companies compete with Ocuphire in recruiting, hiring, and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, engaging contract service providers, manufacturers and consultants, establishing clinical trial sites, recruiting patients for clinical trials, and entering into strategic transactions, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, Ocuphire\u2019s programs.\nOcuphire lacks experience in commercializing products, which may have an adverse effect on its business.\nIf its product candidates receive marketing approval, Ocuphire will need to transition from a company with a development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities, and it may not be successful in making that transition. Ocuphire has never filed an NDA and has not yet demonstrated the ability to obtain marketing approval for, or to commercialize, any product candidate. As a result, its clinical development and regulatory approval activities, and its ability to successfully commercialize any approved products, may involve more inherent risk, take longer, and cost more than would be the case if it were a company with experience obtaining marketing approval for and commercializing a product candidate.\nIf Ocuphire is unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell, market, and distribute its product candidates, if approved, it may not be successful in commercializing such product candidates if and when they are approved.\nOcuphire does not have any sales or marketing infrastructure and has no capabilities in place at the present time for the sale, marketing, or distribution of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any approved product for which it retains sales and marketing responsibilities, Ocuphire must either develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource part or all of these functions to other third parties.\nThere are risks involved with Ocuphire both establishing its own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time-consuming, which could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which Ocuphire recruits a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, it would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and Ocuphire\u2019s investment would be lost if it cannot retain or reposition its sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit Ocuphire\u2019s efforts to commercialize its product candidates on its own include:\n\u2022\nthe inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel or enter into distribution agreements with third parties;\n\u2022\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe its product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put Ocuphire at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines;\n\u2022\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain sufficient coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors and governmental agencies.\n\u2022\nIf it enters into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing, and distribution services, Ocuphire\u2019s product revenues or the profitability of these product revenues to it are likely to be lower than if it were to market and sell a product that Ocuphire developed itself. In addition, Ocuphire may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market any product candidate or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to it. Ocuphire likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market a drug effectively. If Ocuphire does not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on its own or in collaboration with third parties, it will not be successful in commercializing its product candidates.\nOcuphire\u2019s future commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of its product candidates, if approved, among physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community.\nEven if Ocuphire\u2019s product candidates receive marketing approval, they may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors, or others in the medical community. If such product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, Ocuphire may not generate significant product revenues and may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of a product candidate, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nefficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe ability to offer Ocuphire\u2019s product for sale at competitive prices;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022\nany restrictions on the use of Ocuphire\u2019s product together with other medications;\n\u2022\ninteractions of its product with other medicines patients are taking;\n\u2022\ninability of certain types of patients to take Ocuphire\u2019s product;\n\u2022\ndemonstrated ability to treat patients and, if required by any applicable regulatory authority in connection with the approval for target indications as compared with other available therapies;\n\u2022\nthe relative convenience and ease of administration as compared with other treatments available for approved indications;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in the labeling approved by the FDA;\n\u2022\navailability of alternative treatments already approved or expected to be commercially launched in the near future;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of Ocuphire\u2019s sales and marketing strategies;\n\u2022\nOcuphire\u2019s ability to increase awareness through marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nguidelines and recommendations of organizations involved in research, treatment and prevention of various diseases that may advocate for alternative therapies;\n\u2022\nOcuphire\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage; and\n\u2022\nphysicians or patients may be reluctant to switch from existing therapies even if potentially more effective, safe or convenient.\nOcuphire has not yet sold any of its products. Ocuphire cannot assure investors that there is a sufficient market demand for its products. Achieving market acceptance for its products will require substantial marketing efforts and expenditure of funds to create awareness and demand by participants in the industry. Ocuphire has not conducted any independent market research to determine the extent of any demand that exists for the products to be provided by it and there is no guarantee that a sufficient interest in the market will exist for the products and services being produced by, or for, it. Any lack of sufficient demand for the products contemplated to be provided by Ocuphire will have a material adverse effect on it.\nIf the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves generic versions of Ocuphire\u2019s product candidates that receive marketing approval, or if such authorities do not grant Ocuphire\u2019s product candidates appropriate periods of exclusivity before approving generic versions of Ocuphire\u2019s products, the sales of Ocuphire\u2019s products could be adversely affected.\nOnce an NDA is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a \u201creference listed drug\u201d in the FDA\u2019s publication, \u201cApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations.\u201d Manufacturers may seek approval of generic versions of reference listed drugs through submission of abbreviated new drug applications (\u201cANDAs\u201d) in the United States. In support of an ANDA, a generic manufacturer need not conduct clinical studies. Rather, the applicant generally must show that its product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use or labeling as the reference listed drug (\u201cRLD\u201d) and that the generic version is bioequivalent to the RLD, meaning it is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent. Generic products may be significantly less costly to bring to market than the RLD, and companies that produce generic products are generally able to offer them at lower prices. Thus, following the introduction of a generic drug, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product or RLD may be lost to the generic product.\nThe FDA may not approve an ANDA for a generic product until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the reference listed drug has expired. The FDC Act provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity (\u201cNCE\u201d). Specifically, in cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification that a patent covering the reference listed drug is either invalid or will not be infringed by the generic product, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years after approval of the RLD. It is unclear whether the FDA will treat the active ingredients in its product candidates as NCEs and, therefore, afford them five years of NCE exclusivity if they are approved. If any product Ocuphire develops does not receive five years of NCE exclusivity, it may nonetheless be eligible for three years of exclusivity, which means that the FDA may approve generic versions of such product three years after its date of approval. Manufacturers may seek to launch these generic products following the expiration of the applicable marketing exclusivity period, even if Ocuphire still has patent protection for its product.\nCompetition that Ocuphire\u2019s product candidates would face from generic versions could materially and adversely impact its future revenue, profitability, and cash flows and substantially limit its ability to obtain a return on the investments it has made in any such product candidate.\nEven if Ocuphire is able to commercialize its product candidates, their profitability will likely depend in significant part on third-party reimbursement practices, which, if unfavorable, would harm its business.\nOcuphire\u2019s ability to commercialize a drug successfully will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for certain medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Ocuphire cannot be sure that coverage will be available for any product candidate that Ocuphire commercializes and, if coverage is available, whether the level of reimbursement will be adequate. Assuming Ocuphire obtains coverage for its product candidates, if approved, by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or some of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use a product candidate, if approved, unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of its products. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement are critical to new product acceptance. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, Ocuphire may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which it obtains marketing approval. Furthermore, drug pricing and access policies in the United States and internationally may change and negatively impact our product candidates\u2019 commercial viability. Proposed policy changes, including the potential for Medicare to negotiate with drug manufacturers, may limit our ability to competitively price our product candidates, if approved.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which a product candidate is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers Ocuphire\u2019s costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale, and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for a new product, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover Ocuphire\u2019s costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost medicines, and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of medicines from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. However, there is no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often time-consuming and costly, and it will require Ocuphire to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of its products to each payor separately. There is no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.\nAny inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from government-funded or private payors for any approved products that Ocuphire develops could have an adverse effect on its operating results, its ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products, and its overall financial condition.\nProduct liability lawsuits against Ocuphire, or its suppliers and manufacturers, could cause it to incur substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of any product candidate that it may develop.\nOcuphire faces an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of its product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if it commercially sells any products that it may develop. Product liability claims might be brought against Ocuphire by patients, healthcare providers, or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with its product candidates during product testing, manufacturing, marketing, or sale. For example, Ocuphire may be sued under allegations that a product candidate caused injury or that the product was otherwise unsuitable. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of manufacturing or design defects, failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, such as interactions with alcohol or other drugs, negligence, or breach of warranty. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If Ocuphire cannot successfully defend itself against claims that its product candidate caused injuries, it could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for any product candidate that Ocuphire is developing;\n\u2022\ninjury to Ocuphire\u2019s reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\nincreased FDA warnings on product labels;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from Ocuphire\u2019s primary business;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize any product candidate that Ocuphire may develop.\nIts product liability and/or clinical trial insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that Ocuphire may incur. Ocuphire may need to increase its insurance coverage as it expands clinical trials and if it successfully commercializes its product candidates. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive, and it may not be able to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or for a sufficient amount to satisfy liabilities that may arise.\nSimilarly, Ocuphire may be a party to, or may be otherwise responsible for, pending or threatened lawsuits or other claims related to products purchased from its manufacturers and suppliers. Although Ocuphire intends to require its providers to have product liability insurance, the ability to obtain such coverage and the sufficiency thereof is uncertain. Such cases and claims may raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and may be subject to many uncertainties and complexities, including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim, the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought, and differences in applicable law. Such litigation could result in additional expense and exposure in excess of Ocuphire\u2019s anticipated reserves, especially if such matters are not covered by insurance. Upon resolution of any pending legal matters or other claims, Ocuphire may incur charges in excess of established reserves. Product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls in the future, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on the business and reputation and on Ocuphire\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers and strategic partners. The business, profitability and growth prospects could suffer if Ocuphire faces such negative publicity.\nIf Ocuphire or its third-party manufacturers fail to comply with environmental or health and safety laws and regulations, Ocuphire could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have an adverse effect on the success of its business.\nOcuphire\u2019s research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including chemical and biological materials, by itself and its third-party manufacturers. Ocuphire\u2019s manufacturers are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the United States and abroad governing laboratory procedures and the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of medical and hazardous materials. Although Ocuphire believes that its manufacturers\u2019 procedures for using, handling, storing, and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, it cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from medical or hazardous materials. As a result of any such contamination or injury, Ocuphire may incur liability, or federal, state, city, or local authorities may curtail its use of these materials and interrupt its business operations. In the event of an accident, Ocuphire could be held liable for damages or fined, and such liability or fines could exceed its resources. Ocuphire does not have insurance for liabilities arising from medical or hazardous materials. Although Ocuphire maintains workers\u2019 compensation insurance for costs and expenses that it may incur due to injuries to its employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair Ocuphire\u2019s research, development, and production efforts, which could harm its business, prospects, financial condition, or results of operations.\nFederal legislation and actions by state and local governments could permit reimportation of drugs from foreign countries into the United States, which could adversely affect Ocuphire\u2019s operating results when the drugs are sold at lower prices in foreign countries than in the United States.\nOcuphire may face competition for its product candidates, if approved, from other therapies sourced from foreign countries that have price controls on pharmaceutical products. The Medicare Modernization Act contains provisions that may change U.S. reimportation laws and expand pharmacists\u2019 and wholesalers\u2019 ability to import cheaper versions of approved drugs or competing products from Canada, where there are government price controls. These changes to U.S. importation laws would not take effect unless and until the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies that the changes would pose no additional risk to the public\u2019s health and safety and would result in a significant reduction in the cost of products to consumers. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has so far declined to approve a reimportation plan. Proponents of drug reimportation may attempt to pass legislation that would directly allow reimportation under certain circumstances. Legislation or regulations allowing the reimportation of drugs, if enacted, could decrease the price Ocuphire receives for any product it may develop and adversely affect its future revenues and prospects for profitability.\nRisks Related to Ocuphire\u2019s Reliance on Third Parties\nOcuphire will be unable to control all aspects of its non-clinical studies and its clinical trials due to its reliance on CROs and other third parties that assist Ocuphire in conducting non-clinical studies and clinical trials.\nOcuphire relies on third-party CROs and other third parties to assist in managing, monitoring, and otherwise carrying out its non-clinical studies and clinical trials. Ocuphire expects to continue to rely on third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions, and clinical investigators, to conduct its non-clinical studies and clinical trials in the future, including its Phase 3 development program for Nyxol. Ocuphire competes with many other companies for the resources of these third parties.\nAs a result, Ocuphire will have limited control over the conduct, timing, and completion of these non-clinical studies and clinical trials and the management of data developed through the non-clinical studies and clinical trials. Ocuphire has experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, schedule disruptions due to events affecting the performance of third parties on which it relies. Communicating with outside parties can also be challenging, potentially leading to mistakes as well as difficulties in coordinating activities. Additionally, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may affect the ability of third parties to fulfill their obligations to Ocuphire. Outside parties may:\n\u2022\nhave staffing difficulties;\n\u2022\nfail to comply with contractual obligations;\n\u2022\nexperience regulatory compliance issues;\n\u2022\nundergo changes in ownership or management;\n\u2022\nundergo changes in priorities or become financially distressed; or\n\u2022\nform relationships with other entities, some of which may be Ocuphire\u2019s competitors.\nThese factors may adversely affect the willingness or ability of third parties to conduct Ocuphire\u2019s clinical trials and may subject Ocuphire to unexpected cost increases that are beyond its control.\nWhile Ocuphire\u2019s reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce its control over these activities, it will not relieve Ocuphire of its responsibilities and requirements. For example, the FDA requires Ocuphire to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices (\u201cGCP\u201d), for conducting, recording, and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity, and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected.\nProblems with the timeliness or quality of the work of any CRO may lead Ocuphire to seek to terminate its relationship with any such CRO and use an alternative service provider. Making this change may be costly or delay Ocuphire\u2019s clinical trials, and contractual restrictions may make such a change difficult or impossible. If Ocuphire must replace any CRO that is conducting its clinical trials, its clinical trials may have to be suspended until it finds another CRO that offers comparable services. The time that it would take Ocuphire to find alternative organizations may cause a delay in the commercialization of its product candidates, or it may cause it to incur significant expenses to replicate any lost data. Although Ocuphire does not believe that any CRO on which it would rely would offer services that are not available elsewhere, it may be difficult to find a replacement organization that can conduct Ocuphire\u2019s clinical trials in an acceptable manner and at an acceptable cost. Any delay in or inability to complete Ocuphire\u2019s clinical trials could significantly compromise its ability to secure regulatory approval for its product candidates and preclude its ability to commercialize its product candidates, thereby limiting or preventing its ability to generate sales revenue.\nOcuphire relies completely on third parties to supply and manufacture bulk drug substances and to formulate and package preclinical and clinical drug supplies of its product candidates as well as to conduct analytical testing of drug substances and products in the manufacturing processes, and intends to rely on third parties to produce and test commercial supplies of its current and any future product candidates.\nOcuphire does not currently have, nor does it plan to acquire, the infrastructure or capability to internally manufacture its clinical drug supply of product candidates for use in the conduct of its preclinical studies and clinical trials. Ocuphire lacks the internal resources and the capability to manufacture any product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. The process of manufacturing drug products is complex, highly regulated, and subject to several risks. For example, the facilities used by Ocuphire\u2019s contract manufacturers to manufacture and conduct analytical testing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (or drug substance) and final drug product for product candidates must be inspected by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory agencies in connection with Ocuphire\u2019s submission of an NDA or relevant foreign regulatory submission to the applicable regulatory agency. In addition, the manufacturing of drug substance or product is susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, or vendor or operator error. Moreover, the manufacturing facilities in which product candidates are made could be adversely affected by equipment failures, labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures, or other factors. Manufacturing timelines may be negatively affected by material shortages, construction delays and supply chain challenges due to, among other factors, global supply chain shortages due to COVID-19 or other reasons.\nOcuphire does not control the manufacturing and testing processes of its contract manufacturers and analytical labs, and is completely dependent on them to comply with current good manufacturing practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d) for manufacture and good lab practices (\u201cGLP\u201d) of both active drug substances and finished drug products. If Ocuphire\u2019s contract manufacturers and analytical labs cannot successfully manufacture and test materials that conform to its specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agencies, Ocuphire will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for its products. In addition, Ocuphire has no control over its contract manufacturers\u2019 and analytical labs\u2019 ability to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance, and qualified personnel. Failure to satisfy the regulatory requirements for the production and testing of those materials and products may affect the regulatory clearance of Ocuphire\u2019s contract manufacturers\u2019 and analytical labs\u2019 facilities generally. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory agency does not approve these facilities for the manufacture and testing of product candidates, or if it withdraws its approval in the future, Ocuphire may need to find alternative manufacturing and testing facilities, which would adversely impact Ocuphire\u2019s ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, or market product candidates. Furthermore, all of Ocuphire\u2019s contract manufacturers and analytical labs are engaged with other companies to supply and/or manufacture and/or test materials or products for such companies, which exposes its manufacturers to regulatory and sourcing risks for the production of such materials and products. To the extent practicable, Ocuphire attempts to identify more than one supplier. However, some raw materials are available only from a single source or only one supplier has been identified, even in instances where multiple sources exist.\nOcuphire has relied and will rely upon third-party manufacturers and testing labs in the United States and overseas for the manufacture and testing of Nyxol and APX3330 for preclinical and clinical testing purposes and intends to continue to do so in the future for Nyxol, APX3330, Nyxol with adjunctive low-dose pilocarpine, and any other product candidates, including for commercial purposes. If Ocuphire\u2019s third-party manufacturers and analytical labs are unable to supply or test drug substance and/or drug product on a commercial basis, Ocuphire may not be able to successfully produce and market product candidates, if approved, or it could be delayed in doing so. For instance, Ocuphire presently relies on one supplier in Italy for the drug substance for Nyxol, and one manufacturer in India for APX3330 drug substance. If there is any delay or problem with the manufacture of these drug substance or if there is a delay in producing finished drug product from these drug substances, the development and possible approval of Ocuphire\u2019s product candidates and potential commercial launch may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. Ocuphire will rely on comparison of product specifications (identity, strength, quality, and potency) to demonstrate equivalence of the current drug substance and/or drug product to the drug substance and/or drug product used in previously completed preclinical and clinical testing. If Ocuphire is unable to demonstrate such equivalence, it may be required to conduct additional preclinical and/or clinical testing of its product candidates. The formulation of the low-dose pilocarpine as adjunctive product candidate with Nyxol is still in development. Also, due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, disruptions of global supply chains are more likely to occur, which could delay the clinical development of Ocuphire\u2019s product candidates. Ocuphire has already experienced a few interruptions in its manufacturing, supply chain, research and development operations, regulatory and financial position, including, for example, the acceleration of the shipment of active pharmaceutical ingredient supply from overseas.\nDue to these and other potential problems, Ocuphire is exploring the possibility of establishing additional sources of supply, with U.S. manufacturers, for the active pharmaceutical ingredients of both Nyxol and APX3330. Establishing these additional sources, including qualifying their manufacturing processes and demonstrating the equivalence of their products, may be costly, time-consuming, and difficult to effectuate, and may delay Ocuphire\u2019s research and development activities. If Ocuphire must replace any manufacturer, its research and development activities may have to be suspended until it finds another manufacturer that offers comparable services. The time that it takes Ocuphire to find alternative organizations may cause a delay in the development and commercialization of product candidates.\nOcuphire may form or seek strategic alliances or enter into licensing arrangements in the future, and may not realize benefits from such alliances or licensing arrangements.\nOcuphire may form or seek strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third parties that it believes will complement or augment its development and commercialization efforts with respect to product candidates. Any of these relationships may require Ocuphire to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase its near- and long-term expenditures, or issue securities that dilute Ocuphire\u2019s existing stockholders, which may disrupt its management and business. Ocuphire\u2019s likely collaborators include large, mid-size, regional, or national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. If Ocuphire enters into any such arrangements with any third parties, it will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that its collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of product candidates. Ocuphire\u2019s ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on its collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. Ocuphire cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, it will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction. Collaborations involving product candidates pose the following risks to Ocuphire:\n\u2022\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborator\u2019s strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials, or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with its product candidate if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more attractive than Ocuphire\u2019s;\n\u2022\na collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more product candidates may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing or distribution of any such product candidate;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend Ocuphire\u2019s intellectual property rights or may use its proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate Ocuphire\u2019s proprietary information or expose Ocuphire to litigation;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose Ocuphire to litigation and potential liability;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between the Ocuphire and collaborators that result in the delay or termination of research, development, or commercialization of its product candidates, or in litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\n\u2022\nOcuphire may lose certain valuable rights under circumstances identified in its collaborations, including if it undergoes a change of control;\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated and such terminations may create a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may learn about Ocuphire\u2019s discoveries and use this knowledge to compete with Ocuphire in the future;\n\u2022\nthe results of collaborators\u2019 preclinical or clinical studies could harm or impair other development programs;\n\u2022\nthere may be conflicts between different collaborators that could negatively affect those collaborations and potentially others;\n\u2022\nthe number and nature of Ocuphire\u2019s collaborations could adversely affect its attractiveness to potential future collaborators or acquirers;\n\u2022\ncollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of its product candidate in the most efficient manner or at all. If a present or future collaborator of Ocuphire were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on its product development or commercialization program under such collaboration could be delayed, diminished, or terminated; and\n\u2022\ncollaborators may be unable to obtain the necessary marketing approvals.\nIf future collaboration partners fail to develop or effectively commercialize product candidates for any of these reasons, such product candidates may not be approved for sale and Ocuphire\u2019s sales of such product candidates, if approved, may be limited, which would have an adverse effect on Ocuphire\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nIf Ocuphire is not able to establish new collaborations on commercially reasonable terms, it may have to alter its development, manufacturing, and commercialization plans.\nOcuphire faces significant competition in attracting collaborators for development, manufacturing or commercialization plans. Whether it reaches a definitive agreement for collaboration will depend, among other things, upon its assessment of the proposed collaborator\u2019s resources, expertise, and evaluation of a number of factors related to the associated product candidate, as well as the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to Ocuphire\u2019s ownership of technology, which may exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available for collaborations and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than one with Ocuphire. Ocuphire may not be able to enter into these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nMuch of the potential revenue from future commercial collaborations may consist of contingent payments, such as payments for achieving regulatory milestones or royalties payable on sales of Ocuphire\u2019s product candidate, if approved. The milestone and royalty revenue that Ocuphire may receive under these collaborations would depend upon its collaborators\u2019 ability to successfully develop, introduce, market and sell its product candidate, if approved. In addition, collaborators may decide to enter into arrangements with third parties to commercialize products developed under collaborations related to its product candidate, which could reduce the milestone and royalty revenue received, if any.\nOcuphire may also be restricted under existing collaboration agreements from entering into future agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators.\nOcuphire may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis and on acceptable terms, or at all. If Ocuphire is unable to do so, it may have to curtail the development of the product candidate for which it is seeking to collaborate, reduce or delay its development program or that of one or more of its other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase its expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at its own expense. If Ocuphire elects to increase its expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on its own, it may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to Ocuphire on acceptable terms or at all. If Ocuphire does not have sufficient funds, it may not be able to further develop its product candidate or bring it to market and generate product revenue.\nIf Ocuphire engages in acquisitions, in-licensing or strategic partnerships, this may increase its capital requirements, dilute its stockholders, cause it to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject it to other risks.\nOcuphire may engage in various acquisitions and strategic partnerships, including licensing or acquiring complementary products, intellectual property rights, technologies, or businesses. Any acquisition or strategic partnership may entail numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nincreased operating expenses and cash requirements;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of indebtedness or contingent liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of Ocuphire\u2019s equity securities which would result in dilution to Ocuphire stockholders;\n\u2022\nassimilation of operations, intellectual property, products and product candidates of an acquired company, including difficulties associated with integrating new personnel;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from Ocuphire\u2019s existing product candidates and initiatives in pursuing such an acquisition or strategic partnership;\n\u2022\nretention of key employees, the loss of key personnel, and uncertainties in Ocuphire\u2019s ability to maintain key business relationships;\n\u2022\nrisks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction, including the prospects of that party and their existing products or product candidates and regulatory approvals; and\n\u2022\nOcuphire\u2019s inability to generate revenue from acquired intellectual property, technology and/or products sufficient to meet its objectives or even to offset the associated transaction and maintenance costs.\nIn addition, if Ocuphire undertakes such a transaction, it may incur large one-time expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense.\nRisks Related to Ocuphire\u2019s Intellectual Property\nIf Ocuphire is unable to obtain and maintain sufficient patent protection for its product candidates, its competitors could develop and commercialize products or technology similar or identical to those of Ocuphire, which would adversely affect Ocuphire\u2019s ability to successfully commercialize any product candidates it may develop, its business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOcuphire primarily protects its intellectual property through a combination of patents and patent applications on inventions, trademark protection on its product name, and trade secret protection as it deems appropriate.\nAs of March 1, 2022, Ocuphire\u2019s patent estate relating to the Nyxol product candidate contains eight U.S. patents, five pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, two pending U.S. provisional patent applications, as well as issued patents in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, and Mexico and pending patent applications in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, China, and other foreign countries, all of which are owned by Ocuphire.\nOcuphire\u2019s U.S. Patents 9,795,560; 10,278,918; 10,772,829 and 11,090,261 and counterpart Australian, Canadian, European, and Japanese patents each contain composition of matter claims to aqueous phentolamine mesylate formulations and are scheduled to expire in year 2034. In the same patent family, Ocuphire also has 1 pending U.S. patent application with additional claims to aqueous phentolamine mesylate formulations, whereby a patent, if granted, based on this patent application would expire in year 2034. The patents and patent applications cover the current clinical formulation for the Nyxol product.\nOcuphire\u2019s U.S. Patent Nos. 9,089,560; 9,789,088; and 11,000,509 contain claims directed to methods of improving visual performance using, for example, phentolamine mesylate and are scheduled to expire in year 2034. Counterpart patents have issued in Australia, Canada, Europe and Japan, which are scheduled to expire in year 2034. In the same patent family, Ocuphire also has 1 pending U.S. patent application with additional claims to methods of improving visual performance using, for example, phentolamine mesylate, whereby a patent, if granted from this pending patent application, would expire in year 2034. The patents and patent applications cover uses of the current clinical formulation for the Nyxol product.\nOcuphire has patent applications pending in the U.S., Australia, Canada, China, Europe, and Japan directed to treating glaucoma and other medical disorders using phentolamine mesylate. Patents, if granted, based on these pending applications would expire in year 2039.\nOcuphire\u2019s U.S. Patent 10,993,932 contains claims directed to methods of treating presbyopia using phentolamine mesylate in combination with pilocarpine and is scheduled to expire in year 2039. In the same patent family, Ocuphire has two pending U.S. patent applications, one with additional claims to treating presbyopia and the other U.S. application with claims to treating mydriasis. Counterpart patent applications are pending in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, and other foreign countries, whereby a patent, if granted, based on these pending U.S. and foreign patent applications would expire in year 2039.\nOcuphire has a pending U.S. provisional patent application and pending patent application in China directed to methods of making high purity phentolamine mesylate and compositions resulting from such methods. Ocuphire also has a pending U.S. provisional patent application directed to additional methods for treating mydriasis and glaucoma. Patents, if granted, based on these U.S. provisional patent applications would expire in year 2042, and patents, if granted, based on the pending patent application in China would expire in year 2041.\nOcuphire also owns an issued patent in Mexico that is scheduled to expire in year 2025 and has claims to ophthalmic formulations.\nOcuphire has in-licensed a patent estate directed to APX3330 and related compounds that, as of March 1, 2022, contains six U.S. patents, four pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, as well as issued patents in Europe, Japan, Canada, and Australia, and pending patent applications in Europe, Japan, Canada, China, South Korea and Australia. Ocuphire\u2019s in-licensed U.S. patent 9,040,505 has claims to methods of treating diabetic retinopathy and other diseases using, for example, APX3330 and is scheduled to expire in year 2030. Counterpart patents have issued in Europe, Japan, Australia, and Canada, which are scheduled to expire in year 2028, and there is a related pending U.S. patent application with method of treatment claims that, if issued as a patent, would expire in year 2028. Ocuphire\u2019s in-licensed pending U.S. patent application 16,968,009 and pending applications in Europe, Japan, Canada, South Korea and Australia have claims to methods of treating wAMD and other diseases using, for example, APX3330, whereby patents, if granted based on these pending patent applications, would expire in year 2039. Ocuphire\u2019s in-licensed patent applications directed to a combination therapy composition comprising an APE1/REF-1 inhibitor, such as APX3330, and a second therapeutic agent, and are pending in the U.S. and Canada, whereby patents, if granted based on these pending patent applications, would expire in year 2038. In-licensed patent applications directed to use of an APE1/REF-1 inhibitor, such as APX3330, in monotherapy or combination therapy to reduce neuronal sensitivity and/or treat other indications are pending in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Canada, whereby patents, if granted based on these applications, would expire in year 2038. Patents to derivatives of APX3330 have issued in the U.S., Europe, and other countries that are scheduled to expire from year 2028 to 2032, and patent applications to derivatives of APX3330 are pending in Europe and Japan whereby a patent, if granted based on these pending patent applications, would expire in year 2032.\nIn addition to patents and patent applications that Ocuphire has in-licensed, as of March 1, 2022, Ocuphire owns two pending U.S. provisional patent applications directed to methods of treating diabetic retinal diseases using APX3330. Patents, if granted, based on these pending U.S. provisional patent applications would expire in year 2042.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and Ocuphire and its future licensors, licensees, or collaboration partners may not be able to prepare, file, and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that Ocuphire or any future licensors, licensees, or collaboration partners may fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Ocuphire and its licensors\u2019 patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications, and then only to the extent the issued claims cover the technology.\nOcuphire cannot assure you that any of its patents have matured, or that any of its pending patent applications will mature, into issued patents that will include, claims with a scope sufficient to protect its product candidates. Others have developed technologies that may be related or competitive to Ocuphire\u2019s approach, and may have filed or may file patent applications and may have received or may receive patents that overlap or conflict with Ocuphire\u2019s patent applications, for example by claiming the same compounds, methods or formulations or by claiming subject matter that could dominate the patents that Ocuphire owns or in-licenses. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including Ocuphire\u2019s patent position, involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, the issuance, scope, validity, and enforceability of any patent claims that Ocuphire may obtain cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated, or circumvented. U.S. patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference proceedings, ex parte reexamination, or inter partes review proceedings, supplemental examination and challenges in district court. Patents may be subjected to opposition, post-grant review, or comparable proceedings in various national and regional patent offices. These proceedings could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. In addition, such interference, re-examination, opposition, post-grant review, inter partes review, supplemental examination, or revocation proceedings may be costly or time-consuming. Thus, any patents that Ocuphire may own or exclusively license may not provide any protection against competitors. Furthermore, an adverse decision in an interference proceeding can result in a third party receiving the patent right sought by Ocuphire, which in turn could affect its ability to develop, market or otherwise commercialize its product candidates.\nFurthermore, the issuance of a patent, while presumed valid, is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability and it may not provide Ocuphire with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products. Competitors may also be able to design around Ocuphire\u2019s patents. Other parties may develop and obtain patent protection for more effective technologies, designs, or methods. Ocuphire may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of any technical knowledge or trade secrets by consultants, vendors, former employees, or current employees. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States, and Ocuphire may encounter significant problems in protecting its proprietary rights in these countries. If these developments were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on Ocuphire\u2019s sales.\nOcuphire\u2019s ability to enforce its patent rights depends on its ability to detect infringement. It is difficult to detect infringers who do not advertise the components that are used in their products. Moreover, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain evidence of infringement in a competitor\u2019s or potential competitor\u2019s product. Any litigation to enforce or defend Ocuphire\u2019s patent rights, if any, even if Ocuphire were to prevail, could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from Ocuphire\u2019s business operations. Ocuphire may not prevail in any lawsuits that it initiates and the damages or other remedies awarded if it were to prevail may not be commercially meaningful.\nIn addition, proceedings to enforce or defend Ocuphire\u2019s patents could put its patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly. Such proceedings could also provoke third parties to assert claims against Ocuphire, including that some or all of the claims in one or more of Ocuphire\u2019s patents are invalid or otherwise unenforceable. If, in any proceeding, a court invalidated or found unenforceable Ocuphire\u2019s patents covering its product candidates, Ocuphire\u2019s financial position and results of operations would be adversely impacted. In addition, if a court found that valid, enforceable patents held by third parties covered Ocuphire\u2019s product candidates, its financial position and results of operations would also be adversely impacted.\nThe degree of future protection for Ocuphire\u2019s proprietary rights is uncertain, and Ocuphire cannot ensure that:\n\u2022\nany of Ocuphire\u2019s patents, or any of its pending patent applications, if issued, will include claims having a scope sufficient to protect its product candidates;\n\u2022\nany of its pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u2022\nOcuphire will be able to successfully commercialize its product candidates, if approved, before its relevant patents expire;\n\u2022\nOcuphire was the first to make the inventions covered by each of its patents and pending patent applications;\n\u2022\nOcuphire was the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022\nothers will not develop similar or alternative technologies that do not infringe Ocuphire\u2019s patents;\n\u2022\nany of Ocuphire\u2019s patents will be valid and enforceable;\n\u2022\nany patents issued to Ocuphire will provide a basis for an exclusive market for its commercially viable products, will provide Ocuphire with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\u2022\nOcuphire will develop additional proprietary technologies or product candidates that are separately patentable; or\n\u2022\nthat Ocuphire\u2019s commercial activities or products will not infringe upon the patents of others.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. The natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after its effective filing date. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Given the extensive period of time between patent filing and regulatory approval for a product candidate, the time during which Ocuphire can market a product candidate under patent protection is limited, and Ocuphire\u2019s patent may expire before it obtains such approval. Without patent protection for its product candidates, it may be vulnerable to competition from generic versions of its product candidates, which may affect the profitability of its product candidates.\nIf Ocuphire does not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act and similar foreign legislation by extending the patent terms and obtaining data exclusivity for its product candidate, its business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration of regulatory review, and date of FDA marketing approval of its APX3330 or other product candidates, if any, one of such U.S. patents may be eligible for patent term restoration under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides for a patent restoration term, or patent term extension, of up to five years as compensation for the time the product is under FDA regulatory review. The duration of patent term extension is calculated based on the time spent in the regulatory review process. In the future, Ocuphire may plan to seek patent term extension for one or more of its patents related to its APX3330 or other product candidates. However, Ocuphire may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to apply within the applicable deadline, expiration of relevant patents prior to obtaining approval, or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be shorter or less than what Ocuphire requests. If Ocuphire is unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than it requests, Ocuphire\u2019s revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing Ocuphire\u2019s ability to protect its product candidates.\nIn 2011, the United States enacted wide-ranging patent reform legislation with the America Invents Act (\u201cAIA\u201d).\nAn important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after that date but before Ocuphire could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if Ocuphire had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require Ocuphire to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application, but circumstances could prevent Ocuphire from promptly filing patent applications on its inventions.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all of Ocuphire\u2019s U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S. federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate Ocuphire\u2019s patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. The AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of Ocuphire\u2019s patent applications and the enforcement or defense of Ocuphire\u2019s issued patents.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in several patent cases in recent years, such as Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. (Myriad I), Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., and Alice Corporation Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank International, have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty about to Ocuphire\u2019s ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken Ocuphire\u2019s ability to obtain new patents or to enforce Ocuphire\u2019s existing patents and patents that it might obtain in the future.\nOcuphire may not be able to protect or practice its intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nIn jurisdictions where Ocuphire has not obtained patent protection, competitors may use its intellectual property to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where Ocuphire has patent protection, but where it is more difficult to enforce a patent as compared to the United States. Competitor products may compete with Ocuphire\u2019s product candidates in jurisdictions where it does not have issued or granted patents or where its issued or granted patent claims or other intellectual property rights are not sufficient to prevent competitor activities in these jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, make it difficult to enforce patents and such countries may not recognize other types of intellectual property protection, particularly that relating to pharmaceuticals. This could make it difficult for Ocuphire to prevent the infringement of its patents or marketing of competing products in violation of its proprietary rights generally in certain jurisdictions. Proceedings to enforce Ocuphire\u2019s patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert its efforts and attention from other aspects of its business.\nThe laws of some jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the United States, and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in such jurisdictions. If Ocuphire, or any future licensor, encounters difficulties in protecting, or is otherwise precluded from effectively protecting, the intellectual property rights important for its business in such jurisdictions, the value of these rights may be diminished and Ocuphire may face additional competition from others in those jurisdictions. Many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If Ocuphire, or any licensor, is forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to its business, Ocuphire\u2019s competitive position in the relevant jurisdiction may be impaired and its business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOcuphire may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce its patents and other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe Ocuphire\u2019s patents, the patents of its licensing partners, or other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, Ocuphire may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that an Ocuphire patent is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology on the grounds that Ocuphire\u2019s patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of Ocuphire\u2019s patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of Ocuphire\u2019s confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. Moreover, there can be no assurance that Ocuphire will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded.\nLitigation proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may be costly and a distraction to Ocuphire\u2019s management and other employees. Ocuphire may not be able to prevent, alone or with its collaborators, misappropriation of its proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nIn addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of Ocuphire common stock.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that Ocuphire is infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have an adverse effect on the success of Ocuphire\u2019s business.\nOcuphire\u2019s commercial success depends upon its ability and the ability of its collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell its product candidates and use its proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights and intellectual property of third parties. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Ocuphire may in the future become party to, or threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to its medicines and technology, including interference or derivation proceedings, post-grant reviews, inter partes reviews, or other procedures before the USPTO or other similar procedures in foreign jurisdictions. Third parties may assert infringement claims against Ocuphire based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If Ocuphire is found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, it could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing its medicines and technology. However, Ocuphire may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if Ocuphire were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving its competitors and other third parties access to the same technologies licensed to it. Ocuphire could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing and commercializing the infringing technology or medicine. In addition, Ocuphire could be held liable for substantial monetary damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if found to have willfully infringed. A finding of infringement could prevent Ocuphire from commercializing a product candidate or force it to cease some of its business operations, which could harm Ocuphire\u2019s business. Alternatively, Ocuphire may need to redesign its infringing products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Claims that Ocuphire has misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on its business.\nThe cost to Ocuphire of any litigation or other proceeding relating to patent or other proprietary rights, even if resolved in its favor, could be substantial and may result in substantial costs and distraction to Ocuphire\u2019s management and other employees. Some of Ocuphire\u2019s competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than Ocuphire can because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could delay Ocuphire\u2019s research and development efforts and limit its ability to continue its operations.\nOcuphire may be subject to damages resulting from claims that its employees or Ocuphire has wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nOcuphire\u2019s employees and consultants have been previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including its competitors or potential competitors. Although Ocuphire is not aware of any claims currently pending against it, Ocuphire may be subject to claims that these employees or Ocuphire has inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information or intellectual property of the former employers of its employees. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if Ocuphire is successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. If Ocuphire fails in defending such claims, in addition to paying money claims, it may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key personnel or their work product could detract from Ocuphire\u2019s ability to develop or commercialize its product candidates.\nIf Ocuphire is not able to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information, the value of any product it may pursue could be significantly diminished.\nOcuphire may rely upon trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain its competitive position. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Ocuphire relies in part on confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, contract manufacturers, vendors, and other advisors to protect its trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, Ocuphire cannot guarantee that it has executed these agreements with each party that may have or has had access to trade secrets.\nIf a party breaches an agreement and discloses Ocuphire\u2019s proprietary information, including its trade secrets, Ocuphire may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive, and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts in and outside of the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of Ocuphire\u2019s trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, Ocuphire would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they disclose such trade secrets, from using that technology or information to compete with it. If any of Ocuphire\u2019s trade secrets were to be disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor or other third party, Ocuphire\u2019s competitive position would be harmed.\nObtaining and maintaining Ocuphire\u2019s trademark protection depends on approval from the USPTO and other foreign government agencies, and third parties may challenge, infringe, or otherwise weaken Ocuphire\u2019s trademark rights.\nOcuphire has obtained registration of the \u201cNyxol\u201d trademark in the United States. It has not yet registered trademarks for any other product candidates in any jurisdiction. If Ocuphire does not secure and maintain registrations for its trademarks, it may encounter more difficulty in enforcing them against third parties than it otherwise would, which could affect it business. When Ocuphire files trademark applications for a product candidate, those applications may not be allowed for registration, and registered trademarks may not be obtained, maintained, or enforced. During trademark registration proceedings in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, Ocuphire may receive rejections. Ocuphire is given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, but may not be able to overcome such rejections. In addition, the USPTO and comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions allow third parties opportunities to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against Ocuphire\u2019s trademarks and its trademarks may not survive such proceedings.\nIn addition, any proprietary name Ocuphire proposes to use with a future product candidate in the United States must be approved by the FDA, regardless of whether Ocuphire has registered it, or applied to register it, as a trademark. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed drug names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other drug names. If the FDA objects to any proposed proprietary drug name for any product candidate, Ocuphire may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable substitute proprietary drug name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties, and be acceptable to the FDA.\nIf Ocuphire registers any of its trademarks, its trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic, or determined to infringe on other marks. Ocuphire may not be able to protect its rights to these trademarks and trade names or may be forced to stop using these names, which Ocuphire needs for name recognition by potential partners or customers in its markets of interest. If Ocuphire is unable to establish name recognition based on its trademarks and trade names, Ocuphire may not be able to compete effectively, and its business may be adversely affected.\nObtaining and maintaining Ocuphire\u2019s patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by governmental agencies, and its patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment or other provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic maintenance and annuity fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, Ocuphire\u2019s competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have an adverse effect on Ocuphire\u2019s business.\nOcuphire depends on intellectual property sublicensed from Apexian Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\u201cApexian\u201d) for its APX3330 product candidate under development and its additional pipeline candidates, and the termination of, or reduction or loss of rights under, this sublicense would harm Ocuphire\u2019s business.\nOcuphire entered into a sublicense agreement with Apexian (as amended, the \u201cApexian Sublicense Agreement\u201d) to in-license patents and other intellectual property relating to the APX3330 product candidate and second-generation product candidates owned by Apexian, and intellectual property that Apexian in-licensed from Eisai Co., Ltd. (\u201cEisai\u201d) including certain study reports, manufacturing and analytical records, data, know-how, technical and other proprietary information relating to APX3330. The rights granted under the Apexian Sublicense Agreement are subject to various milestone payment, royalty, insurance or other obligations on Ocuphire, and may be revocable under certain circumstances including if Ocuphire ceases to do business, fails to make the payments due thereunder, commits a material breach of the agreement that is not cured within a certain time period after receiving written notice or fails to meet certain specified development and commercial timelines. Termination of the Apexian Sublicense Agreement may result in Ocuphire having to negotiate a new or reinstated agreement, which may not be available to Ocuphire on equally favorable terms, or at all, which may mean Ocuphire is unable to develop or commercialize APX3330 and second-generation assets.\nOcuphire does not have total control over the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of patents and patent applications covering the technology that it licenses under the Apexian Sublicense Agreement. Under the Sublicense Agreement, Indiana University Research and Technology Corp. (\u201cIURTC\u201d), the owner of the patents licensed to Apexian and sublicensed to Ocuphire, maintains the right to control all prosecution and maintenance of such patents. Therefore, Ocuphire cannot always be certain that these patents and patent applications will be prepared, filed, prosecuted and maintained in a manner consistent with the best interests of Ocuphire\u2019s business. Although Ocuphire has a right to have its comments considered in connection with, and has agreed to bear the costs of, the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents, if IURTC fails to prosecute and maintain such patents, or loses rights to those patents or patent applications as a result of its control of the prosecution activities, the rights Ocuphire has licensed may be reduced or eliminated, and Ocuphire\u2019s right to develop and commercialize any of its product candidates that are the subject of such licensed rights could be adversely affected.\nFurther, if Apexian breaches its license agreement with IURTC and fails to cure such breach within a 60-day cure period, IURTC may terminate such license agreement with Apexian, in which case, Ocuphire\u2019s license shall also terminate and Ocuphire will lose all rights under the license agreement with Apexian. While the Apexian Sublicense Agreement provides that Apexian must cooperate with Ocuphire to remedy and cure Apexian\u2019s breach of the license agreement with IURTC in order to prevent the termination of such license agreement, Ocuphire cannot guarantee that such efforts will be successful in preventing the termination of the license agreement between Apexian and IURTC. Similarly, if Apexian breaches its license agreement with Eisai and fails to cure such breach within a 60-day cure period, Eisai may terminate such license agreement with Apexian, in which case, Ocuphire\u2019s sublicense rights under such license shall also terminate. While Ocuphire does not have any material obligations under the license agreement between Eisai and Apexian, Apexian has certain confidentiality and payment obligations that, if not met, could result in breach of the Eisai license agreement.\nUnder Apexian\u2019s license agreement with IURTC, any act or omission by Ocuphire that would be a breach of the license agreement with IURTC if imputed to Apexian is deemed to be a breach by Apexian of such license agreement and cause for termination, including, in particular, any breach by Ocuphire of its payment, reporting, audit, and indemnification obligations.\nThe Apexian Sublicense Agreement obligates Ocuphire to make certain milestone payments.\nOcuphire is obligated to pay certain milestone payments to Apexian pursuant to the Apexian Sublicense Agreement. These milestone payments include (i) payments for specified developmental and regulatory milestones totaling up to $11 million in the aggregate and (ii) payments for specified sales milestones of up to $20 million in the aggregate.\nBecause certain of the milestone payments payable by Ocuphire are due upon certain events related to the development and regulatory approval of its product candidates, Ocuphire may be required to make such payments prior to the time at which it is able to generate revenue, if any, from sales any of its product candidates, if approved. There can be no assurance that Ocuphire will have the funds necessary to make such payments, or be able to raise such funds when needed, on terms acceptable to Ocuphire, or at all. Furthermore, if Ocuphire is forced to raise additional funds, it may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate its product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that it would otherwise develop and market themselves. If Ocuphire is unable to raise additional funds or maintain sufficient liquidity to make its payment obligations if and when they become due, it may be in material breach of its license and acquisition agreements and its counterparties may seek legal action or remedies against Ocuphire, which would harm its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOcuphire may enter into collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances or partnerships with third parties that may not result in the development of commercially viable products or the generation of significant future revenues.\nOcuphire may enter into certain license or other collaboration agreements in the future. Such agreements may impose various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance or other obligations on Ocuphire. If Ocuphire fails to comply with such obligations, Ocuphire\u2019s licensor or collaboration partners may have the right to terminate the relevant agreement, in which event Ocuphire would not be able to develop or market the products covered by such licensed intellectual property. Moreover, disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including:\n\u2022\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which Ocuphire\u2019s product candidates, technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u2022\nthe sublicensing of patent and other rights under Ocuphire\u2019s collaborative development relationships;\n\u2022\nOcuphire\u2019s diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u2022\nthe inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property; and\n\u2022\nthe priority of invention of patented technology.\nIn addition, the agreements under which intellectual property or technology is licensed from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what Ocuphire believes to be the scope of Ocuphire\u2019s rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what Ocuphire believes to be Ocuphire\u2019s financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on Ocuphire\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that Ocuphire has licensed prevent or impair Ocuphire\u2019s ability to maintain Ocuphire\u2019s licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, Ocuphire may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on Ocuphire\u2019s business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nIn addition, Ocuphire cannot be certain that the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance activities by any future licensors have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights.\nRisks Related to Ocuphire\u2019s Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nOcuphire is dependent on its key personnel, and if it is not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, it may not be able to successfully implement its business strategy.\nOcuphire is highly dependent on its management, scientific, and medical personnel, including Mina Sooch, its President, Chief Executive Officer and Board Vice Chair. Ocuphire has entered into employment agreements with its executive officers, but any employee may terminate his or her employment with Ocuphire. The loss of the services of any of Ocuphire\u2019s executive officers, other key employees or consultants, or other scientific and medical advisors in the foreseeable future might impede the achievement of Ocuphire\u2019s research, development, and commercialization objectives. Ocuphire relies on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist it in formulating its development and commercialization strategy. Ocuphire\u2019s consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than Ocuphire and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to Ocuphire. Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel and business and commercial personnel will also be critical to Ocuphire\u2019s success. Ocuphire may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. Ocuphire also experiences competition for the hiring of scientific personnel from universities and research institutions. Failure to succeed in clinical trials may also make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel.\nOcuphire will need to develop and expand its company and may encounter difficulties in managing this development and expansion, which could disrupt its operations.\nAs of March 1, 2022, Ocuphire had nine full-time employees, and Ocuphire expects to increase its number of employees and the scope of its operations as it furthers the clinical development of its product candidates and becomes a public company. To manage its anticipated development and expansion, Ocuphire must continue to implement and improve its managerial, operational, and financial systems, expand its facilities, and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Also, Ocuphire\u2019s management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from its day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these development activities. Due to its limited resources, Ocuphire may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of its operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. This may result in weaknesses in Ocuphire\u2019s infrastructure, and give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees, or reduced productivity among remaining employees. The physical expansion of Ocuphire\u2019s operations may lead to significant costs and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of product candidates. If Ocuphire\u2019s management is unable to effectively manage its expected development and expansion, its expenses may increase more than expected, its ability to generate or increase its revenue could be reduced and it may not be able to implement its business strategy. Ocuphire\u2019s future financial performance and its ability to commercialize product candidates, if approved, and compete effectively will depend, in part, on its ability to effectively manage the future development and expansion of Ocuphire.\nA variety of risks associated with operating internationally for Ocuphire and its collaborators could adversely affect its business.\nIn addition to its U.S. operations, Ocuphire may pursue international operations in the future and would face risks associated with such global operations, including possible unfavorable regulatory, pricing and reimbursement, legal, political, tax, and labor conditions, which could harm its business. Ocuphire plans to conduct clinical trials outside of the United States. Ocuphire is subject to numerous risks associated with international business activities, including:\n\u2022\ncompliance with differing or unexpected regulatory requirements for its product candidates;\n\u2022\ndifferent medical practices and customs affecting acceptance of its product candidates, if approved, or any other approved product in the marketplace;\n\u2022\nlanguage barriers;\n\u2022\nthe interpretation of contractual provisions governed by foreign law in the event of a contract dispute;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, and an inability to control commercial or other activities where it is relying on third parties;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\npotential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act of 1977 or comparable foreign regulations;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capability abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign government taxes, regulations, and permit requirements;\n\u2022\nU.S. and foreign government tariffs, trade restrictions, price and exchange controls, and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, natural disasters, war, events of terrorism, or political instability in particular foreign countries;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration, and labor laws, regulations, and restrictions for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships; and\n\u2022\nchallenges in enforcing its contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and could continue to adversely impact Ocuphire\u2019s business, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity, and result in stock price volatility,\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and continues to cause, a significant adverse effect on the level of economic activity around the world. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments of many countries, states, cities and other geographic regions have taken preventative or protective actions. The actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic have resulted in, and are expected to continue to result in, a curtailment of business activities (including changes in demand for a broad variety of goods and services), labor shortages, disruptions in supply, manufacturing and logistics, economic uncertainty and weakness, and volatility in the financial markets, both in the United States and abroad. Ocuphire has experienced a few disruptions in its manufacturing, supply chain, research and development operations, regulatory process, and financial position. During 2020 and 2021, these disruptions included manufacturing and analytical lab operations (e.g., shipment of active pharmaceutical ingredient supply from Italy and India), clinical trial operations and recruitment, and difficulties in obtaining more favorable financing terms.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the Company\u2019s operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new government actions or restrictions, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the longevity of COVID-19 and its variants and the impact of COVID-19 on economic activity. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the global economy creating certain macroeconomic conditions that make this a particularly challenging business environment for us, including global supply chain instability, inflationary cost increases and labor shortages. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic materially adversely affects the Company\u2019s business and financial results, it may also have the effect of significantly heightening many of the other risks associated with the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price, including in ways that we cannot predict.\nOcuphire\u2019s business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures or unplanned events.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, Ocuphire\u2019s internal computer systems and those of its current and future contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunications and electrical failures. In March 2021, we were the victim of a business email compromise. This fraud did not cause any losses to Ocuphire. If another such event were to occur and cause interruptions in its operations, it could result in a material disruption of Ocuphire\u2019s development programs and its business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in Ocuphire\u2019s regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase Ocuphire\u2019s costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, Ocuphire\u2019s data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, Ocuphire could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of its product candidates could be delayed. We may be required to expend significant resources, fundamentally change our business activities and practices, or modify our operations, including our clinical trial activities, or information technology in an effort to protect against security breaches and to mitigate, detect and remediate actual or potential vulnerabilities.\nFurthermore, any unplanned event, such as flood, fire, explosion, tornadoes, earthquake, extreme weather condition, medical epidemics, power shortage, telecommunications failure, other natural or manmade accidents or incidents, or pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, that result in Ocuphire being unable to fully utilize the facilities, may have an adverse effect on Ocuphire\u2019s ability to operate its business, particularly on a daily basis, and have significant negative consequences on its financial and operating conditions. Loss of access to these facilities may result in increased costs, delays in the development of its product candidates, or interruption of its business operations.\nOcuphire\u2019s insurance policies are expensive and protect only from some business risk, which leaves Ocuphire exposed to significant uninsured liabilities.\nOcuphire does not carry insurance for all categories of risks that its business may encounter, and insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive. Ocuphire does not know if it will be able to maintain existing insurance with adequate levels of coverage, and any liability insurance coverage it acquires in the future may not be sufficient to reimburse the company for any expenses or losses it may suffer. If Ocuphire obtains marketing approval for any product candidates that it may develop, Ocuphire intends to acquire insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products, but it may be unable to obtain such insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts. Required coverage limits for such insurances are difficult to predict and may not be sufficient. If potential losses exceed Ocuphire\u2019s insurance coverage, its financial condition would be adversely affected. In the event of contamination or injury, Ocuphire could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding its resources. Clinical trials or regulatory approvals for any of its product candidates could be suspended, which could adversely affect Ocuphire\u2019s results of operations and business, including by preventing or limiting the development and commercialization of any product candidates that the company or its collaborators may develop.\nIn addition, as a public company, it may be more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Ocuphire Common Stock\nOcuphire does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe current expectation is that Ocuphire will retain its future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of its business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of its common stock will be investors\u2019 sole source of gain, if any, for the foreseeable future.\nIf Ocuphire fails to comply with the continued listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market, Ocuphire common stock could be delisted. If it is delisted, the liquidity of Ocuphire\u2019s common stock would be impacted.\nThe continued listing of Ocuphire common stock on Nasdaq is contingent on Ocuphire\u2019s continued compliance with a number of listing standards. There is no assurance that Ocuphire will remain in compliance with these standards. Delisting from Nasdaq would adversely affect Ocuphire\u2019s ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, significantly affect the ability of investors to trade Ocuphire\u2019s securities and negatively affect the value and liquidity of Ocuphire\u2019s common stock. Delisting also could limit Ocuphire\u2019s strategic alternatives and attractiveness to potential counterparties and have other negative results, including the potential loss of employee confidence, the loss of institutional investors or interest in business development opportunities.\nIn addition, if our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market and the trading price remains below $5.00 per share, trading in our common stock might also become subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Exchange Act, which require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trade involving a stock defined as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d (generally, any equity security not listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on Nasdaq that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions).\nThe market price of Ocuphire common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of Ocuphire common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to factors, some of which are beyond Ocuphire\u2019s control, such as:\n\u2022\nthe announcement of new products or product enhancements by Ocuphire or its competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in Ocuphire\u2019s relationships with its licensors or other strategic partners;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning intellectual property rights and regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nvariations in Ocuphire\u2019s and Ocuphire\u2019s competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022\nsubstantial sales of shares of our common stock due to the release of lock-up agreements;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of clinical trial results;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of potentially dilutive financings;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems; and\n\u2022\ndevelopments and market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFurther, the stock market, in general, and the market for biotechnology companies, in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Continued market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of Ocuphire\u2019s common stock, which may be unrelated or disproportionate to Ocuphire\u2019s operating performance and which could cause a decline in the value of Ocuphire\u2019s common stock.\nOcuphire may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nThe market price of Ocuphire common stock may be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. Ocuphire may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against Ocuphire could result in substantial costs and direct Ocuphire management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm Ocuphire\u2019s business.", "PERMNO": 92665, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "REXN"}
