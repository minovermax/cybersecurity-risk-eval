RISK FACTORS\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock or debt securities.\nCommodity prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prices we receive for the oil, natural gas and NGLs that we sell. Lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can produce economically. Historically, commodity prices have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. For example, the WTI oil prices in 2021 ranged from a high of $84.65 to a low of $47.62 per Bbl and NYMEX natural gas prices in 2021 ranged from a high of $23.86 (during Winter Storm Uri) to a low of $2.43 per Mmbtu. Any substantial or extended decline in future commodity prices would have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and commitments. Furthermore, substantial, extended decreases in commodity prices may cause us to delay or postpone a significant portion of our exploration and development projects or may render such projects uneconomic, which may result in significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could negatively impact our ability to borrow and cost of capital and our ability to access capital markets, increase our costs under our revolving credit facility and limit our ability to execute aspects of our business plans. Refer to \u201cFuture commodity price declines may result in write-downs of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\u201d\nWide fluctuations in commodity prices may result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include but are not limited to the following:\n\u2022the levels and location of oil, natural gas and NGLs supply and demand and expectations regarding supply and demand, including the potential long-term impact of an abundance of natural gas from shale (such as that produced from our Marcellus Shale properties) on the global natural gas supply;\n\u2022the level of consumer demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs, which has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly during 2020;\n\u2022weather conditions and seasonal trends;\n\u2022political, economic or health conditions in oil, natural gas and NGL producing regions, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and the U.S., including for example, the impacts of local or international pandemics and disasters or events such as the global COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the ability and willingness of the members of OPEC+ to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022the price level and quantities of foreign imports;\n\u2022actions of governmental authorities;\n\u2022the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering, transportation, processing and/or refining facilities in regional or local areas;\n\u2022inventory storage levels and the cost and availability of storage and transportation of oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation, including environmental and climate change regulation;\n\u2022the price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels;\n\u2022technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022speculation by investors in oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022variations between product prices at sales points and applicable index prices; and\n\u2022overall economic conditions, including the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other major currencies.\nThese factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict future commodity prices. If commodity prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time, the lower prices may cause us to reduce our planned drilling program or adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures, raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations.\nDrilling oil and natural gas wells is a high-risk activity.\nOur growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program. Drilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022decreases in commodity prices;\n\u2022unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022equipment failures or accidents, including blowouts, explosions and fires;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022surface access restrictions;\n\u2022loss of title or other title related issues;\n\u2022lack of available gathering or processing facilities or delays in the construction thereof;\n\u2022compliance with, or changes in, governmental requirements and regulation, including with respect to wastewater disposal, discharge of greenhouse gases and fracturing;\n\u2022unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressure or irregularities in formations; and\n\u2022costs of shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment and materials.\nOur future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. Our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate within a particular geographic area may decline. We may be unable to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame, or at all. We may be unable to lease or drill a particular prospect because, in some cases, we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location. Similarly, our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget. The final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the results of exploration efforts and the acquisition, review and analysis of seismic data;\n\u2022the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospects;\n\u2022the approval of the prospects by other participants after additional data has been compiled;\n\u2022economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, including prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs and crews;\n\u2022our financial resources and results; and\n\u2022the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects and any delays in obtaining such permits.\nThese projects may not be successfully developed and the wells, if drilled, may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive oil or natural gas.\nBusiness disruptions from unexpected events, including pandemics, health crises and natural disasters, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including a public health crisis, pandemic and epidemic, war or civil unrest, a terrorist act, a cybersecurity incident resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive information or causing data or\nsystems to be unusable, a weather event, an earthquake or other catastrophe could cause instability in world financial markets and lead to increased volatility in prices for oil and natural gas, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in widespread adverse impacts on the global economy. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to spread, including new strains of COVID-19 such as the Delta and Omicron variants, the global availability and efficacy of treatments and vaccines and boosters and the acceptance of such treatments and vaccines by a significant portion of the population, and the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of the virus, such as quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business and government shutdowns (whether through a continuation of existing measures or the re-imposition of prior measures). The worldwide vaccine rollouts in 2021 have allowed governments to ease COVID-19 restrictions and lockdown protocols; however, the recent increase in COVID-19 cases resulting from the Delta and Omicron variants has created questions about whether lockdown protocols must be adjusted and the ultimate impact of those variants is unknown. We have implemented preventative measures and developed response plans intended to minimize unnecessary risk of exposure to infection among our employees at our work sites, and we continue to assess and plan for various operational contingencies related to COVID-19. However, if a significant portion of our employees or contractors or the employees or contractors of the operators of pipelines, processing and other facilities we utilize or of our vendors or suppliers were unable to work due to illness or if our field operations were suspended or temporarily restricted due to control measures designed to contain the outbreak, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we cannot guarantee that any precautionary actions taken by us will be effective in preventing disruptions to our business. In the event of any significant resurgence in COVID-19 transmission and infection in the areas in which we operate, our non-operational employees may return to working remotely, which could increase the risk of security breaches or other cyber-incidents or attacks, loss of data, fraud and other disruptions as a consequence of more employees accessing sensitive and critical information from remote locations via network infrastructure and internet services not arranged, established or secured by us.\nAdditionally, vaccination and testing requirements related to COVID-19 could impact our business in the future. In September 2021, the OSHA was directed to implement an emergency temporary standard requiring employers with 100 or more employees to ensure their workforce is fully vaccinated or to require unvaccinated workers to produce a negative COVID-19 test result on at least a weekly basis. Although the U.S. Supreme Court recently blocked the implementation of the standard, the future implementation of similar mandatory vaccination and testing requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the event that, among other things, a significant portion of our workforce does not choose to become vaccinated, the costs related to mandatory testing for unvaccinated employees are significant or the time away from work for testing is disruptive to our operations.\nFurthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant reduction in demand for crude oil, and to a lesser extent, natural gas and NGLs during much of 2020. The supply/demand imbalance driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and production disagreements in March 2020 among members of OPEC+ led to a significant global economic contraction generally in 2020 and continued to have disruptive impacts on our industry in 2021. Although an agreement to cut production was subsequently announced by OPEC+, the situation, coupled with the impact of COVID-19 and storage and transportation capacity constraints, resulted in a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry. We cannot predict the full impact that COVID-19 and its variants or the significant disruption and volatility currently being experienced in the oil and natural gas markets will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations at this time due to numerous uncertainties. For example, the operations of our midstream service providers, on whom we rely for the transmission, gathering and processing of a significant portion of our produced oil, natural gas and NGLs, may be disrupted or suspended in response to containing outbreaks, and/or the economic challenges may lead to a reduction in capacity or closing of the facilities and infrastructure of our midstream service providers, which may result in substantial discounts in the prices we receive for our produced oil, natural gas or NGLs or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for our properties. Although we have not received notices from our customers or counterparties regarding non-performance issues or delays resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, to the extent we or any of our material suppliers or customers are unable to operate due to government restrictions or otherwise, we may have to temporarily shut down or reduce production, which could result in significant downtime and have significant adverse consequences for our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted supply chains, delaying deliveries of supplies and equipment and increasing costs. Our costs for services, labor and supplies increased during 2021 due to increased demand for those items and supply chain disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ultimate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on future developments, including, among others, the ultimate severity of the virus, any resurgence in COVID-19 transmission and infection in affected regions after they have begun to experience improvements, the consequences of governmental and other measures, the efficacy of treatments and vaccines and boosters and the success of vaccination programs, the duration of the outbreak, further actions taken by members of OPEC+, actions taken by governmental authorities, customers, suppliers and other third parties, workforce availability and the timing and extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resume.\nOur proved reserves are estimates. Any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated.\nReserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as assumptions relating to commodity prices. Additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Furthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data.\nResults of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate. Accordingly, initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered, and such variances may be material. Any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month average index price for the respective commodity, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate. In addition, the 10 percent discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general.\nFuture commodity price declines may result in write-downs of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe value of our oil and gas properties depends on commodity prices. Declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs, changes in well performance, delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding write-down of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties.\nWe evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a field-by-field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a property's carrying amount may not be recoverable. We compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. If the future undiscounted expected cash flows, based on our estimate of future commodity prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. In the event that commodity prices decline, there could be a significant revision to the carrying amounts of oil and gas properties in the future.\nOur future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable.\nIn general, the production rate of oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. Unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce, our reserves will decline, eventually resulting in a decrease in oil and natural gas production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations. Our future production is, therefore, highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. We may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration, development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs. Low commodity prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop and produce economically.\nWe estimate that production from our proved developed reserves as of December 31, 2021 will decrease at a rate of 24 percent, 17 percent and 13 percent during 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively (although production from our proved developed reserves is expected to increase during 2022 due to the effects of the Merger, partially offset by natural decline rates). Future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves that we have not currently classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline.\nExploration, development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in, among other things, dry holes, the failure to produce oil, natural gas and NGLs in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves.\nThe development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 26 percent of our estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped. These reserve estimates reflect our plans to make capital expenditures for estimated future development costs of $2.1 billion to convert our PUD reserves into proved developed reserves. Developing PUD reserves requires significant capital expenditures, and the estimated future development costs associated with our PUD reserves may not equal our actual costs, development may not occur as scheduled and results of our development activities may not be as estimated. If we choose not to develop our PUD reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to develop them successfully, we will be required to remove them from our reported proved reserves. In addition, under the SEC\u2019s reserve reporting rules, because PUD reserves generally may be recorded only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking, we may be required to remove any PUD reserves that are no longer planned to be developed within this five-year time frame.\nStrategic determinations, including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities, are challenging, and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate.\nOur future growth prospects depend on our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business. In developing our business plans, we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our business including well-development (primarily drilling), reserve acquisitions, exploratory activity, corporate items and other alternatives. We also consider our likely sources of capital. Notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2022 plan, business opportunities not previously identified periodically may come to our attention, including possible acquisitions and dispositions. If we fail to identify optimal business strategies, or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies, our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected. Moreover, economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2022 plan, and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives.\nOur ability to sell our oil, natural gas and NGL production and/or the prices we receive for our production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing.\nThe sale of our oil, natural gas and NGL production depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities. We deliver the majority of our oil, natural gas and NGL production through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own. The lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. Third-party systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons, and in some cases the resulting curtailments of production could lead to payment being required where we fail to deliver oil, natural gas and NGLs to meet minimum volume commitments. In addition, construction of new pipelines and building of required infrastructure may be slow to build out. To the extent these services are unavailable, we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production. Our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business.\nMoreover, these availability and capacity issues are more likely to occur in remote areas with less established infrastructure, such as our Delaware Basin properties where we have significant oil and natural gas production. Any of these availability or capacity issues, whether resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, construction delays, government restrictions, adverse weather conditions (such as the severe winter storm that impacted Texas and Oklahoma in February 2021), fire or other reasons, could negatively affect our operations, revenues and expenses. In addition, the Marcellus Shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates. The amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells, as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells, may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available. In such an event, this could result in wells being shut in or awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity and/or natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on NYMEX or than we currently project, which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nAcquired properties may not be worth what we pay to acquire them, due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits, as well as potential liabilities.\nSuccessful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control. These factors include estimates of recoverable reserves, exploration potential, future commodity prices, operating costs, production taxes and\npotential environmental and other liabilities. These assessments are complex and inherently imprecise. Our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems. In addition, our review may not allow us to assess fully the potential deficiencies of the properties. We do not inspect every well, and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural, subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise.\nThere may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation or other matters of which we are unaware, which could materially and adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. We often assume certain liabilities, and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities, and our contractual indemnification may not be effective. At times, we acquire interests in properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties. In addition, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties.\nThe integration of the businesses and properties we have acquired or may in the future acquire could be difficult, and may divert management's attention away from our existing operations.\nThe integration of the businesses and properties we have acquired, including via the Merger, or may in the future acquire could be difficult, and may divert management's attention and financial resources away from our existing operations. These difficulties include:\n\u2022the challenge of integrating the acquired businesses and properties while carrying on the ongoing operations of our business;\n\u2022the inability to retain key employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022the challenge of inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies of the acquired business;\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities, unforeseen expenses or higher-than-expected integration costs;\n\u2022an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated;\n\u2022potential lack of operating experience in a geographic market of the acquired properties; and\n\u2022the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations.\nIf management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage our expanded business, which may pose substantial challenges for management. We may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of the increase in the size of our business. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in our integration efforts.\nWe face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses.\nOur business involves a variety of operating risks, including:\n\u2022well site blowouts, cratering and explosions;\n\u2022equipment failures;\n\u2022pipe or cement failures and casing collapses, which can release oil, natural gas, drilling fluids or hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u2022uncontrolled flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids;\n\u2022pipeline ruptures;\n\u2022fires;\n\u2022formations with abnormal pressures;\n\u2022handling and disposal of materials, including drilling fluids and hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u2022release of toxic gas;\n\u2022buildup of naturally occurring radioactive materials;\n\u2022pollution and other environmental risks, including conditions caused by previous owners or operators of our properties; and\n\u2022natural disasters.\nAny of these events could result in injury or loss of human life, loss of hydrocarbons, significant damage to or destruction of property, environmental pollution, natural resource damages, regulatory investigations and penalties, suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us.\nOur utilization of oil and natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks, including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures. The location of pipelines near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase these risks.\nWe have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.\nOther companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest. As of December 31, 2021, non-operated wells represented approximately 68 percent of our total owned gross wells, or 18 percent of our owned net wells. We have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non-operated properties and on properties we operate in joint ventures in which we may share control with third parties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them. The failure of an operator of our wells or joint venture participant to adequately perform operations, an operator's breach of the applicable agreements or an operator's failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners, including a joint venture participant, for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs.\nMany of our properties are in areas that may have been partially depleted or drained by offset wells and certain of our wells may be adversely affected by actions other operators may take when drilling, completing or operating wells that they own.\nMany of our properties are in areas that may have been partially depleted or drained by earlier offset drilling. We have no control over offsetting operators, who could take actions, such as drilling and completing additional wells, which could adversely affect our operations. When a new well is completed and produced, the pressure differential in the vicinity of the wellbore causes the migration of reservoir fluids toward the new wellbore (and potentially away from existing wellbores), which could cause a depletion of our proved reserves and may inhibit our ability to further develop our proved reserves. The possibility for these impacts may increase with respect to wells that are shut in as a response to lower commodity prices or the lack of pipeline and storage capacity. In addition, completion operations and other activities conducted on other nearby wells could cause us, in order to protect our existing wells, to shut in production for indefinite periods of time. Shutting in our wells and damage to our wells from offset completions could result in increased costs and could adversely affect the reserves and re-commenced production from such shut in wells.\nWe may lose leases if production is not established within the time periods specified in the leases or if we do not maintain production in paying quantities.\nWe could lose leases under certain circumstances if we do not maintain production in paying quantities or meet other lease requirements, and the amounts we spent for those leases could be lost. If we shut in wells in response to lower commodity prices or a lack of pipeline and storage capacity, we may face claims that we are not complying with lease provisions. In addition, the Biden administration also may impose new restrictions and regulations affecting our ability to drill, conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, and obtain necessary rights-of-way on federal lands, which could, in turn, result in the loss of federal leases. The combined net acreage expiring over the next three years represents approximately one percent of our total net undeveloped acreage as of December 31, 2021. Our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business.\nCyber-attacks targeting our systems, the oil and gas industry systems and infrastructure or the systems of our third-party service providers could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and the oil and gas industry in general have become increasingly dependent on digital data, computer networks and connected infrastructure, including technologies that are managed by third-party providers on whom we rely to help us collect, host or process information. We depend on this technology to record and store financial data, estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, analyze and share operating data and communicate internally and externally. Computers control\nnearly all of the oil and gas distribution systems in the U.S., which are necessary to transport our products to market. Computers also enable communications and provide a host of other support services for our business. In recent years (and, in large part, due to the COVID-19 pandemic), we have increased the use of remote networking and online conferencing services and technologies that enable employees to work outside of our corporate infrastructure, which exposes us to additional cybersecurity risks, including unauthorized access to sensitive information as a result of increased remote access and other cybersecurity related incidents.\nCyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, phishing, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information, customer or employee data or other proprietary or commercially sensitive information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption or other disruptions in our exploration or production operations or planned business transactions, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations. If our information technology systems cease to function properly or are breached, we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations, which may include drilling, completion, production and corporate functions. A cyber-attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business associates, could result in supply chain disruptions that delay or prevent the transportation and marketing of our production, non-compliance leading to regulatory fines or penalties, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our or any of our customer\u2019s or supplier\u2019s data or confidential information that could harm our business by damaging our reputation, subjecting us to potential financial or legal liability and requiring us to incur significant costs, including costs to repair or restore our systems and data or to take other remedial steps.\nIn addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period, and our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against such cybersecurity risks may be costly and may not be sufficient. As cyber-attackers become more sophisticated, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to protect our business or remediate the damage from cyber-attacks. Furthermore, the continuing and evolving threat of cyber-attacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention, and we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. To the extent we face increased regulatory requirements, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness, Hedging Activities and Financial Position\nWe have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nWe make and expect to make substantial capital expenditures in connection with our development and production projects. We rely on access to both our revolving credit facility and longer-term capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations or other sources. Future challenges in the global financial system, including the capital markets, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and access to capital. Our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire, or need, to raise capital, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. Adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection. In addition, there have been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves, which, if successful, could limit our ability to access capital markets. For example, in October 2020, JP Morgan Chase & Co. announced that it was adopting a financing commitment that is aligned to the goals of the Paris climate accord of 2015 (the \u201cParis Agreement\u201d). Other banks have made climate-related pledges for various causes, such as stopping the financing of Arctic drilling and coal companies. These initiatives by activists and banks, including certain banks who are parties to the credit agreement providing for our revolving credit facility, could interfere with our business activities, operations and ability to access capital. Future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for oil and natural gas, which could have a negative impact on our revenues.\nRisks associated with our debt and the provisions of our debt agreements could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $3.1 billion of debt outstanding (with a principal amount of $2.9 billion) and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Following the Merger, our legacy revolving credit facility and private placement senior notes remained outstanding. In addition, on October 7, 2021, we completed an exchange offer, whereby we issued $1.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of new senior notes in exchange for $1.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of previously outstanding Cimarex senior notes. Following completion of that exchange offer, approximately $200 million in aggregate principal amount of Cimarex senior notes remained outstanding. The increase in our indebtedness as a result of the Merger and related transactions could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including by:\n\u2022requiring us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to make debt service payments, which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, returning free cash flow to stockholders and future business opportunities;\n\u2022increasing the risk of default on debt obligations;\n\u2022limiting our ability to sell assets, engage in strategic transactions or obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate and other purposes;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with lower debt-service obligations;\n\u2022increasing our exposure to a rise in interest rates, which would generate greater interest expense to the extent we do not have applicable interest rate fluctuation hedges;\n\u2022depending on the levels of our outstanding debt, limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate and other purposes; and\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, including declines in commodity prices, economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the oil and gas industries could be impaired. If we fail to make required payments or otherwise default on our debt, the lenders who hold such debt also could accelerate amounts due, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of other debt.\nIn addition, the margins we pay under our revolving credit facility depend on (1) the credit rating of our debt, at times when our debt has an investment grade credit rating and (2) our leverage ratio, at times when our debt does not have an investment grade rating. Accordingly, adverse changes in our leverage ratio or the credit rating of our debt may result in an increase in our interest expense.\nOur debt agreements also require compliance with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios. If commodity prices deteriorate from current levels, it could lead to reduced revenues, cash flow and earnings, which in turn could lead to a default due to lack of covenant compliance. Because the calculations of the financial ratios are made as of certain dates, the financial ratios can fluctuate significantly from period to period. A prolonged period of lower commodity prices could further increase the risk of our inability to comply with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios. In order to provide a margin of comfort with regard to these financial covenants, we may seek to reduce our capital expenditures, sell non-strategic assets or opportunistically modify or increase our derivative instruments to the extent permitted under our debt agreements. In addition, we may seek to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully execute any of these strategies, and such strategies may be unavailable on favorable terms or at all. For more information about our debt agreements, please read \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Financial Condition-Capital Resources and Liquidity.\u201d\nWe may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for oil and natural gas.\nFrom time to time, when we believe that market conditions are favorable, we use financial derivative instruments to manage price risk associated with our oil and natural gas production. While there are many different types of derivatives\navailable, we generally utilize collar, swap, roll differential swap and basis swap agreements to manage price risk more effectively. In addition, to mitigate a portion of its exposure to changes in commodity prices, Cimarex historically hedged oil and natural gas prices from time to time, primarily through the use of certain derivative instruments. Upon completion of the Merger, we assumed Cimarex\u2019s existing hedges, such that we will now bear the economic impact of those hedges.\nThe collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period. They provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor. The swap agreements call for payments to, or receipts from, counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place. These arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices. In addition, these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances, including when:\n\u2022there is an adverse change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for our production;\n\u2022production is less than expected; or\n\u2022a counterparty is unable to satisfy its obligations.\nThe CFTC has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions. These regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties. Although we believe that our use of swap transactions exempt us from certain regulatory requirements, the changes to the swap market due to increased regulation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps, materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions and/or reduce the availability of new or existing swaps. If we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and implementing regulations thereunder, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable.\nIn addition, the use of financial derivative instruments involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. We are unable to predict changes in a counterparty\u2019s creditworthiness or ability to perform, and even if we could predict such changes accurately, our ability to negate such risk may be limited depending on market conditions and the contractual terms of the instruments. If any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations under our financial derivative instruments, such a default could (1) have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, (2) result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes and (3) increase the likelihood that our financial derivative instruments may not achieve their intended strategic purposes.\nWe will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future. Please read \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 and \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d in Item 7A for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives.\nLegal, Regulatory and Governmental Risks\nESG concerns or negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our business operations and the price of our common stock.\nBusinesses across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from investors, stockholders and the public related to their ESG practices. Failure, or a perceived failure, to adequately respond to or meet evolving investor, stockholder or public ESG expectations, concerns and standards may cause a business entity to suffer reputational damage and materially and adversely affect the entity\u2019s business, financial condition, and/or stock price. In addition, organizations that provide ESG information to investors have developed ratings processes for evaluating a business entity\u2019s approach to ESG matters. Although currently no universal rating standards exist, the importance of sustainability evaluations is becoming more broadly accepted by investors and stockholders, with some using these ratings to inform investment and voting decisions. Additionally, certain investors use these scores to benchmark businesses against their peers and, if a business entity is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with the entity to require improved ESG disclosure or performance. Moreover, certain members of the broader investment community may consider a business entity's sustainability score as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision. Consequently, a low sustainability score could result in exclusion of our common stock from consideration by certain investment funds, engagement by investors seeking to improve such scores and a negative perception of our operations by certain investors.\nFurther, negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about climate change impacts of methane and other greenhouse gas emissions, hydraulic fracturing, oil\nspills, and pipeline explosions coupled with increasing societal expectations on businesses to address climate change and potential consumer use of substitutes to carbon-intensive energy commodities may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our oil, natural gas and NGL production, reduced profits, increased regulation, regulatory investigations and litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. These factors could also cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be challenged, withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business.\nFederal, state and local laws and regulations, judicial actions and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development and the use of hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including drilling and environmental and safety laws and regulations, which increase the cost of planning, designing, drilling, installing and operating oil and natural gas facilities. New laws and regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could further increase these costs, could increase our liability risks, and could result in increased restrictions on oil and gas production activities, which could have a material adverse effect on us and the oil and gas industry as a whole. Risk of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental and safety matters in particular, including compliance issues, environmental contamination and claims for damages to persons or property, are inherent in oil and natural gas operations. Failure to comply with applicable environmental and safety laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action requirements and orders. In addition, applicable laws and regulations require us to obtain many permits for the operation of various facilities. The issuance of required permits is not guaranteed and, once issued, permits are subject to revocation, modification and renewal. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in fines and penalties or require us to incur substantial costs to remedy violations.\nMost of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells. This technology involves the injection of fluids-usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives-as well as sand or other proppants into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore. Most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well. If existing laws and regulations with regard to hydraulic fracturing are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations through judicial or administrative actions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Further, state and federal regulatory agencies have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity in recent years. Similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In March 2016, the U.S. Geological Survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arkansas. These concerns have further increased regulatory scrutiny on hydraulic fracturing as well as oil and gas waste injection wells and led to the adoption of state and local laws regulating such activities. We cannot predict whether additional federal, state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing or oil and gas waste injection wells will be enacted in the future and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. These concerns also could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal, which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities, including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. In addition, if existing laws and regulations with regard to hydraulic fracturing are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations through judicial or administrative actions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nSome of our producing wells and associated facilities are subject to restrictive air emission limitations and permitting requirements. Two examples are the EPA\u2019s source aggregation rule and the EPA\u2019s New Source Performance Standards (\u201cNSPS\u201d) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (\u201cNESHAP\u201d). In June 2016, the EPA published a final rule concerning aggregation of sources that affects source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry, and, as a result, aggregating our oil and gas facilities for permitting could result in more complex, costly, and time-consuming air permitting and cause delays in our operations. In August 2012 and June 2016, the EPA published rules establishing new air emission control requirements for the oil and natural gas sector, including NSPS to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and to regulate methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry, and NESHAP to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities. Although these rules were stayed and ultimately carved back by a September 2020 EPA rule, on June 30, 2021, President Biden signed into law a joint Congressional resolution under the Congressional Review Act disapproving the September 2020 rule. On November 15, 2021, the EPA proposed rules to reduce methane emissions from both new and existing oil and natural gas\nindustry sources. Compliance with the 2012 and 2016 NSPS for the oil and gas sector and any additional requirements imposed by new EPA regulations, particularly a new methane regulation, may require modifications to certain of our operations or increase the cost of new or modified facilities, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site, which could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and adversely impact our business.\nFor additional information, please read \u201cBusiness and Properties-Other Business Matters-Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Exploration and Production,\u201d \u201c-Regulation of Natural Gas Marketing, Gathering and Transportation,\u201d and \u201c-Environmental and Safety Regulations\u201d in Items 1 and 2.\nOil and natural gas production operations, especially those using hydraulic fracturing, are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Our ability to produce oil and natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner.\nWater is an essential component of oil and natural gas production during the drilling process. In particular, we use a significant amount of water in the hydraulic fracturing process. Our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations, could adversely impact our operations. For water sourcing, we first seek to use non-potable water supplies for our operational needs. In certain areas, there may be insufficient local aquifer capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities. Water must then be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site. An inability to secure sufficient amounts of water or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations could adversely impact our operations in certain areas. Compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nFor additional information, please read \u201cBusiness and Properties-Other Business Matters-Environmental and Safety Regulations-Clean Water Act\u201d in Items 1 and 2.\nThe adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emission of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and gas we produce.\nStudies have found that emission of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases (\u201cGHG\u201d), impact the earth\u2019s climate. The U.S. Congress and various states have been evaluating, and in some cases implementing, climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that restrict emissions of GHGs. In the absence of significant federal GHG legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged, aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions through cap-and-trade programs, which typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting GHGs. On January 20, 2021, his first day in office, President Biden signed an executive order on climate action and reconvened an interagency working group to establish social costs of three GHGs: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane. Carbon dioxide is released during the combustion of fossil fuels, including oil, natural gas, and NGLs, and methane is a primary component of natural gas. The Biden administration stated it will use updated social cost figures to inform federal regulations and major agency actions and to justify aggressive climate action as the U.S. moves toward a \u201c100% clean energy\u201d economy with net-zero GHG emissions. These actions as well as any future laws or regulations that regulate or limit emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to both develop and implement new practices aimed at reducing GHG emissions, such as emissions control technologies, and monitor and report GHG emissions associated with our operations, any of which could increase our operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the oil and gas that we produce. At this time, it is not possible to quantify the impact of such future laws and regulations on our business.\nFor additional information, please read \u201cBusiness and Properties-Other Business Matters-Environmental and Safety Regulations-Greenhouse Gas and Climate Change Laws and Regulations\u201d in Items 1 and 2.\nWe are subject to various climate-related risks.\nThe following is a summary of potential climate-related risks that could adversely affect us:\nTransition Risks. Transition risks are related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy and include policy and legal, technology, and market risks.\nPolicy and Legal Risks. Policy risks include actions that seek to lessen activities that contribute to adverse effects of climate change or to promote adaptation to climate change. These policy actions potentially could be accelerated with a\nDemocratic party in control of Congress and the Presidency. Examples of policy actions that would increase the costs of our operations or lower demand for our oil and gas include implementing carbon-pricing mechanisms, shifting energy use toward lower emission sources, adopting energy-efficiency solutions, encouraging greater water efficiency measures, and promoting more sustainable land-use practices. Policy actions also may include restrictions or bans on oil and gas activities, which could lead to write-downs or impairments of our assets. Legal risks include potential lawsuits claiming failure to mitigate impacts of climate change, failure to adapt to climate change, and the insufficiency of disclosure around material financial risks.\nFurthermore, we also could also face an increased risk of climate-related litigation or \u201cgreenwashing\u201d suits with respect to our operations, disclosures, or products. Claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that GHG emissions from oil, gas and NGL operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and state law. Private individuals or public entities also could attempt to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could seek personal injury and property damages or other remedies. Additionally, governments and private parties are also increasingly filing suits, or initiating regulatory action, based on allegations that certain public statements regarding ESG-related matters by companies are false and misleading \u201cgreenwashing\u201d campaigns that violate deceptive trade practices and consumer protection statutes or that climate-related disclosures made by companies are inadequate. Similar issues can also arise when aspirational statements such as net-zero or carbon neutrality targets are made without clear plans. Although we are not a party to any such climate-related or \u201cgreenwashing\u201d litigation currently, unfavorable rulings against us in any such case brought against us in the future could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nTechnology Risks. Technological improvements or innovations that support the transition to a lower-carbon, more energy efficient economic system may have a significant impact on us. The development and use of emerging technologies in renewable energy, battery storage, and energy efficiency may lower demand for oil and gas, resulting in lower prices and revenues, and higher costs. In addition, many automobile manufacturers have announced plans to shift production from internal combustion engine to electric powered vehicles, and states and foreign countries have announced bans on sales of internal combustion engine vehicles beginning as early as 2025, which would reduce demand for oil.\nMarket Risks. Markets could be affected by climate change through shifts in supply and demand for certain commodities, especially carbon-intensive commodities such as oil and gas and other products dependent on oil and gas. Lower demand for our oil and gas production could result in lower prices and lower revenues. Market risk also may take the form of limited access to capital as investors shift investments to less carbon-intensive industries and alternative energy industries. In addition, investment advisers, banks, and certain sovereign wealth, pension, and endowment funds recently have been promoting divestment of investments in fossil fuel companies and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction, production, and sale of oil and gas. For additional information, please read \u201c-Risks Related to our Indebtedness, Hedging Activities and Financial Position-We have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all\u201d in this Item.\nReputation Risk. Climate change is a potential source of reputational risk, which is tied to changing customer or community perceptions of an organization\u2019s contribution to, or detraction from, the transition to a lower-carbon economy. For additional information, please read \u201c-ESG concerns or negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our business operations and the price of our common stock.\u201d\nPhysical Risks. Potential physical risks resulting from climate change may be event driven (including increased severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, or floods) or may be driven by longer-term shifts in climate patterns that may cause sea level rise or chronic heat waves. Potential physical risks may cause direct damage to assets and indirect impacts, such as supply chain disruption, and also could include changes in water availability, sourcing, and quality, which could impact drilling and completion operations. These physical risks could cause increased costs, production disruptions, lower revenues and substantially increase the cost or limit the availability of insurance.\nWe are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws, rules and directives (collectively, data protection laws) relating to the processing of personal data.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding data protection laws is uncertain. Complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and violations of applicable data protection laws can result in significant penalties. A determination that there have been violations of applicable data protection laws could expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could materially harm our business and reputation.\nAny failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with applicable data protection laws could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance and adversely affect our business. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches, which themselves may result in a\nviolation of these laws. Additionally, the acquisition of a company that is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws may result in a violation of these laws.\nTax law changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nSubstantive changes to existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that, if adopted, would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by U.S. oil and gas companies and would impose new taxes. The proposals include: repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties; elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred; and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers. Additional proposed general tax law changes include raising tax rates on both domestic and foreign income and imposing a new alternative minimum tax on book income. Further, many states are currently in deficits, and have been enacting laws eliminating or limiting certain deductions, carryforwards and credits in order to increase tax revenue.\nShould the U.S. or the states pass tax legislation limiting any currently allowed tax incentives and deductions, our taxes would increase, potentially significantly, which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows. This could also reduce our drilling activities in the U.S. Since future changes to federal and state tax legislation and regulations are unknown, we cannot predict the ultimate impact such changes may have on our business.\nAdditional Risks Related to the Merger\nThe Merger may result in a loss of customers, distributors, service providers, suppliers, vendors, joint venture participants and other business counterparties and may result in the termination of existing contracts.\nAs a result of the Merger, some of our and Cimarex's legacy customers, distributors, service providers, suppliers, vendors, joint venture participants and other business counterparties may terminate or scale back their current or prospective business relationships with the combined business. If relationships with customers, distributors, service providers, suppliers, vendors, joint venture participants and other business counterparties are adversely affected by the Merger, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger.\nThe long-term success of the Merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our two businesses and operational synergies. The anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize than expected, may not be realized or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee. Some of the assumptions that we have made, such as the achievement of the anticipated benefits related to the geographic, commodity and asset diversification and the expected size, scale, inventory and financial strength of the combined business, may not be realized. In addition, there could be potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the Merger that could adversely impact us.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate for various reasons and may decline if large amounts of our common stock are sold following the Merger.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future and holders of our common stock could lose some or all of the value of their investment. As a result of the Merger, we issued approximately 408.2 million shares of our common stock to former Cimarex stockholders (excluding shares that were awarded in replacement of previously outstanding Cimarex restricted share awards). The Merger Agreement contained no restrictions on the ability of former Cimarex stockholders or our historic stockholders to sell or otherwise dispose of shares of our common stock. Former Cimarex stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of our common stock that they received in the Merger, and our historic stockholders may decide to reduce their investment in us as a result of the changes to our investment profile as a result of the Merger. These sales of our common stock (or the perception that these sales may occur) could have the effect of depressing the market price for our common stock. In addition, with the completion of the Merger, our financial position is different from our financial position before the completion of the Merger, and our future results of operations and cash flows will be affected by factors different from those that previously affected our results of operations and cash flows, all of which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent times which, if they continue to occur, could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nOur ability to utilize Cimarex's historic net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited.\nOn October 1, 2021, we completed the Merger, and as a result, we acquired Cimarex\u2019s U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and other tax attributes. Our ability to utilize these NOLs and other tax attributes to reduce future taxable income depends on many factors, including future income, which cannot be assured. Section 382 of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (\"Section 382\"), generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOLs and other tax attributes that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone an \"ownership change\" (as determined under Section 382). An ownership change generally occurs if one or more stockholders (or groups of stockholders) who are each deemed to own at least 5 percent of such corporation's stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period.\nAs a result of the Merger, an ownership change occurred with respect to Cimarex under Section 382, which triggered a limitation on our ability to utilize Cimarex's historic NOLs and other tax attributes and could cause some of those NOLs and other tax attributes to expire unutilized. This annual limitation under Section 382 is determined by multiplying (1) the fair market value of Cimarex's stock at the time of the Merger by (2) the long-term tax exempt rate published by the Internal Revenue Service for the month in which the Merger occurred, subject to certain adjustments (provided that any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years). In addition, the NOLs Cimarex acquired in 2019 as part of its acquisition of Resolute Energy Corporation are already subject to a Section 382 limitation.\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cIncome Taxes,\u201d included in Item 8 for more information regarding Cimarex\u2019s historic NOL carryforwards and the Section 382 limitation.\nRisks Related to our Corporate Structure\nProvisions of Delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change-in-control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment.\nOur charter authorizes our Board of Directors to set the terms of preferred stock. In addition, Delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties. Our bylaws prohibit the calling of a special meeting by our stockholders and place procedural requirements and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders. Because of these provisions of our charter, bylaws and Delaware law, persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than pursue non-negotiated takeover attempts. As a result, these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent Board of Directors.\nThe personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the Delaware General Corporation Law and by our charter.\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors' duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission. Our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Specifically, our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability:\n\u2022for any breach of their duty of loyalty to the Company or our stockholders;\n\u2022for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;\n\u2022under provisions relating to unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions; and\n\u2022for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.\nThis limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors, and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited our stockholders.\nThe exclusive-forum provision contained in our bylaws could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, other employee or agent of Coterra to Coterra or our stockholders, including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our bylaws or charter or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine or asserting an \"internal corporate claim\" shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the U.S. federal district court for the District of Delaware).\nTo the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, this exclusive-forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, including claims under the federal securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. This exclusive-forum provision may limit the ability of a stockholder to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find this exclusive-forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, stockholders who do bring a claim in a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. In addition, the court located in the State of Delaware may reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nOur operations depend on a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel, and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment. The change in control and severance benefits triggered by the Merger may provide incentive for key management and technical personnel to leave our company. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us. In addition, our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists, engineers and other professionals. Competition for experienced geologists, engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense and can be exacerbated following a downturn in which talented professionals leave the industry or when potential new entrants to the industry decide not to undertake the professional training to enter the industry. This has occurred as a result of the downturn in commodity prices in 2020 and previous downturns and as a result of initiatives to move from oil and gas to alternative energy sources. If we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.\nWe may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed.\nWe maintain insurance against some, but not all, operating risks and losses. We do not carry business interruption insurance. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The cost of insurance may increase, and the availability of insurance may decrease, as a result of climate change or other factors.\nCompetition in our industry is intense, and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense. Major and independent oil and natural gas companies actively bid for desirable oil and gas properties, as well as for the capital, equipment, labor and infrastructure required to operate and develop these properties. Our competitive position is affected by price, contract terms and quality of service, including pipeline connection times, distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record. Many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours. These companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive oil and gas properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry. These companies may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low oil and natural gas prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation.\nFurther, driven in part by reduced commodity prices related to the global COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our competitors may engage in bankruptcy proceedings, debt refinancing transactions, management changes or other strategic initiatives in an attempt to reduce operating costs to maintain a position in the market. This could result in such competitors emerging with stronger or healthier balance sheets and in turn an improved ability to compete with us in the future. We have seen and may continue to see corporate consolidations among our competitors, which could significantly alter industry conditions and competition within the industry.\nBecause our activity is concentrated in areas of heavy industry competition, there is heightened demand for equipment, power, services, facilities and resources, resulting in higher costs than in other areas. Such intense competition also could result in delays in securing, or the inability to secure, the equipment, power, services, resources or facilities necessary for our development activities, which could negatively impact our production volumes. In remote areas, vendors also can charge higher rates due to the inability to attract employees to those areas and the vendors\u2019 ability to deploy their resources in easier-to-access areas.\nThe declaration, payment and amounts of future dividends distributed to our stockholders will be uncertain.\nAlthough we have paid cash dividends on shares of common stock in the past, our Board of Directors may determine not to declare dividends in the future or may reduce the amount of dividends paid in the future. Decisions on whether, when and in which amounts to declare and pay any future dividends will remain in the discretion of our Board of Directors. Any dividend payment amounts will be determined by our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and it is possible that our Board of Directors may increase or decrease the amount of dividends paid in the future, or determine not to declare dividends in the future, at any time and for any reason. We expect that any such decisions will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, cash balances, cash requirements, future prospects, the outlook for commodity prices and other considerations that our Board of Directors deems relevant, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022whether we have enough cash to pay such dividends due to our cash requirements, capital spending plans, cash flows or financial position;\n\u2022our desire to maintain or improve the credit ratings on our debt; and\n\u2022applicable restrictions under Delaware law.\nOur common stockholders should be aware that they have no contractual or other legal right to dividends that have not been declared.", "PERMNO": 76082, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "COG"}
