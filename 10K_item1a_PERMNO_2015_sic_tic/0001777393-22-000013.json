{"cik": "1777393", "company": "ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-04-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in ChargePoint\u2019s securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. ChargePoint\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be harmed by any of these risks, as well as other risks not known to ChargePoint or that it considers immaterial as of the date of this Annual Report. The trading price of ChargePoint\u2019s securities could decline due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment.\nSummary of Principal Risks Associated with ChargePoint\u2019s Business\n\u2022ChargePoint operates in the early-stage market of electric vehicle adoption and has a history of losses and expects to incur significant expenses and continuing losses for the near term.\n\u2022ChargePoint has experienced rapid growth and expects to invest in growth for the foreseeable future. If it fails to manage growth effectively, its business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\u2022ChargePoint currently faces competition from a number of companies, particularly in Europe, and expects to face significant competition in the future as the market for EV charging develops.\n\u2022Failure to effectively expand ChargePoint\u2019s sales and marketing capabilities could harm its ability to increase its customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of its solutions.\n\u2022ChargePoint faces risks related to health pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which could have a material and adverse effect on its business and results of operations.\n\u2022Supply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, and adversely effect ChargePoint\u2019s business and results of operations. For example, supply chain challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic and global chip shortages have impacted companies worldwide and may have adverse effects on ChargePoint\u2019s suppliers and, as a result, ChargePoint.\n\u2022ChargePoint relies on a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers for its charging stations. A loss of any of these partners could negatively affect its business.\n\u2022ChargePoint\u2019s business is subject to risks associated with construction, cost overruns and delays, and other contingencies that may arise in the course of completing installations, and such risks may increase in the future as ChargePoint expands the scope of such services with other parties.\n\u2022Acquisitions or strategic investments could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of key management personnel, disrupt ChargePoint\u2019s business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022If ChargePoint is unable to attract and retain key employees and hire qualified management, technical engineering and sale personnel, its ability to compete and successfully grow its business would be harmed.\n\u2022ChargePoint is expanding operations internationally, particularly in Europe, which will expose it to additional tax, compliance, market and other risks.\n\u2022Some members of ChargePoint\u2019s management have limited experience in operating a public company.\n\u2022Future sales of ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could reduce ChargePoint\u2019s stock price, and any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute existing stockholder\u2019s ownership.\n\u2022ChargePoint\u2019s future revenue growth will depend in significant part on its ability to increase sales of its products and services to fleet operators.\n\u2022ChargePoint\u2019s information technology systems or data, or those of its service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences.\n\u2022Computer malware, viruses, ransomware, hacking, phishing attacks and similar disruptions could result in security and privacy breaches and interruption in service, which could harm ChargePoint\u2019s business.\n\u2022ChargePoint\u2019s headquarters and other facilities are located in an active earthquake zone; an earthquake or other types of natural disasters or resource shortages, including public safety power shut-offs that have occurred and may continue to occur in California, could disrupt and harm its operations and those of ChargePoint\u2019s customers.\n\u2022ChargePoint has never paid cash dividends on its capital stock and does not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\n\u2022The price of ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock may be subject to wide fluctuations.\n\u2022Concentration of ownership among ChargePoint\u2019s existing executive officers, directors and their affiliate may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\n\u2022ChargePoint\u2019s future growth and success is highly correlated with and thus dependent upon the continuing rapid adoption of EVs for passenger and fleet applications.\n\u2022The EV market currently benefits from the availability of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives from governments, utilities and others to offset the purchase or operating cost of EVs and EV charging stations.\n\u2022ChargePoint\u2019s business may be adversely affected if it is unable to protect its technology and intellectual property from unauthorized use by third parties.\n\u2022ChargePoint has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. If ChargePoint is unable to remediate these material weaknesses, or if ChargePoint identifies additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fails to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, this may result in material misstatements of ChargePoint\u2019s consolidated financial statements or cause ChargePoint to fail to meet its periodic reporting obligations.\nRisks Related to ChargePoint\u2019s Business\nChargePoint operates in the early-stage market of electric vehicle adoption and has a history of losses, and expects to incur significant expenses and continuing losses for the near term.\nChargePoint incurred net losses of $132.2 million, $197.0 million, and $134.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, ChargePoint had an accumulated deficit of $811.7 million and $679.4 million, respectively. ChargePoint believes it will continue to incur significant operating expenses and net losses in future quarters for the near term. There can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain profitability in the future. ChargePoint\u2019s potential profitability is particularly dependent upon the continued adoption of EVs by consumers and fleet operators, the widespread adoption of electric trucks, other vehicles and other electric transportation modalities, which are still in the very early stages of adoption and may not occur.\nChargePoint has experienced rapid growth and expects to invest in growth for the foreseeable future. If it fails to manage growth effectively, its business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nChargePoint has experienced rapid growth in recent periods. For example, the number of employees has grown from 743 as of January 31, 2020 to 834 as of January 31, 2021 and to 1,436 as of January 31, 2022. The growth and expansion of its business has placed and continues to place a significant strain on management, operations, financial infrastructure and corporate culture. In the event of further growth, ChargePoint\u2019s information technology systems and ChargePoint\u2019s internal control over financial reporting and procedures may not be adequate to support its operations and may introduce opportunities for data security incidents that may interrupt business operations and permit bad actors to obtain unauthorized access to business information or misappropriate funds. ChargePoint may also face risks to the extent such bad actors infiltrate the information technology infrastructure of its contractors.\nTo manage growth in operations and personnel, ChargePoint will need to continue to improve its operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures. Failure to manage growth effectively could result in difficulty or delays in attracting new customers, declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, difficulties in introducing new products and\nservices or enhancing existing products and services, loss of customers, inability to retain or hire new employees effectively, information security vulnerabilities or other operational difficulties, any of which could adversely affect its business performance and operating results.\nChargePoint currently faces competition from a number of companies, particularly in Europe, and expects to face significant competition in the future as the market for EV charging develops.\nThe EV charging market is relatively new and competition is still developing. ChargePoint primarily competes with smaller providers of EV charging station networks for installations, particularly in Europe. Large early-stage markets, such as Europe, require early engagement across verticals and customers to gain market share, and ongoing effort to scale channels, installers, teams and processes. Some European customers require solutions not yet available and ChargePoint\u2019s recent entrance into Europe requires establishing itself against existing competitors. In addition, there are multiple competitors in Europe with limited funding, which could cause poor experiences, hampering overall EV adoption or trust in any particular provider.\nIn addition, there are other means for charging EVs, which could affect the level of demand for onsite charging capabilities at businesses. For example, Tesla Inc. continues to build out its supercharger network across the United States for its vehicles, which could reduce overall demand for EV charging at other sites. Also, third-party contractors can provide basic electric charging capabilities to potential customers seeking to have on premise EV charging capability as well as for home charging. In addition, many EV charging manufacturers, including ChargePoint, are offering home charging equipment, which could reduce demand for on premise charging capabilities of potential customers and reduce the demand for onsite charging capabilities if EV owners find charging at home to be sufficient.\nFurther, ChargePoint\u2019s current or potential competitors may be acquired by third-parties with greater available resources. In addition, certain of ChargePoint\u2019s competitors are engaging in or have completed transactions to become a publicly-traded company and may have ready access to the capital markets for additional funding. As a result, competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than ChargePoint to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements and may have the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition. In addition, competitors may in the future establish cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary products, technologies or services to increase the availability of their solutions in the marketplace. This competition may also materialize in the form of costly intellectual property disputes or litigation.\nNew competitors or alliances may emerge in the future that have greater market share, more widely adopted proprietary technologies, greater marketing expertise and greater financial resources, which could put ChargePoint at a competitive disadvantage. Future competitors could also be better positioned to serve certain segments of ChargePoint\u2019s current or future target markets, which could create price pressure. In light of these factors, even if ChargePoint\u2019s offerings are more effective and higher quality than those of its competitors, current or potential customers may accept competitive solutions. If ChargePoint fails to adapt to changing market conditions or continue to compete successfully with current charging providers or new competitors, its growth will be limited which would adversely affect its business and results of operations.\nFailure to effectively expand ChargePoint\u2019s sales and marketing capabilities could harm its ability to increase its customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of its solutions.\nChargePoint\u2019s ability to grow its customer base, achieve broader market acceptance, grow revenue, and achieve and sustain profitability will depend, to a significant extent, on its ability to effectively expand its sales and marketing operations and activities. Sales and marketing expenses represent a significant percentage of its total revenue, and its operating results will suffer if sales and marketing expenditures do not contribute significantly to increasing revenue.\nChargePoint is substantially dependent on its direct sales force to obtain new customers. ChargePoint plans to continue to expand its direct sales force both domestically and internationally but it may not be able to recruit and hire a sufficient number of sales personnel, which may adversely affect its ability to expand its sales capabilities. New hires require significant training and time before they achieve full productivity, particularly in new sales territories. Recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as quickly as anticipated and ChargePoint may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. Furthermore, hiring sales personnel in new countries can be costly, complex and time-consuming, and requires additional set up and upfront costs that may be disproportionate to the initial revenue expected from those countries. There is significant competition for direct sales personnel with strong sales skills and technical knowledge. ChargePoint\u2019s ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend, in large part, on its success in recruiting, training, incentivizing and retaining a sufficient number of qualified direct sales personnel and on such personnel attaining desired productivity levels within a reasonable amount of time. ChargePoint\u2019s business will be harmed if continuing investment in its sales and marketing capabilities does not generate a significant increase in revenue.\nChargePoint faces risks related to health pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which could have a material and adverse effect on its business and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility in the global economy. Global trade conditions and consumer trends that have originated during the pandemic continue to persist and may have a long-lasting adverse impact on ChargePoint and its industry. For example, the pandemic has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the COVID-19 virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns. While these\nmeasures may be relaxed or revised in some areas, there is no guarantee these measures will not be reinstated or resumed due to additional variants of COVID-19 or the inability or ineffectiveness of public health measures to limit the further spread of COVID-19. These measures may adversely impact ChargePoint\u2019s employees and operations and the operations of its customers, suppliers, vendors and business partners, and may negatively impact demand for EV charging stations, particularly at workplaces. These measures by government authorities, or the risks that the measures may be reinstated or resumed, may remain in place for a significant period of time and may adversely affect manufacturing and building plans, sales and marketing activities, business and results of operations.\nDuring 2020, 2021, and continuing in 2022, ChargePoint modified its business practices by recommending that all non-essential personnel work from home and cancelling or reducing physical participation in sales activities, meetings, events and conferences. ChargePoint has also implemented additional safety protocols for workers and cost cutting measures to reduce operating costs. ChargePoint may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that it determines are in the best interests of its employees, customers, suppliers, vendors and business partners, including acting to lift or re-impose initiatives. There is no certainty that such actions will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities. If significant portions of ChargePoint\u2019s workforce are unable to work effectively, including due to illness, quarantines, social distancing, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, its operations will be negatively impacted. Furthermore, if significant portions of ChargePoint\u2019s customers\u2019 or potential customers\u2019 workforces are subject to stay-at-home orders or otherwise have substantial numbers of their employees working remotely for sustained periods of time, user demand for charging stations and services will decline. In addition, measures imposed by governments, may adversely impact ChargePoint\u2019s employees and operations and the operations of its customers, suppliers, vendors and business partners, and may negatively impact demand for EV charging stations, particularly at workplaces.\nAs stated above, non-essential ChargePoint personnel have been working from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although ChargePoint has commenced a \u201creturn-to-office\u201d plan, which includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, ChargePoint has not yet set a return-to-office-date in light of the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. A hybrid work model may create challenges, including challenges maintaining ChargePoint\u2019s corporate culture, increasing attrition or limiting ChargePoint\u2019s ability to attract employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home, or if there are instances of COVID-19 infections at the office. Future challenges related to ChargePoint\u2019s \u201creturn-to-office\u201d plans, hybrid work model or workplace practices could lead to attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.\nThe effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on ChargePoint\u2019s business, prospects and results of operations will depend on the direction and duration of current global trends and their sustained impact. Difficult macroeconomic conditions, such as decreases in direct federal economic support, such as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) , increased inflation, increased and prolonged unemployment or a decline in consumer confidence as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as reduced spending by businesses, could have a material adverse effect on the demand for ChargePoint\u2019s products and services. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic can also vary over time and across the geographies in which ChargePoint operates. For example, variations in work-from-home policies can cause fluctuations in revenues, and ChargePoint believes that people have not yet fully returned back to offices. The conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as more permanent work-from-home policies, are likely to continue affecting the rate of global infrastructure spending, and thus to continue to adversely impact ChargePoint\u2019s gross margins as ChargePoint\u2019s commercial business contributes higher margins than its residential and fleet businesses. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, ChargePoint may continue to experience an adverse impact to its business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nSupply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, and adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s business and results of operations. For example, supply chain challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic and global chip shortages have impacted companies worldwide and may have adverse effects on ChargePoint suppliers and, as a result, ChargePoint.\nChargePoint depends on the timely supply of materials, services and related products to meet the demands of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of materials and services from suppliers and contract manufacturers. Significant or sudden increases in demand for EV charging stations, as well as worldwide demand for the raw materials and services that ChargePoint requires to manufacture and sell EV charging stations, including component parts, may result in a shortage of such materials or may cause shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints. Such shortages or delays could adversely impact ChargePoint\u2019s suppliers\u2019 ability to meet ChargePoint\u2019s demand requirements.\nDisruptions in the manufacturing, delivery and overall supply chain of vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, such as exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in additional costs and, to a lesser extent, component shortages, and have led to fluctuations in EV sales in markets around the world. Increased demand for personal electronics and trade restrictions that affect raw materials have contributed to a shortfall of semiconductor chips, which has caused additional supply challenges both within and outside of ChargePoint\u2019s industry. Ongoing supply chain challenges and heightened logistics costs have adversely affected ChargePoint\u2019s gross margins in recent quarters and ChargePoint expects that gross margins will continue to be adversely affected by increased material costs and freight and logistic expenses for the foreseeable future. Costs incurred to expedite delivery of components used in charging stations or in providing installation or maintenance services or to proactively increase inventory could cause ChargePoint to raise its prices, impose surcharges or other fees or refuse to negotiate discounts. Further, any sustained downturn in demand for EVs would also harm ChargePoint\u2019s business.\nChargePoint may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver products, or increased costs as a result of:\n\u2022the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials on a cost-effective basis; volatility in the availability and cost of materials or services, including rising prices due to inflation;\n\u2022shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints, such as reduced availability of air or ground transport or port closures;\n\u2022information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third party supplier or service provider;\n\u2022difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;\n\u2022natural disasters or other events beyond ChargePoint\u2019s control (such as earthquakes, utility interruptions, tsunamis, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, storms or extreme weather conditions, fires, regional economic downturns, regional or global health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic); and\n\u2022geopolitical turmoil, including the ongoing invasion of the Ukraine by Russia or increased trade restrictions between the United States, Russia, China and other countries, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or other acts of war which may further adversely impact supply chains, shipping, transportation and logistics disruptions.\nAs more fully discussed in the risk factor \u201cRisks Related to ChargePoint\u2019s Business - ChargePoint faces risks related to health pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have a material and adverse effect on its business and results of operations\u201d, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread, including quarantines, facility closures, travel and logistics restrictions, border controls, and shelter in place or stay at home and social distancing orders, have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact ChargePoint\u2019s supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce and operations, as well as the operations of its customers and suppliers globally. In addition, while ChargePoint has not yet experienced a direct impact to its supply chain due to the conflict between Russia and the Ukraine, ChargePoint may experience an impact in the future due to increased fuel and shipping costs, limited supply of components or parts used by ChargePoint in its manufacturing process, or the automotive industry in general, and delays caused by changes to global shipping routes and logistics. Such adverse impacts on ChargePoint\u2019s supply chain could limit its ability to manufacture and sell its products on a timely and cost-effective basis and adversely affect its gross margins, which could materially adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s business and results of operations.\nChargePoint relies on a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers for its charging stations. A loss of any of these partners could negatively affect its business.\nChargePoint relies on a limited number of suppliers to manufacture its charging stations, including in some cases only a single supplier for some products and components. This reliance on a limited number of manufacturers increases ChargePoint\u2019s risks, since it does not currently have proven reliable alternatives or replacement manufacturers beyond these key parties. In the event of interruption, including or resulting in a sudden failure by a supplier to meet its obligation, ChargePoint may not be able to increase capacity from other sources or develop alternate or secondary sources without incurring material additional costs and substantial delays. Thus, ChargePoint\u2019s business could be adversely affected if one or more of its suppliers is impacted by any interruption at a particular location.\nIf ChargePoint experiences a significant increase in demand for its charging stations in future periods, or if it needs to replace an existing supplier, it may not be possible to supplement or replace them on acceptable terms, which may undermine its ability to deliver products to customers in a timely manner. For example, it may take a significant amount of time to identify a manufacturer that has the capability and resources to build charging stations in sufficient volume. Identifying suitable suppliers and manufacturers could be an extensive process that requires ChargePoint to become satisfied with their quality control, technical capabilities, responsiveness and service, financial stability, regulatory compliance, and labor and other ethical practices. Accordingly, a loss of any significant suppliers or manufacturers could have an adverse effect on ChargePoint\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, ChargePoint\u2019s suppliers may face supply chain risks and constraints of their own, which may impact the availability and pricing of its products. For example, supply chain challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic discussed above and the global chip shortages that have impacted companies worldwide both within and outside of ChargePoint\u2019s industry may have adverse effects on its suppliers and, as a result, ChargePoint.\nIn addition, in fiscal year 2022, ChargePoint became subject to requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) to diligence, disclose and report whether or not its products contain minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries, or conflict minerals. ChargePoint will incur additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in ChargePoint\u2019s products. These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the components used in ChargePoint\u2019s products. It is also possible that ChargePoint\u2019s reputation may be adversely affected if it determines that certain of its products contain minerals not determined to be conflict-free or if it is unable to alter its products, processes or sources of supply to avoid use of such materials. ChargePoint may also encounter end-customers who require that all of the\ncomponents of the products be certified as conflict free. If ChargePoint is not able to meet this requirement, such end-customers may choose to purchase products from a different company.\nChargePoint\u2019s business is subject to risks associated with construction, cost overruns and delays, and other contingencies that may arise in the course of completing installations, and such risks may increase in the future as ChargePoint expands the scope of such services with other parties.\nChargePoint does not typically install charging stations at customer sites. These installations are typically performed by ChargePoint partners or electrical contractors with an existing relationship with the customer and/or knowledge of the site. The installation of charging stations at a particular site is generally subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with state and local laws and ordinances relating to building codes, safety, environmental protection and related matters, and typically requires various local and other governmental approvals and permits that may vary by jurisdiction. In addition, building codes, accessibility requirements or regulations may hinder EV charger installation because they end up costing the developer or installer more in order to meet the code requirements. Meaningful delays or cost overruns may impact ChargePoint\u2019s recognition of revenue in certain cases and/or impact customer relationships, either of which could impact ChargePoint\u2019s business and profitability.\nFurthermore, ChargePoint may in the future elect to install charging stations at customer sites or manage contractors, likely as part of offering customers a turnkey solution. Working with contractors may require ChargePoint to obtain licenses or require it or its customers to comply with additional rules, working conditions and other union requirements, which can add costs and complexity to an installation project. In addition, if these contractors are unable to provide timely, thorough and quality installation-related services, customers could fall behind their construction schedules leading to liability to ChargePoint or cause customers to become dissatisfied with the solutions ChargePoint offers and ChargePoint\u2019s overall reputation would be harmed.\nAcquisitions or strategic investments could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of key management personnel, disrupt ChargePoint\u2019s business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nAs part of ChargePoint\u2019s business strategy, ChargePoint has made and continues to consider making acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, services or technologies that are complementary to its existing business. For example, on August 11, 2021, ChargePoint acquired ViriCiti, a provider of electrification solutions for eBus and commercial fleets, and on October 6, 2021, ChargePoint acquired has\u2022to\u2022be, an e-mobility and charging software platform. The process of identifying and consummating acquisitions, investments and the subsequent integration of new assets and businesses into ChargePoint\u2019s own business, requires attention from management and could result in a diversion of resources from its existing business, which in turn could have an adverse effect on its operations. Acquired assets or businesses may not generate the expected financial results. Acquisitions or investments could also result in the use of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the occurrence of goodwill impairment charges, amortization expenses for other intangible assets and exposure to potential unknown liabilities of the acquired business or investment. ChargePoint may also incur costs and management time on transactions that are ultimately not completed. In addition, ChargePoint\u2019s due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product, technology or investment, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or issues with employees or customers.\nChargePoint\u2019s acquisitions or investments may not ultimately strengthen its competitive position or achieve its goals and business strategy; ChargePoint may be subject to claims or liabilities assumed from an acquired company, product or technology; acquisitions or investments ChargePoint completes could be viewed negatively by its customers, investors and securities analysts; and ChargePoint may incur costs and expenses necessary to address an acquired company\u2019s failure to comply with laws and governmental rules and regulations. Additionally, ChargePoint may be subject to litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, former stockholders or other third parties, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks ChargePoint\u2019s business faces. An acquired company may also need to implement or improve its controls, procedures and policies, and ChargePoint may face risks associated if any of those controls, procedures or policies are insufficiently effective. ChargePoint may also face retention or cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into its organization. If ChargePoint is unsuccessful at integrating acquisitions or investments, in a timely manner, the revenue and operating results of the combined company could be adversely affected. Any integration process may require significant time and resources, which may disrupt ChargePoint\u2019s ongoing business and divert management\u2019s attention, and ChargePoint may not be able to manage the integration process successfully or in a timely manner. ChargePoint may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel, realize anticipated synergies from the acquisition or investment, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or investment transaction or the related integration of such acquisition or investment, including accounting charges and any potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets recognized in connection with such transaction. ChargePoint may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity or equity-linked securities to pay for any acquisitions or investments, each of which could adversely affect its financial condition or the market price of its Common Stock. Furthermore, the sale of equity or issuance of equity-linked debt to finance any such transaction could result in dilution to ChargePoint\u2019s stockholders. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm ChargePoint\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf ChargePoint is unable to attract and retain key employees and hire qualified management, technical, engineering and sales personnel, its ability to compete and successfully grow its business would be harmed.\nChargePoint\u2019s success depends, in part, on its continuing ability to identify, hire, attract, train and develop and retain highly qualified personnel. The inability to do so effectively would adversely affect its business. ChargePoint\u2019s future performance also depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of its senior management to execute on its business plan and to identify and\npursue new opportunities and product innovations. The loss of services of senior management, or the ineffective management of any leadership transitions, especially within ChargePoint\u2019s sales organization, could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of its development and strategic objectives, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and operating results.\nCompetition for employees can be intense, particularly in Silicon Valley where ChargePoint is headquartered, and the ability to attract, hire and retain them depends on ChargePoint\u2019s ability to provide competitive compensation. In addition, job market dynamics have been impacted by the \u201cgreat resignation,\u201d with a significant number of people leaving the workforce, and future challenges related to ChargePoint\u2019s \u201creturn-to-office\u201d plans, hybrid work model or workplace practices could lead to attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees. ChargePoint may not be able to attract, assimilate, develop or retain qualified personnel in the future, and failure to do so could adversely affect its business, including the execution of its global business strategy.\nChargePoint is expanding operations internationally, particularly in Europe, which will expose it to additional tax, compliance, market and other risks.\nChargePoint\u2019s primary operations are in the United States and it maintains contractual relationships with parts and manufacturing suppliers in Asia, Mexico and other locations. Also, ChargePoint is continuing to invest to increase its presence in Europe, including its acquisitions of ViriCiti and has\u2022to\u2022be, and to expand primarily research and development teams in Gurgaon, India, Reading, England and Radstadt, Austria. Managing these expansions requires additional resources and controls, and could subject ChargePoint to risks associated with international operations, including:\n\u2022cost of alternative power sources, which could vary meaningfully outside the United States;\n\u2022conformity with applicable business customs, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u2022lack of availability of government incentives and subsidies;\n\u2022challenges in arranging, and availability of, financing for customers;\n\u2022potential changes to its established business model;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations in an environment of diverse culture, laws, and customers, and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal and compliance costs associated with international operations;\n\u2022installation challenges;\n\u2022differing driving habits and transportation modalities in other markets;\n\u2022different levels of demand among commercial, fleet and residential customers;\n\u2022compliance with multiple, potentially conflicting and changing governmental laws, regulations, certifications, and permitting processes including environmental, banking, employment, tax, information security, privacy, and data protection laws and regulations such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) and newer state privacy laws in the United States including in Virginia and Colorado, the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d) General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), national legislation implementing the same and changing requirements for legally transferring data out of the European Economic Area;\n\u2022compliance with U.S. and foreign anti-bribery laws including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act of 2020 (the \u201cAnti-Bribery Act\u201d);\n\u2022conforming products to various international regulatory and safety requirements as well as charging and other electric infrastructures;\n\u2022difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022difficulties in collecting payments in foreign currencies and associated foreign currency exposure;\n\u2022restrictions on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022compliance with potentially conflicting and changing laws of taxing jurisdictions and compliance with applicable U.S. tax laws as they relate to international operations, the complexity and adverse consequences of such tax laws, and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in such tax laws; and\n\u2022regional economic and political conditions, including the outbreak of war or other hostilities.\nAs a result of these risks, ChargePoint\u2019s current expansion efforts and any potential future international expansion efforts may not be successful.\nSome members of ChargePoint\u2019s management have limited experience in operating a public company.\nSome of ChargePoint\u2019s executive officers have limited experience in the management of a publicly-traded company. The management team may not successfully or effectively continue the management of a public company that is subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under federal securities laws, particularly in light of the SEC\u2019s increasing focus on former shell companies.\nTheir limited experience in dealing with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies could be a significant disadvantage in that it is likely that an increasing amount of their time may be devoted to these activities, which will result in less time being devoted to the management and growth of ChargePoint. ChargePoint may not have adequate personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in the accounting policies, practices or internal control over financial reporting required of public companies. The development and implementation of the standards and controls and the hiring of experienced personnel necessary to achieve the level of accounting standards required of a public company may require costs greater than expected.\nChargePoint\u2019s future revenue growth will depend in significant part on its ability to increase sales of its products and services to fleet operators.\nChargePoint\u2019s future revenue growth will depend in significant part on its ability to increase sales of its products and services to fleet operators. The electrification of fleets is an emerging market, and fleet operators may not adopt EVs on a widespread basis and on the timelines ChargePoint anticipates. In addition to the factors affecting the growth of the EV market generally, transitioning to an EV fleet can be costly and capital intensive, which could result in slower than anticipated adoption. The sales cycle could also be longer for sales to fleet operators, as they are often larger organizations, with more formal procurement processes than smaller commercial site hosts. Fleet operators may also require significant additional services and support, and if ChargePoint is unable to provide such services and support, it may adversely affect its ability to attract additional fleet operators as customers. Any failure to attract and retain fleet operators as customers in the future would adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s business and results of operations.\nChargePoint is highly reliant on its networked charging solution and information technology systems and data, and those of its service providers which may be subject to cyber-attacks, service disruptions or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, loss or interruption of services, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences.\nChargePoint continues to expand its information technology systems in the form of its networked charging solution, and as its operations grow its internal information technology systems, such as product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems. This includes the implementation of new internally developed systems and the deployment of such systems in the United States and abroad. While ChargePoint maintains information technology measures designed to protect it against intellectual property theft, data breaches, sabotage and other external or internal cyber-attacks or misappropriation, its systems and those of its service providers are potentially vulnerable to malware, ransomware, viruses, denial-of-service attacks, phishing attacks, social engineering, computer hacking, unauthorized access, exploitation of bugs, defects and vulnerabilities, breakdowns, damage, interruptions, system malfunctions, power outages, terrorism, acts of vandalism, security breaches, security incidents, inadvertent or intentional actions by employees or other third parties, and other cyber-attacks. To the extent any security incident results in unauthorized access or damage to or acquisition, use, corruption, loss, destruction, alteration or dissemination of ChargePoint data, including intellectual property and personal information, or ChargePoint products, or for it to be believed or reported that any of these occurred, it could disrupt ChargePoint\u2019s business, harm its reputation, compel it to comply with applicable data breach notification laws, subject it to time consuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require it to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject it to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This could result in increased costs to ChargePoint and result in significant legal and financial exposure and/or reputational harm.\nBecause ChargePoint also relies on third-party service providers, it cannot guarantee that its service providers\u2019 and component suppliers\u2019 systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in a security incident, or other disruption to, ChargePoint\u2019s or ChargePoint\u2019s service providers\u2019 or component suppliers\u2019 systems. ChargePoint\u2019s ability to monitor its service providers\u2019 and component suppliers\u2019 security measures is limited, and, in any event, malicious third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures. Further, the implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management time, support and cost, and there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding ChargePoint\u2019s core systems as well as implementing new systems and updating current systems, including disruptions to the related areas of business operation. These risks may affect ChargePoint\u2019s ability to manage its data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service products, adequately protect its intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits under, tax laws and other applicable regulations.\nIf ChargePoint does not successfully implement, maintain or expand its information technology systems as planned, its operations may be disrupted, its ability to accurately and/or timely report its financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may\narise in its internal control over financial reporting, which may impact its ability to certify its financial results (see also \u201cRisks Related to Legal Matters and Regulations-ChargePoint may face litigation and other risks as a result of the material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting and the restatement of its financial statements,\u201d and \u201cFinancial, Tax and Accounting-Related Risks -ChargePoint has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. If ChargePoint is unable to remediate these material weaknesses, or if ChargePoint identifies additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fails to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, this may result in material misstatements of ChargePoint\u2019s consolidated financial statements or cause ChargePoint to fail to meet its periodic reporting obligations,\u201d for more detail). Moreover, ChargePoint\u2019s proprietary information, including intellectual property and personal information, could be compromised or misappropriated and its reputation may be adversely affected if these systems or their functionality do not operate as expected and ChargePoint may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions.\nComputer malware, viruses, ransomware, hacking, phishing attacks and similar disruptions could result in security and privacy breaches and interruption in service, which could harm ChargePoint\u2019s business.\nComputer malware, viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions could lead to interruption and delays in ChargePoint\u2019s services and operations and loss, misuse or theft of data. Computer malware, viruses, ransomware, hacking and phishing attacks against online networks have become more prevalent and may occur on ChargePoint\u2019s systems in the future. Cyber security organizations in many countries have published warnings of increased cybersecurity threats to U.S. businesses, and external events, like the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may increase the likelihood of cybersecurity attacks, particularly directed at energy, fueling or infrastructure service providers. Any attempts by cyber attackers to disrupt ChargePoint\u2019s services or systems, if successful, could harm its business, introduce liability to data subjects, result in the misappropriation of funds, be expensive to remedy, subject ChargePoint to substantial fines, penalties, damages and other liabilities under applicable laws and regulations, lead to a loss of protection of its intellectual property or trade secrets and damage its reputation or brand. Insurance may not be sufficient to cover significant expenses and losses related to cyber-attacks. Efforts to prevent cyber attackers from entering computer systems are expensive to implement, and ChargePoint may not be able to cause the implementation or enforcement of such preventions with respect to its third-party vendors. Though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of systems and technical infrastructure may, in addition to other losses, harm ChargePoint\u2019s reputation, brand and ability to attract customers.\nChargePoint has previously experienced, and may in the future experience, service disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, third-party service providers, component supplier and manufacturer disruptions, human or software errors and capacity constraints. If ChargePoint\u2019s services are unavailable when users attempt to access them, they may seek other services, which could reduce demand for its solutions from target customers.\nChargePoint has processes and procedures in place designed to enable it to quickly recover from a disaster or catastrophe and continue business operations and has tested this capability under controlled circumstances. However, there are several factors ranging from human error to data corruption that could materially impact the efficacy of such processes and procedures, including by lengthening the time services are partially or fully unavailable to customers and users. It may be difficult or impossible to perform some or all recovery steps and continue normal business operations due to the nature of a particular disaster or catastrophe, especially during peak periods, which could cause additional reputational damages, or loss of revenue, any of which could adversely affect its business and financial results.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in ChargePoint\u2019s revenue.\nChargePoint believes there are seasonal factors that may cause ChargePoint to record higher revenue in some quarters compared with others. A significant share of ChargePoint\u2019s annual revenues are typically generated in the fourth fiscal quarter, which coincides with customers with a December 31 year-end choosing to spend remaining unused portions of their budgets. ChargePoint\u2019s revenues are typically lower in its fiscal first quarter than its preceding fourth quarter, due to unfavorable weather conditions which result in a decrease in construction activity during the winter months, periods of wet weather and times when other weather and climate conditions would impair construction activity. While ChargePoint believes it has visibility into the seasonality of its business, various factors, including difficult weather conditions (such as flooding, hurricanes, prolonged rain or periods of unseasonably cold or snowstorms) in any quarter, may materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChargePoint\u2019s headquarters and other facilities are located in an active earthquake zone; an earthquake or other types of natural disasters or resource shortages, including public safety power shut-offs that have occurred and may continue to occur in California, could disrupt and harm its operations and those of ChargePoint\u2019s customers.\nChargePoint conducts a majority of its operations in the San Francisco Bay area in an active earthquake zone. The occurrence of a natural disaster such as an earthquake, drought, flood, fire (such as the recent extensive wildfires in California), localized extended outages of critical utilities (such as California\u2019s public safety power shut-offs) or transportation systems, or any critical resource shortages could cause a significant interruption in its business, damage or destroy its facilities or inventories, and cause it to incur\nsignificant costs, any of which could harm its business, financial condition and results of operations. The insurance ChargePoint maintains against fires, earthquakes and other natural disasters may not be adequate to cover losses in any particular case.\nIn addition, rolling public safety power shut offs in California or other states can affect user acceptance of EVs, as charging may be unavailable at the desired times, or at all during these events. These shut offs could also affect the ability of fleet operators to charge their EVs, which, for example, could adversely affect transportation schedules or any service level agreements to which either ChargePoint or the fleet operator may be a party. If these events persist, the demand for EVs could decline, which would result in reduced demand for charging solutions.\nRisks Related to the EV Market\nChargePoint\u2019s future growth and success is highly correlated with and thus dependent upon the continuing rapid adoption of EVs for passenger and fleet applications.\nChargePoint\u2019s future growth is highly dependent upon the adoption of EVs by businesses and consumers. The market for EVs is still rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, competitive pricing and competitive factors, evolving government regulation and industry standards and changing consumer demands and behaviors, changing levels of concern related to environmental issues and governmental initiatives related to energy independence, climate change and the environment generally. Although demand for EVs has grown in recent years, there is no guarantee of continuing future demand. If the market for EVs develops more slowly than expected, or if demand for EVs decreases, ChargePoint\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be harmed. The market for EVs could be affected by numerous factors, such as:\n\u2022perceptions about EV features, quality, safety, performance and cost;\n\u2022perceptions about the limited range over which EVs may be driven on a single battery charge;\n\u2022competition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high fuel-economy internal combustion engine vehicles;\n\u2022volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline, including as a result of trade restrictions;\n\u2022concerns regarding the stability of the electrical grid;\n\u2022the decline of an EV battery\u2019s ability to hold a charge over time;\n\u2022availability of service for EVs;\n\u2022consumers\u2019 perception about the convenience and cost of charging EVs;\n\u2022increases in fuel efficiency;\n\u2022government regulations and economic incentives, including adverse changes in, or expiration of, favorable tax incentives related to EVs, EV charging stations or decarbonization generally;\n\u2022relaxation of government mandates or quotas regarding the sale of EVs; and\n\u2022concerns about the future viability of EV manufacturers.\nIn addition, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry can be cyclical, which may affect growth in acceptance of EVs. It is uncertain how macroeconomic factors will impact demand for EVs, particularly since they can be more expensive than traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, when the automotive industry globally has been experiencing a recent decline in sales. Furthermore, because fleet operators often make large purchases of EVs, this cyclicality and volatility in the automotive industry may be more pronounced with commercial purchasers, and any significant decline in demand from these customers could reduce demand for EV charging and ChargePoint\u2019s products and services in particular.\nDemand for EVs may also be affected by factors directly impacting automobile prices or the cost of purchasing and operating automobiles, such as sales and financing incentives, prices of raw materials and parts and components, cost of fuel and governmental regulations, including tariffs, import regulation and other taxes. Further, the automotive industry in general and EV manufacturing have experienced substantial supply chain interruption due to COVID-19 and a worldwide semiconductor shortage adversely impacting the automotive industry in 2020 and 2021, resulting in reduced EV production schedules and sales. Volatility in demand or delays in EV production due to global supply chain constraints may lead to lower vehicle unit sales, which may result in reduced demand for EV charging solutions and therefore adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe EV market currently benefits from the availability of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives from governments, utilities and others to offset the purchase or operating cost of EVs and EV charging stations. In particular, ChargePoint\u2019s marketing efforts have heavily relied upon federal tax credits available to purchasers of its EV charging stations that effectively provide purchasers with a significantly discounted purchase price. The reduction, modification, or elimination of such benefits could cause reduced demand for EVs and EV charging stations, which would adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s financial results.\nThe U.S. federal government, foreign governments and some state and local governments provide incentives to end users and purchasers of EVs and EV charging stations in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives, such as payments for regulatory credits. The EV market relies on these governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives to significantly lower the effective price of EVs and EV charging stations to customers. For example, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed into law on November 15, 2021 would provide additional funding for EVs and EV charging infrastructure through the creation of new programs and grants and the expansion of existing programs, including $7.5 billion for EV charging along highway corridors. However, these incentives may expire on a particular date, end when the allocated funding is exhausted, or be reduced or terminated as a matter of regulatory or legislative policy. In particular, ChargePoint has benefited from the availability of federal tax credits to purchasers under Section 30C of the Code to market its EV charging stations, which can effectively provide such purchasers with up to a 30% discount off the purchase price of ChargePoint\u2019s EV charging stations.The credits under Section 30C of the Code were allowed to expire by Congress on December 31, 2021, and there can be no assurance that the credits under Section 30C of the Code will be extended or made retroactively effective under any other clean energy bill or incentive. Any other reduction in rebates, tax credits or other financial incentives for EV charging stations could materially reduce the demand for EVs and ChargePoint\u2019s solutions and, as a result, may adversely impact ChargePoint\u2019s business and expansion potential.\nChargePoint also derives other revenue from regulatory credits. If government support of these credits declines, ChargePoint\u2019s ability to generate this other revenue in the future would be adversely affected. In years prior to fiscal year 2021, ChargePoint has derived a slight majority of its other revenue from regulatory credits. However, revenue from this source as a percentage of other and total revenue has declined in recent quarters and it may continue to decline over time. Further, the availability of such credits may decline even with general governmental support of the transition to EV infrastructure. For example, in September 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom issued Executive Order N-79-20 (the \u201cEO\u201d), announcing a target for all in-state sales of new passenger cars and trucks to be zero-emission by 2035. While the EO calls for the support of EV infrastructure, the form of this support is unclear. If California or other jurisdictions choose to adopt regulatory mandates instead of establishing or continuing green energy credit regimes for EV infrastructure, ChargePoint\u2019s revenue from these credits would be adversely impacted.\nChanges to fuel economy standards or the success of alternative fuels may negatively impact the EV market and thus the demand for ChargePoint\u2019s products and services.\nAs regulatory initiatives have required an increase in the mileage capabilities of cars, consumption of renewable transportation fuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, and consumer acceptance of EVs and other alternative vehicles has been increasing. If fuel efficiency of non-electric vehicles continues to rise, whether as the result of regulations or otherwise, and affordability of vehicles using renewable transportation fuels improves, the demand for electric and high energy vehicles could diminish. In addition, the EV fueling model is different than gas or other fuel models, requiring behavior change and education of influencers, consumers and others such as regulatory bodies. Developments in alternative technologies, such as advanced diesel, ethanol, fuel cells or compressed natural gas, or improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine, may materially and adversely affect demand for EVs and EV charging stations. For example, fuel which is abundant and relatively inexpensive in the United States, such as compressed natural gas, may emerge as a preferred alternative to petroleum-based propulsion. Regulatory bodies may also adopt rules that substantially favor certain alternatives to petroleum-based propulsion over others, which may not necessarily be EVs, or may adopt rules to eliminate, modify or reduce penalties or incentives to maintain minimum fuel economy standards. Any of these changes may impose additional obstacles to the purchase of EVs or the development of a more ubiquitous EV market. If any of the above cause or contribute to consumers or businesses to no longer purchase EVs or purchase them at a lower rate, it would materially and adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nThe EV charging market is characterized by rapid technological changes often due to technical improvements, regulatory requirements and customer requirements, which requires ChargePoint to continue to develop new products and product innovations. Any delays in such development could adversely affect market adoption of its products and ChargePoint\u2019s financial results.\nContinuing technological changes in battery and other EV technologies could adversely affect adoption of current EV charging technology and/or ChargePoint\u2019s products. ChargePoint\u2019s future success will depend upon its ability to develop and introduce a variety of new capabilities and innovations to its existing product offerings, as well as introduce a variety of new product offerings, to address the changing needs of the EV charging market. As new products are introduced, gross margins tend to decline in the near term and improve as the product becomes more mature with a more efficient manufacturing process.\nAs EV technologies change or governmental regulations impose new requirements on EV charging technology, ChargePoint may need to upgrade or adapt its charging station technology and introduce new products and services in order to serve vehicles that have the latest technology, in particular battery cell technology, or comply with new governmental regulations, which could involve substantial costs. Even if ChargePoint is able to keep pace with changes in technology and develop new products and services, its research and development expenses could increase, its gross margins could be adversely affected in some periods and its prior products could become obsolete or non-compliant with governmental regulations more quickly than expected. ChargePoint cannot guarantee that any new\nproducts will be released in a timely manner, or at all, or achieve market acceptance. Delays in delivering new products that meet customer requirements could damage ChargePoint\u2019s relationships with customers and lead them to seek alternative providers. Delays in introducing products and innovations or the failure to offer innovative products or services at competitive prices may cause existing and potential customers to purchase ChargePoint\u2019s competitors\u2019 products or services. Finally, new or changing state or federal regulations may result in delays related to the development of new products or modifications to existing products in order to come into compliance and any such delays may result in customer\u2019s selecting alternative providers or result in delays related to ChargePoint\u2019s ability to install, sell or distribute its charging station technology.\nIf ChargePoint is unable to devote adequate resources to develop products or cannot otherwise successfully develop products or services that meet customer and regulatory requirements on a timely basis or that remain competitive with technological alternatives, its products and services could lose market share, its revenue may decline, it may experience higher operating losses and its business and prospects may be adversely affected.\nCertain statements ChargePoint makes about estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate.\nFrom time to time, ChargePoint makes statements with estimates of the addressable market for ChargePoint\u2019s solutions and the EV market in general. Market opportunity estimates and growth forecasts, whether obtained from third-party sources or developed internally, are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate. This is especially so at the present time due to the uncertain and rapidly changing projections of the severity, magnitude and duration of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, worldwide supply chain disruptions and market and geopolitical volatility. The estimates and forecasts relating to the size and expected growth of the target EV market, market demand and adoption, capacity to address this demand and pricing may also prove to be inaccurate. In particular, estimates regarding the current and projected EV market opportunity are difficult to predict. The estimated addressable EV market may not materialize for many years, if ever, and even if the markets meet the size estimates and growth forecasts, ChargePoint\u2019s business could fail to grow at similar rates.\nRisks Related to ChargePoint\u2019s Technology, Intellectual Property and Infrastructure\nChargePoint expects to incur research and development costs and devote significant resources to developing new products, which could significantly reduce its profitability and may never result in revenue to ChargePoint.\nChargePoint\u2019s future growth depends on penetrating new markets, adapting existing products to new applications and customer requirements, and introducing new products that achieve market acceptance. ChargePoint plans to incur significant research and development costs in the future as part of its efforts to design, develop, manufacture and introduce new products and enhance existing products. ChargePoint\u2019s research and development expenses were $145.0 million, $75.0 million, and $69.5 million during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are likely to grow in the future. Further, ChargePoint\u2019s research and development program may not produce successful results, and its new products may not achieve market acceptance, create additional revenue or become profitable.\nChargePoint may need to defend against intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims, which may be time-consuming and expensive.\nFrom time to time, the holders of intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge ChargePoint to take licenses, and/or may bring suits alleging infringement, misappropriation or other violation of such rights. There can be no assurance that ChargePoint will be able to mitigate the risk of potential suits or other legal demands by competitors or other third-parties. Accordingly, ChargePoint may consider entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur, and such licenses and associated litigation could significantly increase ChargePoint\u2019s operating expenses. In addition, if ChargePoint is determined to have or believes there is a high likelihood that it has infringed upon, misappropriated or otherwise violated a third-party\u2019s intellectual property rights, it may be required to cease making, selling or incorporating certain key components or intellectual property into the products and services it offers, to pay substantial damages and/or royalties, to redesign its products and services, and/or to establish and maintain alternative branding. In addition, to the extent that ChargePoint\u2019s customers and business partners become the subject of any allegation or claim regarding the infringement, misappropriation or other violation of intellectual property rights related to ChargePoint\u2019s products and services, ChargePoint may be required to indemnify such customers and business partners. If ChargePoint were required to take one or more such actions, its business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs, negative publicity and diversion of resources and management attention.\nChargePoint\u2019s business may be adversely affected if it is unable to protect its technology and intellectual property from unauthorized use by third parties.\nChargePoint\u2019s success depends, at least in part, on ChargePoint\u2019s ability to obtain, maintain, enforce and protect its core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, ChargePoint relies on, and plans to continue relying on, a combination of patents, trade secrets (including know-how), employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, copyright, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to retain ownership of, and protect, its technology. Despite ChargePoint\u2019s efforts to obtain, maintain, enforce and protect intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that these steps will be available in all cases or will\nbe adequate to prevent ChargePoint\u2019s competitors or other third-parties from copying, reverse engineering, or otherwise obtaining and using its technology or products or seeking court declarations that they do not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate its intellectual property. Failure to adequately protect its technology and intellectual property could result in competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of ChargePoint\u2019s competitive advantage and a decrease in revenue which would adversely affect its business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nThe measures ChargePoint takes to protect its technology intellectual property from unauthorized use by others may not be effective for various reasons, including the following:\n\u2022any patent applications ChargePoint submits may not result in the issuance of patents;\n\u2022the scope of issued patents may not be broad enough to protect its inventions and proprietary rights;\n\u2022any issued patents may be challenged by competitors and/or invalidated by courts or governmental authorities;\n\u2022ChargePoint may not be the first inventor of the subject matter to which it has filed a particular patent application, and it may not be the first party to file such a patent application;\n\u2022Patents have a finite term, and competitors and other third-parties may offer identical or similar products after the expiration of ChargePoint\u2019s patents that cover such products;\n\u2022the costs associated with enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements or other intellectual property rights may make aggressive enforcement impracticable;\n\u2022current and future competitors may circumvent patents or independently develop similar trade secrets or works of authorship, such as software;\n\u2022know-how and other proprietary information ChargePoint purports to hold as a trade secret may not qualify as a trade secret under applicable laws;\n\u2022ChargePoint\u2019s employees, contractors or business partners may breach their confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-use obligations; and\n\u2022proprietary designs and technology embodied in ChargePoint\u2019s products may be discoverable by third-parties through means that do not constitute violations of applicable laws.\nPatent, trademark, and trade secret laws vary significantly throughout the world. Some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Further, policing the unauthorized use of its intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions may be difficult or impossible. Therefore, ChargePoint\u2019s intellectual property rights may not be as strong or as easily enforced outside of the United States.\nCertain patents in the EV space may come to be considered \u201cstandards essential.\u201d If this is the case with respect to any of ChargePoint\u2019s patents, it may be required to license certain technology on \u201cfair, reasonable and non-discriminatory\u201d terms, decreasing revenue. Further, competitors, vendors, or customers may, in certain instances, be free to create variations or derivative works of ChargePoint technology and intellectual property, and those derivative works may become directly competitive with ChargePoint\u2019s offerings. Finally, ChargePoint may not be able to leverage, or obtain ownership of, all technology and intellectual property developed by ChargePoint\u2019s vendors in connection with design and manufacture of ChargePoint\u2019s products, thereby jeopardizing ChargePoint\u2019s ability to obtain a competitive advantage over its competitors.\nIt is ChargePoint\u2019s policy to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with its employees and contractors that have developed material intellectual property for ChargePoint, but these agreements may not be self-executing and may not otherwise adequately protect ChargePoint\u2019s intellectual property, particularly with respect to conflicts of ownership relating to work product generated by employees and contractors. Furthermore, ChargePoint cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, and that third-parties will not gain access to its trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary technology. Third-parties may also independently develop the same or substantially similar proprietary technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of ChargePoint\u2019s intellectual property is difficult and costly, as are the steps ChargePoint has taken or will take to prevent misappropriation.\nTo prevent unauthorized use of ChargePoint\u2019s intellectual property, it may be necessary to prosecute actions for infringement, misappropriation or other violation of ChargePoint\u2019s intellectual property against third-parties. Any such action could result in significant costs and diversion of ChargePoint\u2019s resources and management\u2019s attention, and there can be no assurance that ChargePoint will be successful in any such action. Furthermore, many of ChargePoint\u2019s current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights than ChargePoint does. Accordingly, despite its efforts, ChargePoint may not be able to prevent third-parties from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating its intellectual property. Any of the foregoing may adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s revenues or results of operations.\nThe current lack of international standards may lead to uncertainty, additional competition and further unexpected costs.\nLack of industry standards for EV station management, coupled with utilities and other large organizations mandating their own adoption of specifications that have not become widely adopted in the industry, may hinder innovation or slow new product or new feature introduction.\nIn addition, automobile manufacturers may choose to utilize their own proprietary systems, which could lock out competition for EV charging stations, or to use their size and market position to influence the market, which could limit ChargePoint\u2019s market and reach to customers, negatively impacting its business.\nFurther, should regulatory bodies later impose a standard that is not compatible with ChargePoint\u2019s infrastructure, it may incur significant costs to adapt its business model to the new regulatory standard, which may require significant time and, as a result, may have a material and adverse effect on its revenue or results of operations.\nChargePoint\u2019s technology could have undetected defects, errors or bugs in hardware or software which could reduce market adoption, damage its reputation with current or prospective customers, and/or expose it to product liability and other claims that could materially and adversely affect its business.\nChargePoint may be subject to claims that charging stations have malfunctioned and persons were injured or purported to be injured. Any insurance that ChargePoint carries may not be sufficient or it may not apply to all situations. Similarly, to the extent that such malfunctions are related to components obtained from third-party vendors, such vendors may not assume responsibility for such malfunctions. In addition, ChargePoint\u2019s customers could be subjected to claims as a result of such incidents and may bring legal claims against ChargePoint to attempt to hold it liable. Any of these events could adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s brand, relationships with customers, operating results or financial condition.\nAcross ChargePoint\u2019s product line, ChargePoint develops equipment solutions based on preferred second source or common off-the-shelf vendors. However, due to its designs, ChargePoint does rely on some single source vendors, the unavailability or failure of which can pose risks to supply chain or product shipping situations.\nFurthermore, ChargePoint\u2019s software platform is complex, developed for over a decade by many developers, and includes a number of licensed third-party commercial and open-source software libraries. ChargePoint\u2019s software has contained defects and errors and may in the future contain undetected defects or errors. ChargePoint is continuing to evolve the features and functionality of its platform through updates and enhancements, and as it does, it may introduce additional defects or errors that may not be detected until after deployment to customers. In addition, if ChargePoint\u2019s products and services, including any updates or patches, are not implemented or used correctly or as intended, inadequate performance and disruptions in service may result.\nAny defects or errors in product or services offerings, or the perception of such defects or errors, or other performance problems could result in any of the following, each of which could adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s business and results of its operations:\n\u2022expenditure of significant financial and product development resources, including recalls, in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate or work around errors or defects;\n\u2022loss of existing or potential customers or partners;\n\u2022interruptions or delays in sales;\n\u2022delayed or lost revenue;\n\u2022delay or failure to attain market acceptance;\n\u2022delay in the development or release of new functionality or improvements;\n\u2022negative publicity and reputational harm;\n\u2022sales credits or refunds;\n\u2022exposure of confidential or proprietary information;\n\u2022diversion of development and customer service resources;\n\u2022breach of warranty claims;\n\u2022legal claims under applicable laws, rules and regulations; and\n\u2022an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation.\nAlthough ChargePoint has contractual protections, such as warranty disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions, in many of its agreements with customers, resellers and other business partners, such protections may not be uniformly implemented in all contracts and, where implemented, may not fully or effectively protect from claims by customers, resellers, business partners or other third-parties. Any insurance coverage or indemnification obligations of suppliers may not adequately cover all such claims or cover only a portion of such claims. A successful product liability, warranty, or other similar claim could have an adverse effect on ChargePoint\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in expenditure of funds in litigation, divert management\u2019s time and other resources and cause reputational harm.\nSome of ChargePoint\u2019s products contain open-source software, which may pose particular risks to its proprietary software, products and services in a manner that could harm its business.\nChargePoint uses open-source software in its products and anticipates using open-source software in the future. Some open-source software licenses require those who distribute open-source software as part of their own software product to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software product or to make available any derivative works of the open-source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost, and ChargePoint may be subject to such terms. The terms of many open-source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on ChargePoint\u2019s ability to provide or distribute ChargePoint\u2019s products or services.\nIn addition, ChargePoint relies on some open-source software and libraries issued under the General Public License (or similar \u201ccopyleft\u201d licenses) for development of its products and may continue to rely on similar copyleft licenses. Third-parties may assert a copyright claim against ChargePoint regarding its use of such software or libraries, which could lead to a limitation of ChargePoint\u2019s use of such software or libraries. Use of such software or libraries may also force ChargePoint to provide third-parties, at no cost, the source code to its proprietary software, which may decrease revenue and lessen any competitive advantage ChargePoint has due to the secrecy of its source code.\nChargePoint could face claims from third-parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the open-source software or derivative works that ChargePoint developed using such software, which could include ChargePoint\u2019s proprietary source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open-source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require ChargePoint to make its software source code freely available, purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated products or services unless and until ChargePoint can re-engineer them to avoid infringement, which may be a costly and time-consuming process, and ChargePoint may not be able to complete the re-engineering process successfully.\nAdditionally, the use of certain open-source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software. There is typically no support available for open-source software, and ChargePoint cannot ensure that the authors of such open-source software will implement or push updates to address security risks or will not abandon further development and maintenance. Many of the risks associated with the use of open-source software, such as the lack of warranties or assurances of title or performance, cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, have an adverse effect on ChargePoint\u2019s business and results.\nInterruptions, delays in service or inability to increase capacity, including internationally, at third-party data center facilities could impair the use or functionality of ChargePoint\u2019s subscription services, harm its business and subject it to liability.\nChargePoint currently serves customers from third-party data center facilities operated by Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) located in the United States, Europe and Canada. In addition to AWS, some ChargePoint services are housed in third-party data centers operated by Rackspace Technology in the United States. Any outage or failure of such data centers could negatively affect ChargePoint\u2019s product connectivity and performance. ChargePoint\u2019s primary environments are behind the Content Delivery Network operated by Cloudflare, Inc. (\u201cCloudflare\u201d), and any interruptions of Cloudflare\u2019s services could negatively affect ChargePoint\u2019s product connectivity and performance. Furthermore, ChargePoint depends on connectivity from its charging stations to its data centers through cellular service providers, such as Verizon. Any incident affecting a data center facility\u2019s or a cellular service provider\u2019s infrastructure or operations, whether caused by fire, flood, severe storm, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failures, breach of security protocols, computer viruses and disabling devices, failure of access control mechanisms, natural disasters, war, criminal act, military actions, terrorist attacks and other similar events could negatively affect the use, functionality or availability of ChargePoint\u2019s services.\nAny damage to, or failure of, ChargePoint\u2019s systems, or those of its third-party providers, could interrupt or hinder the use or functionality of its services. Impairment of or interruptions in ChargePoint\u2019s services may reduce revenue, subject it to claims and litigation, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions, and adversely affect renewal rates and its ability to attract new customers. ChargePoint\u2019s business will also be harmed if customers and potential customers believe its products and services are unreliable.\nCustomer-Related Risks\nChargePoint may be unable to leverage customer data in all geographic locations, and this limitation may impact research and development operations.\nChargePoint relies on data collected through charging stations or its mobile application, including usage data and geolocation data. ChargePoint uses this data in connection with the research, development and analysis of its technologies. ChargePoint\u2019s inability to obtain necessary rights to use this data or freely transfer this data out of, for example, the European Economic Area, could result in delays or otherwise negatively impact ChargePoint\u2019s research and development efforts.\nChargePoint\u2019s ability to maintain customer satisfaction depends in part on the quality of ChargePoint\u2019s customer support. Failure to maintain high-quality customer support could adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s reputation, business, results of operation, and financial condition.\nChargePoint believes that the successful use of its EV charging stations and Cloud Services requires a high level of support and engagement for many of its customers, particularly its fleet and commercial customers. In order to deliver appropriate customer support and engagement, ChargePoint must successfully assist its customers in deploying and continuing to use ChargePoint\u2019s Cloud Services tools and EV charging stations, resolving performance issues, addressing interoperability challenges with a customers\u2019 existing information technology or fuel management platforms, responding to EV charging station component failures or replacement parts, as well as charging station performance and reliability issues that may arise from time to time.\nChargePoint provides support to its commercial, fleet and residential EV charging station owners and operators. Such support services are generally provided under its Assure warranty program, including proactive charging station monitoring, guaranteed service response times and labor and parts warranties. ChargePoint further provides support for EV drivers connecting to and utilizing ChargePoint\u2019s Cloud Services and its network of EV charging stations, including customer support services and mobile services. ChargePoint\u2019s support organization faces additional challenges associated with its international operations, including those associated with delivering support, training, and documentation in languages other than English. Failure to maintain high-quality customer support could adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition to providing direct customer support, ChargePoint also relies on channel partners in order to provide frontline support to some of its customers, including with respect to commissioning, maintenance, component part replacements and repairs of charging stations. If ChargePoint\u2019s channel partners do not provide support to the satisfaction of ChargePoint\u2019s customers, ChargePoint may be required to hire additional personnel and to invest in additional resources in order to provide an adequate level of support, generally at a higher cost than that associated with its channel partners, which may increase ChargePoint\u2019s costs and expenses and adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s gross margins. There can be no assurance that ChargePoint will be able to hire sufficient support personnel as and when needed. To the extent that ChargePoint is unsuccessful in hiring, training, and retaining adequate support personnel, its ability to provide high-quality and timely support to its customers will be negatively impacted and its customers\u2019 satisfaction with its Cloud Services and EV charging stations could be adversely affected. Any failure to maintain high-quality customer support, or a market perception that ChargePoint does not maintain high-quality customer support, could adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition, particularly with respect to its fleet customers (see also \u201cRisks Related to ChargePoint\u2019s Business - Supply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, and adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s business and results of operations. For example, supply chain challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic and global chip shortages have impacted companies worldwide and may have adverse effects on ChargePoint suppliers and, as a result, ChargePoint\u201d).\nChargePoint\u2019s business will depend on customers renewing their services subscriptions. If customers do not continue to use its subscription offerings or if they fail to add more stations, its business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nIn addition to selling charging station hardware, ChargePoint also depends on customers continuing to subscribe to its EV charging services and extended warranty coverages. Therefore, it is important that customers renew their subscriptions when the contract term expires and add additional charging stations and services to their subscriptions. Customers may decide not to renew their subscriptions with a similar contract period, at the same prices or terms or with the same or a greater number of users, stations or level of functionality. Customer retention may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including satisfaction with software and features, functionality of the charging stations, prices, features and pricing of competing products, reductions in spending levels, mergers and acquisitions involving customers and deteriorating general economic conditions.\nIf customers do not renew their subscriptions, if they renew on less favorable terms or if they fail to add products or services, ChargePoint\u2019s business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nChanges in subscriptions or pricing models may not be reflected in near-term operating results.\nChargePoint generally recognizes subscription revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their contracts. As a result, most of the subscription revenue reported in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any single quarter will likely have only a small impact on revenue for that quarter. However, such a decline will negatively affect revenue in future quarters. In addition, the severity and duration of events may not be predictable, and their effects could extend beyond a single quarter. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of subscription services, and potential changes in pricing policies or rate of renewals, may not be fully apparent until future periods.\nFinancial, Tax and Accounting-Related Risks\nChargePoint\u2019s financial condition and results of operations are likely to fluctuate on a quarterly basis in future periods, which could cause its results for a particular period to fall below expectations, resulting in a decline in the price of its Common Stock.\nChargePoint\u2019s financial condition and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond its control.\nIn addition to the other risks described herein, the following factors could also cause ChargePoint\u2019s financial condition and results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly basis:\n\u2022the timing and volume of new sales;\n\u2022fluctuations in service costs, particularly due to unexpected costs of servicing and maintaining charging stations;\n\u2022the timing of new product introductions, which can initially have lower gross margins;\n\u2022the introduction of new products by competitors, changes in pricing or other factors impacting competition;\n\u2022weaker than anticipated demand for charging stations, whether due to changes in government incentives and policies or due to other conditions;\n\u2022fluctuations in sales and marketing or research and development expenses;\n\u2022supply chain interruptions, volatility in raw material prices and manufacturing or delivery delays;\n\u2022the timing and availability of new products relative to customers\u2019 and investors\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022the length of the sales and installation cycle for a particular customer;\n\u2022the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on ChargePoint\u2019s workforce, or those of its customers, suppliers, vendors or business partners;\n\u2022disruptions in sales, production, service or other business activities or ChargePoint\u2019s inability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and\n\u2022unanticipated changes in federal, state, local or foreign government incentive programs, which can affect demand for EVs.\nFluctuations in operating results and cash flow could, among other things, give rise to short-term liquidity issues. In addition, revenue, and other operating results in future quarters may fall short of the expectations of investors and financial analysts, which could have an adverse effect on the price of the Common Stock.\nChanges to applicable U.S. tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect ChargePoint\u2019s business and future profitability.\nChargePoint is a U.S. corporation and thus subject to U.S. corporate income tax on its worldwide operations. Moreover, the majority of ChargePoint\u2019s operations and customers are located in the United States, and as a result, ChargePoint is subject to various U.S. federal, state and local taxes. New U.S. laws and policy relating to taxes may have an adverse effect on ChargePoint\u2019s business and future profitability. Further, existing U.S. tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to ChargePoint.\nFor example, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cTax Act\u201d), was signed into law making significant changes to the Code, and certain provisions of the Tax Act may adversely affect ChargePoint. In particular, sweeping changes were made to the U.S. taxation of foreign operations. Changes include, but are not limited to, a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, a reduction to the maximum deduction allowed for net operating losses generated in tax years after December 31, 2017, the elimination of carrybacks of net operating losses, adopting elements of a territorial tax system, assessing a repatriation tax or \u201ctoll-charge\u201d on undistributed earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign corporations, and introducing certain anti-base erosion provisions, including a new minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax. The Tax Act could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, and is subject to interpretations and implementing regulations by the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), any of which could mitigate or increase certain adverse effects of the legislation.\nIn addition, the Tax Act may impact taxation in other jurisdictions, including with respect to state income taxes as state legislatures respond to the Tax Act. Additionally, other foreign governing bodies have and may enact changes to their tax laws in\nreaction to the Tax Act that could result in changes to ChargePoint\u2019s global tax position and materially adversely affect its business and future profitability.\nAs a result of ChargePoint\u2019s plans to expand operations, including to jurisdictions in which the tax laws may not be favorable, ChargePoint\u2019s tax rate may fluctuate, ChargePoint\u2019s tax obligations may become significantly more complex and subject to greater risk of examination by taxing authorities or ChargePoint may be subject to future changes in tax law, the impacts of which could adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s after-tax profitability and financial results.\nBecause ChargePoint does not have a long history of operating at its present scale and it has significant expansion plans, ChargePoint\u2019s effective tax rate may fluctuate in the future. Future effective tax rates could be affected by operating losses in jurisdictions where no tax benefit can be recorded under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws. Factors that could materially affect ChargePoint\u2019s future effective tax rates include, but are not limited to: (a) changes in tax laws or the regulatory environment, (b) changes in accounting and tax standards or practices, (c) changes in the composition of operating income by tax jurisdiction and (d) ChargePoint\u2019s operating results before taxes.\nAdditionally, ChargePoint\u2019s operations are subject to significant income, withholding and other tax obligations in the United States and may become subject to taxes in numerous additional state, local and non-U.S. jurisdictions with respect to its income, operations and subsidiaries related to those jurisdictions. ChargePoint\u2019s after-tax profitability and financial results could be subject to volatility or be affected by numerous factors, including (a) the availability of tax deductions, credits, exemptions, refunds (including refunds of value added taxes) and other benefits to reduce ChargePoint\u2019s tax liabilities, (b) changes in the valuation of ChargePoint\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities, (c) expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances, (d) tax treatment of stock-based compensation, (e) changes in the relative amount of ChargePoint\u2019s earnings subject to tax in the various jurisdictions in which ChargePoint operates or has subsidiaries, (f) the potential expansion of ChargePoint\u2019s business into or otherwise becoming subject to tax in additional jurisdictions, (g) changes to ChargePoint\u2019s existing intercompany structure (and any costs related thereto) and business operations, (h) the extent of ChargePoint\u2019s intercompany transactions and the extent to which taxing authorities in the relevant jurisdictions respect those intercompany transactions and (i) ChargePoint\u2019s ability to structure ChargePoint\u2019s operations in an efficient and competitive manner. Due to the complexity of multinational tax obligations and filings, ChargePoint may have a heightened risk related to audits or examinations by U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. taxing authorities. Outcomes from these audits or examinations could have an adverse effect on ChargePoint\u2019s after-tax profitability and financial condition. Additionally, the IRS and several foreign tax authorities have increasingly focused attention on intercompany transfer pricing with respect to sales of products and services and the use of intangibles. Tax authorities could disagree with ChargePoint\u2019s intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes. If ChargePoint does not prevail in any such disagreements, its profitability may be affected.\nChargePoint\u2019s after-tax profitability and financial results may also be adversely impacted by changes in the relevant tax laws and tax rates, treaties, regulations, administrative practices and principles, judicial decisions and interpretations thereof, in each case, possibly with retroactive effect. For example, the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recently entered into force among the jurisdictions that have ratified it, although the United States has not yet entered into this convention. These recent changes could negatively impact ChargePoint\u2019s taxation, especially as ChargePoint expands its relationships and operations internationally.\nThe ability of ChargePoint to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is conditioned upon ChargePoint attaining profitability and generating taxable income. ChargePoint has incurred significant net losses since inception and it is anticipated that ChargePoint will continue to incur significant losses. Additionally, ChargePoint\u2019s ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be limited.\nAs of January 31, 2022, ChargePoint had $737.8 million of U.S. federal and $312.6 million of California net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, of which $549.0 million of the U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely. The U.S. federal and California state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2028. In addition, ChargePoint had net operating loss carryforwards for other states of $270.9 million, which begin to expire in 2023. The Tax Act included a reduction to the maximum deduction allowed for net operating losses generated in tax years after December 31, 2017 and the elimination of carrybacks of net operating losses. It is possible that ChargePoint will not generate taxable income in time to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards.\nIn addition, net operating loss carryforwards and certain tax credits may be subject to significant limitations under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Code, respectively, and similar provisions of state law. Under those sections of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income or tax may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d will occur if there is a cumulative change in ownership by \u201c5% stockholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. ChargePoint has experienced ownership changes since its incorporation and is already subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its existing net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset taxable income or tax liability. In addition, changes in the ownership during its fiscal year ending January 31, 2022 and future changes in ChargePoint\u2019s stock ownership, which are outside of ChargePoint\u2019s control, may trigger further ownership changes. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit\nChargePoint\u2019s use of accumulated state tax attributes. As a result, even if ChargePoint earns net taxable income in the future, its ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset such taxable income or tax liability may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future income tax liability to ChargePoint.\nChargePoint performed an analysis to assess whether an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined by Section 382 of the Code, has occurred from its inception through January 31, 2021. Based on this analysis, ChargePoint has experienced \u201cownership changes,\u201d limiting the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards under Section 382 of the Code by first multiplying the value of the ChargePoint\u2019s stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate, and then applying additional adjustments, as required. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards before utilization. In addition, the Merger during fiscal year 2022 may constitute an ownership change under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code and ChargePoint expects to complete a Section 382 analysis for changes during this period during its fiscal year ending January 31, 2023. ChargePoint\u2019s net operating losses or credits may also be impaired under state law. Accordingly, ChargePoint may not be able to utilize a material portion of the net operating losses or credits. The ability of ChargePoint to utilize ChargePoint\u2019s net operating losses or credits is conditioned upon ChargePoint attaining profitability and generating U.S. federal and state taxable income. ChargePoint has incurred significant net losses since inception and will continue to incur significant losses; and therefore, ChargePoint does not know whether or when the combined carryforwards may be or may become subject to limitation by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code.\nChargePoint\u2019s reported financial results may be negatively impacted by changes in U.S. GAAP.\nU.S. GAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s Accounting Standards Codification, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on reported financial results, and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change.\nChargePoint incurs significant increased expenses and administrative burdens as a public company, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChargePoint faces increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses as a public company that it did not incur as a private company. Sarbanes-Oxley, including the requirements of Section 404, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the securities exchanges, impose additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. Compliance with public company requirements increases costs and make certain activities more time-consuming. A number of those requirements require it to carry out activities ChargePoint has not done previously. In addition, expenses associated with SEC reporting requirements will be incurred. Furthermore, if any issues in complying with those requirements are identified, such as the material weakness as described in this Annual Report and the restatement of ChargePoint\u2019s previously issued consolidated financial statements and related material weakness as described in this Risk Factors section, ChargePoint may be subject to additional costs and expenses to come into compliance (see also \u201cFinancial, Tax and Accounting-Related Risks -ChargePoint has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. If ChargePoint is unable to remediate these material weaknesses, or if ChargePoint identifies additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fails to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, this may result in material misstatements of ChargePoint\u2019s consolidated financial statements or cause ChargePoint to fail to meet its periodic reporting obligations,\u201d and \u201cRisks Related to Legal Matters and Regulations-ChargePoint may face litigation and other risks as a result of the material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting and the restatement of its financial statements,\u201d for more detail). ChargePoint has incurred and could incur additional costs to rectify those or new issues, and the existence of these issues could adversely affect its reputation or investor perceptions. In addition, as a public company, ChargePoint maintains director and officer liability insurance, for which it must pay substantial premiums. The additional reporting and other obligations imposed by these rules and regulations increase legal and financial compliance costs and the costs of related legal, accounting and administrative activities. Advocacy efforts by stockholders and third-parties may also prompt additional changes in governance and reporting requirements, which could further increase costs.\nChargePoint has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. If ChargePoint is unable to remediate these material weaknesses, or if ChargePoint identifies additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fails to maintain an effective internal control over financial reporting, this may result in material misstatements of ChargePoint\u2019s consolidated financial statements or cause ChargePoint to fail to meet its periodic reporting obligations.\nAs a public company, ChargePoint is required to provide management\u2019s attestation on internal controls pursuant to Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. The standards required for a public company under Section 404(a) and Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley are significantly more stringent than those previously required of ChargePoint as a privately-held company. Management may not be able to effectively and timely implement controls and procedures that adequately respond to the increased regulatory compliance and reporting requirements of Section 404(a) and/or Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley. If ChargePoint is not able to implement these additional requirements in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, it may not be able to assess whether its internal control over financial reporting is effective, which may subject it to adverse regulatory consequences and could harm investor confidence.\nIn connection with the preparation and audit of ChargePoint\u2019s consolidated financial statements, material weaknesses were identified in its internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2022. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of ChargePoint\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nChargePoint did not design and maintain an effective control environment commensurate with its financial reporting requirements. Specifically, ChargePoint did not maintain a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate degree of accounting knowledge, experience and training to appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters commensurate with its accounting and reporting requirements. This material weakness contributed to the following additional material weaknesses:\n\u2022ChargePoint did not design and maintain formal accounting policies, procedures and controls over significant accounts and disclosures to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures, including accounting for complex features associated with warrants, segregation of duties and adequate controls related to the preparation and review of journal entries.; and\n\u2022ChargePoint did not design and maintain effective controls related to the valuation of acquired intangible assets, specifically controls over the review of the inputs and assumptions used in the valuation of the acquired assets.\nThe material weakness related to formal accounting policies, procedures and controls resulted in adjustments to several accounts and disclosures related to the Legacy ChargePoint consolidated financial statements for the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The material weakness related to the accounting for complex features associated with warrants resulted in the restatement of the previously issued financial statements of the entity acquired as part of the Merger Agreement related to warrant liabilities and equity. The material weakness related to the valuation of acquired intangible assets resulted in material adjustments to customer relationships and goodwill and related disclosures to ChargePoint\u2019s consolidated financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2022. These material weaknesses could result in a material misstatement of substantially all of ChargePoint\u2019s accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.\nIn addition, ChargePoint did not design and maintain effective controls over certain information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) general controls for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Specifically, ChargePoint did not design and maintain (a) program change management controls to ensure that IT program and data changes affecting financial IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately, (b) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and that adequately restrict user and privileged access to its financial applications and data to appropriate company personnel and (c) testing and approval controls for program development to ensure that new software development is aligned with business and IT requirements. The IT deficiencies did not result in a any misstatements to the consolidated financial statements, however, the deficiencies, when aggregated, could impact maintaining effective segregation of duties, as well as the effectiveness of IT-dependent controls (such as automated controls that address the risk of material misstatement to one or more assertions, along with the IT controls and underlying data that support the effectiveness of system-generated data and reports) that could result in misstatements potentially impacting all financial statement accounts and disclosures that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, ChargePoint management has determined these deficiencies in the aggregate constitute a material weakness.\nChargePoint has continued implementation of a plan to remediate these material weaknesses. These remediation measures are ongoing and include the following:\n\u2022hiring additional finance and accounting personnel to bolster the accounting capabilities and capacity and to establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022designing and implementing controls to formalize roles and review responsibilities to align with the staff\u2019s skills and experience and designing and implementing controls over segregation of duties;\n\u2022providing ongoing training for personnel on accounting, financial reporting and internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022designing and implementing controls to review the accounting for complex features associated with warrants;\n\u2022designing and implementing controls to review the inputs and assumptions used in the valuation of the acquired assets;\n\u2022engaging an external advisor to assist with evaluating and documenting the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and assist with the remediation of deficiencies, as necessary;\n\u2022designing and implementing controls over the preparation and review of journal entries and account reconciliations, including controls over the segregation of duties; and\n\u2022designing and implementing IT general controls, including controls over program change management, the provisioning and monitoring of user access rights and privileges and program development processes and procedures.\nChargePoint\u2019s remediation efforts could continue beyond the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023. At this time, ChargePoint cannot provide an estimate of costs expected to be incurred in connection with implementing this remediation plan; however, these remediation measures will be time consuming, will result in it incurring significant costs, and will place significant demands on its financial and operational resources.\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, ChargePoint has expended, and anticipates it will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. At\nsuch time, ChargePoint\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which its internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect the business and operating results and could cause a decline in the price of ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock.\nRisks Related to Legal Matters and Regulations\nPrivacy concerns and laws, or other domestic or foreign regulations, may adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s business.\nChargePoint relies on data collected through charging stations or its mobile application, including usage data and geolocation data. ChargePoint uses this data in connection with the research, development and analysis of its technologies. Accordingly, ChargePoint may be subject to or affected by a number of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations, as well as contractual obligations and industry standards, that impose certain obligations and restrictions with respect to data privacy and security and govern its collection, storage, retention, protection, use, processing, transmission, sharing and disclosure of personal information including that of ChargePoint\u2019s employees, customers and other third-parties with whom ChargePoint conducts business. National and local governments and agencies in the countries in which ChargePoint operates and in which its customers operate have adopted, are considering adopting, or may adopt laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, storage, processing and disclosure of information regarding consumers and other individuals, which could impact its ability to offer services in certain jurisdictions. Laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, storage, disclosure, security and other processing of individuals\u2019 information can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are particularly stringent in Europe. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, laws, regulations, standards and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security are significant. In addition, some companies, particularly larger enterprises, often will not contract with vendors that do not meet these rigorous standards. Accordingly, the failure, or perceived inability, to comply with these laws, regulations, standards and other obligations may limit the use and adoption of ChargePoint\u2019s solutions, reduce overall demand, lead to regulatory investigations, litigation and significant fines, penalties or liabilities for actual or alleged noncompliance, or slow the pace at which it closes sales transactions, any of which could harm its business. Moreover, if ChargePoint or any of its employees or contractors fail or are believed to fail to adhere to appropriate practices regarding customers\u2019 data, it may damage its reputation and brand.\nAdditionally, existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations may be interpreted in new and differing manners in the future, and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations, and changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could result in increased regulation, increased costs of compliance and penalties for non-compliance, and limitations on data collection, use, disclosure and transfer for ChargePoint and its customers.\nAdditionally, the EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR establishes requirements applicable to the handling of personal data and imposes penalties for non-compliance of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the GDPR may limit the use and adoption of ChargePoint\u2019s products and services and could have an adverse impact on its business. Further, California adopted the CCPA and the California State Attorney General has begun enforcement actions. Although ChargePoint initiated a compliance program designed to ensure CCPA compliance after consulting with outside privacy counsel, ChargePoint may remain exposed to ongoing legal risks and compliance costs related to CCPA and the new California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), which will become effective in most material respects starting on January 1, 2023.\nThe costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security that are applicable to the businesses of customers may adversely affect ability and willingness to process, handle, store, use and transmit certain types of information, such as demographic and other personal information. The EU and the United States agreed in 2016 to the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, which provided one mechanism for lawful cross-border transfers of personal data between the EU and the United States. However, the Court of Justice of the EU issued a decision on July 16, 2020 invalidating the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, thereby creating additional legal risk for ChargePoint. In addition, the other bases on which ChargePoint and its customers rely for the transfer of personal data across national borders is pursuant to standard contractual clauses to legitimize the transfer of personal data to the U.S. and other third countries in compliance with the GDPR. Notably, on June 4, 2021, the European Commission published revised standard contractual clauses, which imposed additional requirements on companies that utilize this method to legitimize transfers of personal data to the U.S. and other third countries. There are a number of legal uncertainties regarding the application of the revised standard contractual clauses and ChargePoint will continue to face uncertainty as regulatory guidance is developed in this area as to whether ChargePoint\u2019s efforts to comply with its obligations under European privacy laws will be sufficient. If ChargePoint or its customers are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which it operates, it could decrease demand for its products and services or require it to modify or restrict some of its products or services.\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups, the technology industry and other industries have established or may establish various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on technology companies. Customers may expect that ChargePoint will meet voluntary certifications or adhere to other standards established by them or third-parties. If ChargePoint is unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could reduce demand for its solutions and adversely affect its business.\nFailure to comply with anticorruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the FCPA and similar laws associated with activities outside of the United States, could subject ChargePoint to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nChargePoint is subject to the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Anti-Bribery Act and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which it conducts activities. It faces significant risks if it fails to comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws that prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from promising, authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to foreign government officials, political parties and private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to any person or securing any advantage. Any violation of the FCPA, other applicable anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, or severe criminal or civil sanctions, which could have a materially adverse effect on ChargePoint\u2019s reputation, business, operating results and prospects. In addition, ensuring compliance may be costly and time-consuming and responding to any enforcement action may result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nFailure to comply with laws relating to employment could subject ChargePoint to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nChargePoint is subject to various employment-related laws in the jurisdictions in which its employees are based. It faces risks if it fails to comply with applicable U.S. federal or state wage laws, or wage laws applicable to its employees outside of the United States. For example, ChargePoint implemented a reduction in force and furloughed employees in 2020, and the attendant layoffs and/or furloughs could create an additional risk of claims being made on behalf of affected employees. Any violation of applicable wage laws or other labor-or employment-related laws could result in complaints by current or former employees, adverse media coverage, investigations and damages or penalties which could have a materially adverse effect on ChargePoint\u2019s reputation, business, operating results and prospects. In addition, responding to any such proceeding may result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nExisting and future environmental health and safety laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating costs or construction costs and restrictions. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in substantial fines or other limitations that may adversely impact ChargePoint\u2019s financial results or results of operation.\nChargePoint and its operations, as well as those of ChargePoint\u2019s contractors, suppliers and customers, are subject to certain environmental laws and regulations, including laws related to the use, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes as well as electronic wastes and hardware, whether hazardous or not. These laws may require ChargePoint or others in ChargePoint\u2019s value chain to obtain permits and comply with procedures that impose various restrictions and obligations that may have material effects on ChargePoint\u2019s operations. If key permits and approvals cannot be obtained on acceptable terms, or if other operational requirements cannot be met in a manner satisfactory for ChargePoint\u2019s operations or on a timeline that meets ChargePoint\u2019s commercial obligations, it may adversely impact ChargePoint\u2019s business.\nEnvironmental and health and safety laws and regulations can be complex and may be subject to change, such as through new requirements enacted at the supranational, national, sub-national and/or local level or new or modified regulations that may be implemented under existing law. The nature and extent of any changes in these laws, rules, regulations and permits may be unpredictable and may have material effects on ChargePoint\u2019s business. Future legislation and regulations or changes in existing legislation and regulations, or interpretations thereof, including those relating to hardware manufacturing, electronic waste or batteries, could cause additional expenditures, restrictions and delays in connection with ChargePoint\u2019s operations as well as other future projects, the extent of which cannot be predicted.\nFurther, ChargePoint currently relies on third-parties to ensure compliance with certain environmental laws, including those related to the disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Any failure to properly handle or dispose of such wastes, regardless of whether such failure is ChargePoint\u2019s or its contractors, may result in liability under environmental laws, including, but not limited to, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), under which liability may be imposed without regard to fault or degree of contribution for the investigation and clean-up of contaminated sites, as well as impacts to human health and damages to natural resources. Additionally, ChargePoint may not be able to secure contracts with third-parties to continue their key supply chain and disposal services for ChargePoint\u2019s business, which may result in increased costs for compliance with environmental laws and regulations.\nChargePoint may face litigation and other risks as a result of the material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting and the restatement of its financial statements.\nFollowing the issuance of the SEC\u2019s Staff Statement on Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Warrants Issued by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies on April 12, 2021, the audit committee of ChargePoint\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), after considering the recommendations of management, determined that it was appropriate to restate ChargePoint\u2019s previously filed financial statements for certain periods of non-reliance. As part of this restatement, ChargePoint identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting.\nAs a result of such material weakness, such restatement, the change in accounting for ChargePoint\u2019s previously outstanding publicly-traded warrants (the \u201cPublic Warrants\u201d) and private placement warrants issued to NGP Switchback, LLC, the sponsor of Switchback (\u201c Private Placement Warrants\u201d), and other matters raised or that may in the future be raised by the SEC, ChargePoint faces\npotential for litigation or other disputes which may include, among others, claims invoking the federal and state securities laws, contractual claims or other claims arising from the restatement and material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting and the preparation of its financial statements. As of the date of this Annual Report, ChargePoint has no knowledge of any such litigation or dispute. However, ChargePoint can provide no assurance that such litigation or dispute will not arise in the future. Any such litigation or dispute, whether successful or not, could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. As of the date of this Annual Report, no Public Warrants and no Private Placement Warrants remained outstanding.\nRisks Related to Ownership of ChargePoint\u2019s Securities\nFuture sales of ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could reduce ChargePoint\u2019s stock price, and any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute existing stockholder\u2019s ownership.\nChargePoint may raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or debt securities in the future. In that event, the ownership of existing ChargePoint stockholders would be diluted and the value of the stockholders' equity in Common Stock could be reduced. If ChargePoint raised more equity capital from the sale of Common Stock, institutional or other investors may negotiate terms more favorable than the current prices of ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock. If ChargePoint issues debt securities, the holders of the debt would have a claim to ChargePoint assets that would be prior to the rights of stockholders until the debt is repaid. Interest on these debt securities would increase costs and could negatively impact operating results. In accordance with Delaware law and the provisions of ChargePoint\u2019s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cSecond A&R Charter\u201d) ChargePoint may issue preferred stock that ranks senior in right of dividends, liquidation or voting to its Common Stock. The issuance by ChargePoint of such preferred stock may (a) reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for payment of dividends to other holders of ChargePoint Common Stock, (b) diminish the relative voting strength of the total shares of Common Stock outstanding as a class, or (c) subordinate the claims of ChargePoint holders of Common Stock to ChargePoint assets in the event of a liquidation. ChargePoint cannot predict the size of future issuances of its Common Stock or securities convertible into Common Stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of its Common Stock will have on the market price of its Common Stock. Sales of substantial amounts of ChargePoint Common Stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of ChargePoint Common Stock.\nConcentration of ownership among ChargePoint\u2019s existing executive officers, directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAs of January 31, 2022, ChargePoint\u2019s directors, executive officers and their affiliates in the aggregate beneficially own approximately 25.4% of the outstanding Common Stock. As a result, these stockholders are able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any amendment of the certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders.\nChargePoint has never paid cash dividends on its capital stock and does not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\nChargePoint has never paid cash dividends on its capital stock and currently intends to retain any future earnings to fund the growth of its business. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend on financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that the Board may deem relevant. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of Common Stock will be the sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nThe price of ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock may be subject to wide fluctuations.\nThe trading price of ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock will be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond ChargePoint\u2019s control. These factors include:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results;\n\u2022failure to meet or exceed financial estimates and projections of the investment community or that ChargePoint provides to the public;\n\u2022issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts or changed recommendations for the industry in general;\n\u2022announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u2022changes in competitive factors;\n\u2022operating and share price performance of other companies in the industry or related markets;\n\u2022sales of shares of ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock into the market pursuant to the exercise of registration rights;\n\u2022the timing and magnitude of investments in the growth of the business;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in laws and regulations, including U.S. monetary policy;\n\u2022additions or departures of key management or other personnel;\n\u2022increased labor costs;\n\u2022disputes or other developments related to intellectual property or other proprietary rights, including litigation;\n\u2022the ability to market new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis;\n\u2022sales of substantial amounts of the Common Stock by the members of the Board, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur;\n\u2022changes in capital structure, including future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt; and\n\u2022general economic, political and market conditions, including those resulting from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and increased trade restrictions by governmental and private entities.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the stock prices of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Broad market and industry factors likely have and may continue to seriously affect the market price of ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe coverage of ChargePoint\u2019s business or its securities by securities or industry analysts or the absence thereof could adversely affect the trading price and volume of ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock and other securities.\nThe trading market for ChargePoint\u2019s securities is influenced in part by the research and other reports that industry or securities analysts publish about ChargePoint or its business or industry from time to time. ChargePoint does not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. If no or few analysts continue equity research coverage of ChargePoint, the trading price and volume of ChargePoint\u2019s securities would likely be negatively impacted. If analysts do cover ChargePoint and one or more of them downgrade its securities, or if they issue other unfavorable commentary about ChargePoint or its industry or inaccurate research, the trading price of ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock and other securities would likely decline. Furthermore, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage or fail to regularly publish reports on ChargePoint, it could lose visibility in the financial markets. Any of the foregoing would likely cause the trading price and volume of ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock and other securities to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in ChargePoint\u2019s governing documents and applicable laws could impair a takeover attempt.\nChargePoint\u2019s Second A&R Charter and Amended and Restated Bylaws (the \u201cA&R Bylaws\u201d) afford certain rights and powers to the Board that could contribute to the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable. ChargePoint is also subject to Section 203 of the DGCL and other provisions of Delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain mergers. Any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of their Common Stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for the Common Stock. ChargePoint\u2019s Second A&R Charter provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a more favorable judicial forum for disputes with ChargePoint or its directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nThe Second A&R Charter requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought on behalf of ChargePoint, actions against current or former directors, officers, stockholders or, subject to certain exceptions, employees for breach of fiduciary duty and certain other actions may be brought in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware or, if that court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, another federal or state court situated in the State of Delaware. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of ChargePoint shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in the certificate of incorporation. In addition, the Second A&R Charter and A&R Bylaws provide that, unless ChargePoint consents in writing to another forum, the federal district courts of the United States shall, to the fullest extent of the law, be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.\nIn March 2020, the Delaware Supreme Court issued a decision in Salzburg et al. v. Sciabacucchi, which found that an exclusive forum provision providing for claims under the Securities Act to be brought in federal court is facially valid under Delaware law. It is unclear whether this decision will be appealed, or what the final outcome of this case will be. ChargePoint intends to enforce this provision, but it does not know whether courts in other jurisdictions will agree with this decision or enforce it.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with ChargePoint or any of its directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Second A&R Charter to be\ninapplicable or unenforceable in an action, ChargePoint may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm its business, operating results and financial condition.\nSales, or the perception of future sales, of a substantial number of shares of Common Stock by ChargePoint\u2019s existing stockholders could cause the price of the Common Stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock. For instance, in connection with the closing of the Merger, ChargePoint and the holders of registration rights in Switchback and Legacy ChargePoint entered into an amended and restated Registration Rights Agreement (the \u201cA&R Registration Rights Agreement\u201d and such holders the \u201cRegistration Rights Holders\u201d). In certain circumstances, the Registration Rights Holders can demand certain underwritten offerings and will be entitled to customary piggyback registration rights. Also, in connection with the consummation of the acquisition of has\u2022to\u2022be gmbh, ChargePoint entered into a registration rights agreement with the former shareholders of HTB providing for the filing of a resale registration statement as more completely described below.\nChargePoint has in the past, and may in the future, file registration statements as a result of such registration rights. For example, on July 12, 2021, ChargePoint filed a resale registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-257855) that relates to the offer and sale from time to time by the selling security holders named in that prospectus of up to 12,000,000 shares of ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock (the \u201cSecondary Offering\u201d). ChargePoint\u2019s directors, executive officers and certain stockholders entered into lock-up agreements with the representatives of the several underwriters, in connection with the Secondary Offering, which expired on September 28, 2021. Further, on October 14, 2021, ChargePoint filed a resale registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-260247) that was declared effective by the SEC that relates to the offer and sale from time to time by the selling security holders named in that prospectus of up to 5,695,176 shares of ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock in connection with the consummation of ChargePoint\u2019s acquisition of has\u2022to\u2022be gmbh.\nAs of July 9, 2021, 224,656,707 shares of ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock or 69.9% of all outstanding shares of its Common Stock were prohibited or otherwise restricted from being sold in the public market under securities laws or lock-up agreements entered into in connection with the Merger or the Secondary Offering. As of October 31, 2021, the lock-up restrictions applicable to the Merger and Secondary Offering had lapsed and no shares of ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock were prohibited or otherwise restricted from being sold in the public market under lock-up agreements. Shares issued upon the exercise of stock options outstanding under ChargePoint\u2019s equity incentive plans or pursuant to future awards granted under those plans will become available for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of applicable vesting schedules, any applicable market standoff, a registration statement on Form S-8 and Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act.\nWarrants are exercisable for ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock, which would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to ChargePoint\u2019s stockholders.\nAs of January 31, 2022, the warrants to purchase Legacy ChargePoint common stock (the \u201cLegacy Warrants\u201d) were exercisable for 35,538,589 shares of Common Stock. Any shares of ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock issued upon exercise of Legacy Warrants will result in dilution to the then existing holders of Common Stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock.\nThe Private Placement Warrants are accounted for as a warrant liability and recorded at fair value with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of ChargePoint\u2019s Common Stock.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, ChargePoint is required to evaluate the Private Placement Warrants to determine whether they should be accounted for as a warrant liability or as equity. As of the date of this Annual Report, no Public Warrants or Private Placement Warrants remained outstanding, however for its accounting for periods ending January 31, 2022, ChargePoint has concluded that the Private Placement Warrants contain provisions requiring liability classification. Therefore, ChargePoint is accounting for the Private Placement Warrants as a warrant liability at fair value upon issuance through the exercise and redemption of the last Private Placement Warrants in February 2022 and recorded changes in fair value as of the end of each reporting period.", "PERMNO": 18937, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "SBE"}
