Risk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the following risks, along with the other information contained in and incorporated into this annual report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that may affect us. Additional risks and uncertainties also may adversely affect our business and operations. If any of the following events actually occur, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nBecause our loan portfolio consists largely of commercial business and commercial real estate loans, our portfolio carries a higher degree of risk than would a portfolio composed primarily of residential mortgage loans.\nOur loan portfolio is made up largely of commercial business loans and commercial real estate loans, most of which is collateralized by real estate. These types of loans generally expose a lender to a higher degree of credit risk of non-payment and loss than do residential mortgage loans because of several factors, including dependence on the successful operation of a business or a project for repayment, the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as residential real estate, and loan terms with a balloon payment rather than full amortization over the loan term. In addition, commercial real estate and commercial loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. Underwriting and portfolio management activities cannot completely eliminate all risks related to these loans. Any significant failure to pay on time by our customers or a significant default by our customers would materially and adversely affect us.\nWe make both secured and some unsecured commercial and industrial loans. Unsecured loans generally involve a higher degree of risk of loss than do secured loans because, without collateral, repayment is wholly dependent upon the success of the borrowers\u2019 businesses. Secured commercial and industrial loans are generally collateralized by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or other assets owned by the borrower and include a personal guaranty of the business owner. Compared to real estate, that type of collateral is more difficult to monitor, its value is harder to ascertain, it may depreciate more rapidly and it may not be as readily saleable if repossessed. Further, commercial and industrial loans generally will be serviced primarily from the operation of the business, which may not be successful, and commercial real estate loans generally will be serviced from income on the properties securing the loans.\nWhile any declines in the value of our real estate collateral securing loans have been reflected in existing reserves, the discounts and reserves we have taken against our loan portfolio based on our internal review of economic conditions and their impact on real estate values in our market areas may be insufficient. Further deterioration in the real estate market or a prolonged economic recovery could adversely affect the value of the properties securing the loans or revenues from borrowers\u2019 businesses, thereby increasing the risk of non-performing loans and increased portfolio losses that could materially and adversely affect us.\nIn addition, while our commercial borrowers are slowly recovering from the recent economic recession, they have been impacted by the continuing decreased levels of consumer and business spending that began during the recession and its aftermath. Small businesses that make up the majority of our commercial borrowers generally do not have the cash reserves to help cushion them from an economic slowdown to the same extent that large borrowers do and thus may be more heavily impacted by an economic downturn. A continued sluggish economy or another economic slowdown may have a negative effect on the ability of our commercial borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which could have an adverse impact on our earnings.\nCurrent market conditions include an over-supply of land, lots and finished homes in many markets, including those where we do business. Construction loans are subject to risks during the construction phase that are not present in standard residential real estate and commercial real estate loans. These risks include:\n\u00b7 the viability of the contractor;\n\u00b7 the value of the project being subject to successful completion;\n\u00b7 the contractor\u2019s ability to complete the project, to meet deadlines and time schedules and to stay within cost estimates; and\n\u00b7 concentrations of such loans with a single contractor and its affiliates.\nReal estate construction and land loans also present risks of default in the event of declines in property values or volatility in the real estate market during the construction phase. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, we may not be able to recover the entire unpaid portion of the loan, may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate amount of time. If any of these risks were to occur, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe federal banking agencies have issued guidance regarding high concentrations of commercial real estate loans within bank loan portfolios. The guidance requires financial institutions that exceed certain levels of commercial real estate lending compared with their total capital to maintain heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements: including board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. If there is any deterioration in our commercial real estate or real estate construction and land portfolios or if our regulators conclude that we have not implemented appropriate risk management practices, it could adversely affect our business and result in a requirement of increased capital levels, and such capital may not be available at that time.\nWe are subject to security and operational risks relating to our use of technology that could damage our reputation and our business.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. System failure or security breaches in our Internet banking activities or other communication and information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, cause us to incur expenses to rectify, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on standard Internet and other security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not protect our systems from damage or compromises or breaches of our security measures. We continue to monitor developments in this area and consider whether additional protective measures are necessary or appropriate, and we have obtained insurance protection intended to cover losses due to network security breaches; there is no guarantee, however, that such insurance would cover all costs associated with any breach, damage or failure of our computer systems and network infrastructure.\nWe rely on certain external vendors. Our business is dependent on the use of outside service providers that support our day-to-day operations including data processing and electronic communications.\nOur business is dependent on the use of outside service providers that support our day-to-day operations including data processing and electronic communications. Our operations are exposed to the risk that a service provider may not perform in accordance with established performance standards required in our agreements for any number of reasons including equipment or network failure, a change in their senior management, their financial condition, their product line or mix and how they support existing customers, or a simple change in their strategic focus. While we have comprehensive policies and procedures in place to mitigate risk at all phases of service provider management from selection to performance monitoring and renewals, the failure of a service provider to perform in accordance with contractual agreements could be disruptive to our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions and results of operations.\nBecause our loan portfolio includes residential real estate loans, our earnings are sensitive to the credit risks associated with these types of loans.\nWe originate and retain in our portfolio residential mortgage loans and intend to increase our origination of these types of loans. While residential real estate loans are more diversified than loans to commercial borrowers, and our local real estate market and economy have performed better than many other markets, a downturn could cause higher unemployment, more delinquencies, and could adversely affect the value of properties securing loans in our portfolio. In addition, should values begin to decline again, the real estate market may take longer to recover or not recover to previous levels. These risks increase the probability of an adverse impact on our financial results as fewer borrowers would be eligible to borrow and property values could be below necessary levels required for adequate coverage on the requested loan.\nOur residential lending department may not continue to provide us with significant noninterest income.\nThe residential mortgage business is highly competitive, and highly susceptible to changes in market interest rates, consumer confidence levels, employment statistics, the capacity and willingness of secondary market purchasers to acquire and hold or securitize loans, and other factors beyond our control. Additionally, in many respects, the mortgage origination business is relationship based, and dependent on the services of individual mortgage loan officers. The loss of services of one or more loan officers could have the effect of reducing the level of our mortgage production, or the rate of growth of production. As a result of these factors we cannot be certain that we will not be able to continue to increase the volume or percentage of revenue or net income produced by the residential mortgage business.\nOur financial condition, earnings and asset quality could be adversely affected if we are required to repurchase loans originated for sale by our residential lending department.\nThe Bank originates residential mortgage loans for sale to secondary market investors, subject to contractually specified and limited recourse provisions. Because the loans are intended to be originated within investor guidelines, using designated automated underwriting and product specific requirements as part of the loan application, the loans sold have a limited recourse provision. In general, the Bank may be required to repurchase a previously sold mortgage loan or indemnify the investor if there is non-compliance with defined loan origination or documentation standards, including fraud, negligence, material misstatement in the loan documents or noncompliance with applicable law. In addition, the Bank may have an obligation to repurchase a loan if the mortgagor has defaulted early in the loan term. The potential mortgagor early default repurchase period is up to approximately twelve months after sale of the loan to the investor. The recourse period for fraud, material misstatement, breach of representations and warranties, noncompliance with law, or similar matters could be as long as the term of the loan. Mortgages subject to recourse are collateralized by single-family residential properties, have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or less, or have private mortgage insurance. Our experience to date has been minimal in the case of loan repurchases due to default, fraud, breach of representations, material misstatement, or legal noncompliance. Should repurchases become a material issue, our earnings and asset quality could be adversely impacted, which could adversely impact our share price.\nIf our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings would decrease.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses that we believe is adequate for absorbing any potential losses in our loan portfolio. Management, through a periodic review and consideration of our loan portfolio, determines the amount of the allowance for credit losses. We cannot, however, predict with certainty the amount of probable losses in our portfolio or be sure that our allowance will be adequate in the future. If management\u2019s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the allowance for credit losses is inadequate to absorb future losses, our losses will increase and our earnings will suffer.\nIn particular, it is more difficult to estimate loan losses for those types of loans - commercial and commercial real estate - that constitute the majority of our portfolio as compared to, for example, residential mortgage loans. Also, because these types of loans tend to have large loan balances, a loss on a single loan could have a significant adverse effect on our operations.\nIn determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover future incurred losses in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance and a corresponding decrease to earnings. Material additions to the allowance could materially decrease our net income. If delinquencies and defaults continue to increase, we may be required to further increase our provision for loan losses.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or further loan charge-offs to the allowance for credit losses. Any increase in the allowance for credit losses or loan charge-offs might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur growth strategy may not be successful, may be dilutive and may have other adverse consequences.\nAs previously mentioned, a key component of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions of other financial institutions or branches of other financial institutions. As consolidation of the banking industry continues, the competition for suitable acquisition candidates may increase. We compete with other banking companies for acquisition opportunities, and there are a limited number of candidates that meet our acquisition criteria. Consequently, we may not be able to identify suitable candidates for acquisitions. If we are unable to locate suitable acquisition candidates willing to sell on terms acceptable to us, our net income could decline and we would be required to find other methods to grow our business. We may also open additional branches organically and expand into new markets or offer new products and services. These activities would involve a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 the time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners;\n\u00b7 using inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or its branches or assets;\n\u00b7 diluting our existing stockholders in an acquisition;\n\u00b7 the time and expense associated with evaluating new markets for expansion, hiring experienced local management and opening new offices or branches as there may be a substantial time lag between these activities before we generate sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n\u00b7 operating in markets in which we have had no or only limited experience;\n\u00b7 taking a significant amount of time negotiating a transaction or working on expansion plans, resulting in management\u2019s time and attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business;\n\u00b7 we may not be able to correctly identify profitable or growing markets for new branches;\n\u00b7 the time and expense associated with integrating the operations and personnel of the combined businesses;\n\u00b7 the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition;\n\u00b7 creating an adverse short-term effect on our results of operations;\n\u00b7 losing key employees and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received;\n\u00b7 time and costs associated with regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 lack of information on a target institution or its branches or assets;\n\u00b7 inability to obtain additional financing (including by issuing additional common equity), if necessary, on favorable terms or at all; and\n\u00b7 unforeseen adjustments, write-downs, write-offs or restructuring or other impairment charges.\nIn addition, we may not be able to integrate successfully or operate profitably any financial institutions we may acquire. We may experience disruption and incur unexpected expenses in integrating acquisitions. Any acquisitions we do make may not enhance our cash flows, business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, particularly during periods in which the acquisitions are being integrated into our operations.\nAlso, the costs to lease and start up new branch facilities or to acquire existing financial institutions or branches, and the additional costs to operate these facilities, may increase our noninterest expense. It also may be difficult to adequately and profitably manage the anticipated growth from the new branches. We can provide no assurance that any new branch sites will successfully attract a sufficient level of deposits and other banking business to offset their operating expenses.\nFurther, we plan to continue to make investments in our infrastructure in the future. We also currently plan to open additional branches in the areas where we now operate and in other markets over the next few years. We anticipate that this will have the short-term effect of, at least temporarily, increasing our expenses at a faster rate than revenue growth, which will have an adverse effect on net income.\nIf we grow too quickly and are not able to control costs and maintain asset quality, growth could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, we may not be successful in our growth strategy, which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing consumers to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds or general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, which may increase as consumers become more comfortable with these new technologies and offerings, could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nStrong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with, among others, commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, mutual funds, and insurance companies operating locally and elsewhere. There are also a number of smaller community-based banks that pursue similar operating strategies as Howard Bank. In addition, some of our competitors have recently offered loans with lower fixed rates and loans on more attractive terms than we have been willing to offer. Our continued profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. The greater resources and deposit and loan products offered by our competition may limit our ability to increase our interest earning assets. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Competition\u201d for more information about competition in our market area.\nThe financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Increased competition among financial services companies due to the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for banks to compete in our market without a retail footprint by offering competitive rates, as well as non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for certain products and services than we can, which could affect our ability to grow and remain profitable on a long-term basis. Our profitability depends upon our ability to successfully compete in our market area. If we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe continually encounter technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven by new or modified products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nNew regulations may negatively impact our mortgage banking business.\nThe Dodd Frank Act required the regulatory agencies to issue regulations that require securitizers of loans retain \u201cnot less than 5% of the credit risk for any asset that is not a qualified residential mortgage.\u201d The rule, issued in 2014, aligns the definition of \u201cqualified residential mortgage\u201d with the definition of \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d as defined by the CFPB for purposes of its regulations. The final rule became effective on February 23, 2015. Compliance with the final rule was required beginning December 24, 2015 with respect to asset-backed securities collateralized by residential mortgages, and is required beginning December 24, 2016 with respect to all other classes of asset-backed securities. The final rule could have a significant effect on the secondary market for loans and the types of loans we originate, and restrict our ability to originate residential mortgage loans.\nWe must comply with extensive and complex governmental regulation, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our growth strategy, and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nThe banking industry is subject to extensive regulation by state and federal banking authorities. Many of these regulations are intended to protect depositors, the public or the FDIC insurance funds, not stockholders. Regulatory requirements affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and many other aspects of our business. These requirements may constrain our operations, and changes in regulations could adversely affect us. The burden imposed by these federal and state regulations may place banks in general, and Howard Bank specifically, at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors. In addition, the cost of compliance with regulatory requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably or increase profitability. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d for more information about applicable banking laws and regulations. Further, if we are not in compliance with such requirements, we could be subject to fines or other regulatory action that could restrict our ability to operate or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Although we believe we are material compliance with all applicable regulations, it is possible there are violations of which we are unaware that could be discovered by our regulators in the course of an examination or otherwise, which could trigger such fines or other adverse consequences\nFurther, regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for credit losses. If regulators require Howard Bank to charge-off loans or increase its allowance for credit losses, our earnings would suffer. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulation, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. For a further discussion, see \u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d\nIn addition, because regulation of financial institutions changes regularly and is the subject of constant legislative debate, we cannot forecast how federal or state regulation of financial institutions may change in the future and impact our operations. Changes in regulation and oversight, including in the form of changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect the service and products we offer, increase our operating expenses, increase compliance challenges and otherwise adversely impact our financial performance and condition. In addition, the burden imposed by these federal and state regulations may place banks in general, and Howard Bank specifically, at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors.\nThe Company and the Bank implemented an enhanced organizational structure to ensure that the risk management activities of the Company are scaled to the entire enterprise.\u200e The office of strategic risk management, reporting to an executive vice president with direct reporting to the CEO and a dotted line reporting to the full board, is responsible for credit, compliance and operational, physical and IT security, legal, reputational and other on and off balance sheet risks.\nFurther, as a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses in connection with compliance with rules of the SEC and the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC.\nA worsening of economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe continue to operate in a challenging and uncertain economic environment. Economic growth continues to be slow and uneven. A return to recessionary conditions or prolonged stagnant or deteriorating economic conditions could significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the demand for our products and services, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Further continuing economic uncertainty, including regarding concerns about U.S. debt levels and related governmental actions, including potential tax increases and cuts in government spending, may negatively impact economic conditions going forward. In addition, an increase in unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, increases in our nonperforming and criticized classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, the FRB, in an attempt to help the overall economy, has among other things kept interest rates low through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. If the FRB increases the federal funds rate in the near term, overall interest rates will likely rise, which may negatively impact the housing markets and the U.S. economic growth. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a negative impact on our borrowers, especially our commercial borrowers, and the values of collateral securing our loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nOur profitability depends on interest rates, and changes in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations will depend to a large extent on our \u201cnet interest income,\u201d which is the difference between the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest-bearing liabilities, such as interest on deposit accounts, and the interest income received from our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities. Changes in interest rates can increase or decrease our net interest income, because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market interest rate changes. When interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. Additionally, an increase in interest rates may, among other things, reduce the demand for loans and our ability to originate loans and decrease loan repayment rates. A decrease in the general level of interest rates may affect us through, among other things, increased prepayments on our loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios and increased competition for deposits. Accordingly, changes in the level of market interest rates affect our net yield on interest earning assets, loan origination volume, loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios, and our overall results. Fluctuations in interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are not predictable or controllable. Therefore, while we attempt to manage our risk from changes in market interest rates by adjusting the rates, maturity, repricing, and balances of the different types of interest-earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, we might not be able to maintain a consistent positive spread between the interest that we receive and the interest that we pay. As a result, a rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our net interest margin and results of operations.\nThe capital rules that were issued require insured depository institutions and their holding companies to hold more capital. The impact of the new rules on our financial condition and operations is uncertain but could be materially adverse.\nIn July 2013, the bank regulators adopted a final rule for the Basel III capital framework. These rules apply to all depository institutions, top-tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $1 billion or more and top-tier savings and loan holding companies and substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us. The rules phase in over time beginning in 2015 and will become fully effective in 2019. The rules apply to Howard Bank and will apply to Howard Bancorp after it achieves total consolidated assets of $1 billion or more. Beginning in 2015, Howard Bank\u2019s minimum risk-based capital requirements are (i) a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital (common Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) ratio of 6% (up from 4%) and (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (the current requirement). Our leverage ratio requirement will remain at the 4% level now required. Beginning in 2016, a capital conservation buffer will phase in over three years, ultimately resulting in a requirement of an additional 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital on top of the minimum common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital requirements, resulting in a required common equity Tier 1 ratio of 7%, a required Tier 1 ratio of 8.5%, and a required total capital ratio of 10.5%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nMonetary policy and general economic conditions will influence our results of operations.\nGovernmental economic and monetary policy will influence our results of operations. The rates of interest payable on deposits and chargeable on loans are affected by fiscal policy as determined by various governmental and regulatory authorities, in particular the FRB, as well as by national, state and local economic conditions. In addition, adverse general economic conditions may impair the ability of our borrowers to repay loans.\nRegulations pursuant to the Dodd Frank Act may adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the U.S. financial services industry.\nThe Dodd Frank Act required the CFPB and other federal agencies to issue many new and significant rules and regulations to implement its various provisions. There are a number of regulations under the Dodd Frank Act that have not yet been fully adopted and implemented and we will not know the full impact of the Dodd Frank Act on our business until such regulations are fully implemented. As a result, we cannot predict the full extent to which the Dodd Frank Act will impact our business, operations or financial condition. However, compliance with these new laws and regulations may require us to make changes to our business and operations and will likely result in additional costs and a diversion of management\u2019s time from other business activities, any of which may adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.\nBecause the Bank serves a limited market area, we could be more adversely affected by an economic downturn in our market area than our larger competitors that are more geographically diverse.\nOur current primary market area consists of the Greater Baltimore Metropolitan Area. Broad geographic diversification is not currently part of our community bank focus. As a result, if our market areas suffer an economic downturn, our business and financial condition may be more severely affected by such circumstances than are our larger competitors. Factors that adversely affect the economy in our target markets could reduce our deposit base and demand for our services and products and increase our credit losses. Consequently, we may be adversely affected, potentially materially, by adverse changes in economic conditions in and around our market areas. Our larger bank competitors, for example, serve more geographically diverse market areas, parts of which may not be affected by the same economic conditions that may exist in our market areas.\nFurther, unexpected changes in the national and local economy may adversely affect our ability to attract deposits and to make loans. In particular, due to the proximity of our primary and secondary market areas to Washington, D.C., decreases in spending by the Federal government, could impact us more than banks that serve a larger or a different geographical area. Such risks are beyond our control and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, the value of our common stock.\nThe small to medium-sized businesses that the Bank lends to may have fewer resources to weather a downturn in the economy, which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan to the Bank that could materially harm our operating results.\nThe Bank targets its business development and marketing strategy primarily to serve the banking and financial services needs of small to medium-sized businesses. These small to medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market share than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience significant volatility in operating results. Any one or more of these factors may impair the borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small to medium-sized business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two persons or a small group of persons, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay a loan. Economic downturns and other events that negatively impact our market areas could cause the Bank to incur substantial credit losses that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend heavily on five key employees, Mary Ann Scully, Robert A. Altieri, Dennis E. Finnegan, Charles E. Schwabe and George C. Coffman, to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and the loss of their services could disrupt our operations and result in reduced earnings.\nMs. Scully is our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Altieri is an Executive Vice President, President of our Mortgage Banking Division and our Chief Specialty Lending Officer, Mr. Finnegan is an Executive Vice President and our Chief Deposit Officer, Mr. Schwabe is an Executive Vice President and our Secretary, Chief Administrative Officer, and Chief Risk Officer, and Mr. Coffman is an Executive Vice President and our Chief Financial Officer. We believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our senior management team. We believe our senior management team possesses valuable knowledge about and experience in the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships would be difficult to replicate. We have entered into an employment agreement with each of Ms. Scully, Mr. Altieri, Mr. Finnegan, Mr. Schwabe and Mr. Coffman and acquired key-person life insurance on each such executive officer, but the existence of such agreements and insurance does not assure that we will be able to retain their services or recover losses associated with the loss of their services. The unexpected loss of the services of Ms. Scully, Mr. Altieri, Mr. Finnegan, Mr. Schwabe or Mr. Coffman could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and operating results, as well as the value of our common stock.\nFederal and state banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we are or become subject as a result of such examinations may adversely affect us.\nState and federal banking agencies, including the FDIC and the Maryland Office of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation, periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a state or federal banking agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we or our management was in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, our business, results of operations and reputation may be negatively impacted.\nMany of our new activities and expansion plans require regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain them may restrict our growth.\nWe intend to complement and expand our business by continuing to pursue strategic acquisitions of banks and other financial institutions. We must generally receive regulatory approval before we can acquire an institution or business. Such regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We may also be required to sell branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, which condition may not be acceptable to us or, if acceptable to us, may reduce the benefit of any acquisition.\nIn addition to the acquisition of existing financial institutions, as opportunities arise, we plan to continue de novo branching as a part of our internal growth strategy and possibly enter into new markets through de novo branching. De novo branching and any acquisition carries with it numerous risks, including the inability to obtain all required regulatory approvals. The failure to obtain these regulatory approvals for potential future strategic acquisitions and de novo branches may impact our business plans and restrict our growth.\nFailure to pay dividends on our Series AA Preferred Stock may have negative consequences, including external involvement in our board of directors.\nIf dividends on the Series AA Preferred Stock are not paid in full for six quarterly dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, and if the aggregate liquidation preference amount of the then-outstanding shares of Series AA Preferred Stock is at least $25.0 million, the total number of positions on our board of directors will automatically increase by two and the holders of the Series AA Preferred Stock, acting as a single class, will have the right to elect two individuals to serve in the new director positions. This right and the terms of such directors will end when we have paid full dividends for at least four consecutive quarterly dividend periods. If full dividends have not been paid on the Series AA Preferred Stock for five or more quarterly dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, we must invite a representative selected by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series AA Preferred Stock, voting as a single class, to attend all meetings of our board of directors in a nonvoting observer capacity. Any such representative would not be obligated to attend any board meeting to which he or she is invited, and this right will end when we have paid full dividends for at least four consecutive dividend periods.\nOur preferred shares impact net income available to our common stockholders and our earnings per share.\nThe dividends declared on the Series AA Preferred Stock reduce net income available to common shareholders and our earnings per common share. The Series AA Preferred Stock will also receive preferential treatment in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.\nWe may be required to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed on attractive terms, or at all.\nWe are required by regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. Our capital requirements for the foreseeable future are currently satisfied. We may at some point, however, need to raise additional capital to support our continued growth, or if our liquidity is adversely affected by external factors such as worsening economic conditions or continued economic uncertainty. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend in part on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations could be materially impaired, or the failure to raise additional capital could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if we decide to raise additional equity capital, your interest in Howard Bancorp could be diluted. Furthermore, if we raise additional capital through the issuance of debt securities, there can be no assurance that sufficient revenues or cash flow will exist to service such debt.\nThe market value of our investments could negatively impact stockholders\u2019 equity.\nAll of our securities investment portfolio as of December 31, 2015 has been designated as available for sale pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 320 - \u201cInvestments. ASC Topic 320 requires that unrealized gains and losses in the estimated value of the available for sale portfolio be \u201cmarked to market\u201d and reflected as a separate item in stockholders\u2019 equity, net of tax. If the market value of the investment portfolio declines, this could cause a corresponding decline in stockholders\u2019 equity.\nOur lending limit may limit our growth.\nWe are limited in the amount we can loan to a single borrower by the amount of our capital. Generally, under current law, we may lend up to 15% of our unimpaired capital and surplus to any one borrower. Based upon our current capital levels, the amount we may lend is significantly less than that of many of our competitors and may discourage potential borrowers who have credit needs in excess of our lending limit from doing business with us. We accommodate larger loans by selling participations in those loans to other financial institutions, but this strategy may not always be available.\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of our employees or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our corporate documents and in Maryland corporate law may make it difficult and expensive to remove current management.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our corporate documents and in Maryland law may render the removal of our existing board of directors and management more difficult. Consequently, it may be difficult and expensive for our stockholders to remove current management, even if current management is not performing adequately.\nOur articles of incorporation limit the liability of our directors and officers.\nOur articles of incorporation provide that, to the full extent permitted by Maryland law, no director or officer of Howard Bancorp will be liable to us or our stockholders for money damages. This limitation could impair the ability of us and our stockholders to recover for damages resulting from acts or omissions of our directors and officers.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to changes in sentiment in the market regarding our operations or business prospects. Factors that may affect market sentiment include:\n\u00b7 operating results that vary from the expectations of our management or of securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7 developments in our business or in the financial service sector generally;\n\u00b7 regulatory or legislative changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations in particular;\n\u00b7 operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;\n\u00b7 changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other material events by us or our competitors; and\n\u00b7 changes in financial markets and national and local economies and general market conditions, such as interest rates and stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility.\nWhile the U.S. and other governments continue efforts to restore confidence in financial markets and promote economic growth, market and economic turmoil could still occur in the near- or long-term, negatively affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the price, trading volume and volatility of our common stock.\nWe can sell additional shares of common stock without consulting stockholders and without offering shares to existing stockholders, which would result in dilution of stockholders\u2019 interests in Howard Bancorp and could depress our stock price.\nOur articles of incorporation currently authorize an aggregate of 10 million shares of common stock, 6,964,918 of which are outstanding as of the date of this report, 137,463 of which are reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding options granted under our stock incentive plans and employment agreements and 608,399 of which are reserved for issuance pursuant to future grants under our stock incentive plans. Our board of directors has the authority to amend our articles of incorporation, without stockholder approval, to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of any class of stock that we have the authority to issue. The board of directors is further authorized to issue additional shares of common stock and preferred stock, at such times and for such consideration as it may determine, without stockholder action. The ability of the board of directors to increase our authorized shares of capital stock, and the existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock, could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging hostile takeover attempts, or of facilitating a negotiated acquisition and could affect the market for and price of our common stock. Because our common stockholders do not have preemptive rights to purchase shares of our capital stock (that is, the right to purchase a stockholder\u2019s pro rata share of any securities issued by Howard Bancorp), any future offering of capital stock could have a dilutive effect on holders of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13532, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "HBMD"}
