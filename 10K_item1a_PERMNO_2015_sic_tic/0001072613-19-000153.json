RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our operations. The following highlights some of the factors that have affected, and in the future could affect, our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we do not overturn the District Court order of non-infringement in our trial with Hewlett Packard involving our Remote Power Patent, our business, results of operations end cash-flow will continue to be materially adversely effected.\nOn November 13, 2017, the HP Jury Verdict was rendered which found that certain claims of our Remote Power Patent were invalid and not infringed by Hewlett-Packard. On August 29, 2018, the District Court (i) granted our motion for judgment as a matter of law that our Remote Power Patent is valid, thereby overturning the HP Jury Verdict of invalidity and (ii) denied our motion for a new trial on infringement. We have appealed the District Court's denial of our motion for a new trial on infringement to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The HP Jury Verdict had a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash-flow for the year ended December 31, 2018 and will continue to do so for the life of our Remote Power Patent (March 2020) unless the District Court order of non-infringement is reversed on appeal. We have been dependent upon our Remote Power Patent for a significant portion of our revenue. As a result of the HP Jury Verdict several of our largest licensees, including Cisco, our largest licensee, notified us in late November 2017 and January 2018 that they will no longer make ongoing royalty payments to us pursuant to their license agreements. If we successfully overturn the District Court judgment of non-infringement in our appeal to the Federal Circuit, certain licensees of the Remote Power Patent, including Cisco, will be obligated to pay us ongoing royalties and all royalties that accrued but were not paid following (and prior to) the HP Jury Verdict in November 2017. If we are unable to reverse the District Court order of non-infringement on appeal, or there is an arbitration ruling that certain of our licensees, including Cisco, are relieved of their obligations to pay royalties and the District Court order of non-infringement is not subsequently reversed on appeal, our business, results of operations and cash-flow will continue to be materially adversely effected.\nOur revenue stream is uncertain.\nWe may not receive significant royalty revenue from our royalty bearing licenses for our Remote Power Patent as we have received in the past. We have been dependent on royalties from licensing our Remote Power Patent for our recurring quarterly revenue. Such recurring revenue from royalty bearing licenses for our Remote Power Patent for the year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $12,053,000 and $10,788,000, respectively. As a result of the HP Jury Verdict and the subsequent District Court order of non-infringement, our revenue from royalty bearing licenses declined to $3,086,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Without significant recurring revenue from our Remote Power Patent, our licensing revenue will be dependent upon litigation outcomes involving our Cox Patent Portfolio, Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio and our ability to monetize our M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio or new patents to be acquired in the future. We currently have a pending consolidated litigation against Google and YouTube involving patents within our Cox Patent Portfolio and a litigation against Facebook involving certain patents within our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio (see \"Legal Proceedings\" at pages 28-30 hereof). Patent litigation is inherently risky and the outcome is uncertain. Accordingly, our future revenue stream is uncertain.\n- 16 -\nOur success is dependent upon our ability to protect our patents.\nOur success is substantially dependent upon our proprietary technologies and our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. We currently own sixty-five (65) patents that relate to various technologies including our Remote Power Patent, Cox Patent Portfolio, Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio, and our M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio. We have successfully defended several challenges to certain claims of our Remote Power Patent and our Cox Patent Portfolio at the USPTO (see \"Legal Proceedings\" at pages 27-30 hereof). However, in November 2017, the HP Jury Verdict was rendered which found that certain claims of our Remote Power Patent were invalid and not infringed by Hewlett-Packard. On August 29, 2018, the District Court (i) granted our motion for judgment as a matter of law that our Remote Power Patent is valid thereby overturning the HP Jury Verdict of invalidity and (ii) denied our motion for a new trial on infringement. We have appealed the District Court's denial of our motion for a new trial on infringement to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In addition, certain patents within our Cox Patent Portfolio are currently being challenged in patent infringement litigation pending in the courts (see \"Legal Proceedings\" at pages 29-30 of this Annual Report). With respect to our patent litigation against Facebook involving certain of our Mirror Worlds patents, on August 11, 2018, the Court granted Facebook's motion for summary judgment on non-infringement and dismissed the case. We have appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (see Legal Proceedings at page 28 hereof). The uncertainty of the outcome of litigation create risk that our efforts to protect our intellectual property assets may not be successful. If we are not successful in protecting our patents, particularly our Remote Power Patent, such an event may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash-flow.\nWe have been dependent upon our Remote Power Patent for a significant portion of our revenue and profit and the patent expires in March 2020.\nOur Remote Power Patent has generated licensing revenue of approximately $144,000,000 from May 2007 through December 31, 2018. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 from royalty bearing license agreements for our Remote Power Patent constituted $15,785,000 (71% of our revenue) and $16,451,000 (100% of our revenue), respectively. If we are not successful on appeal in over-turning the District Court order of non-infringement in our HP trial, and the order is upheld on appeal to the Federal Circuit, certain of our licensees will no longer be obligated to pay us ongoing royalties including Cisco, our largest licensee, unless there is an arbitration ruling that the District Court order on non-infringement does not affect such licensees' obligation to continue to pay us royalties. In such an event, our business, results of operations and cash-flow will continue to be materially adversely effected. In addition, even if we are successful in overturning the District Court order on non-infringement, licensees of our Remote Power Patent will have no further obligation to pay us royalties after the Remote Power Patent expires in March 2020. Accordingly, if we are unable to enter into royalty bearing license agreements by March 2020 with respect to our other patents, we will not receive any recurring royalty revenue and will be entirely dependent upon successful outcomes of litigation involving our other patents for our revenue.\n- 17 -\nSince the HP Verdict in November 2017, we have not received licensing revenue from Cisco and may not receive any such revenue in the future.\nCisco accounted for 43% and 17% of our licensing revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. In addition, Cisco accounted for 53% and 76% of our recurring revenue from royalty bearing license agreements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. We received no licensing revenue from Cisco for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Settlement and License Agreement, dated May 25, 2011, with Cisco (the \"Agreement\") requires Cisco to pay us royalties on a quarterly basis (which began in the first quarter of 2011) based on its sale of PoE products in the United States, up to the maximum royalties per year of $9 million for the remaining term of our Remote Power Patent (March 2020). The royalty payments are subject to certain conditions including that there is no \"Adverse Ruling\" involving our Remote Power Patent as defined in the Agreement. Cisco notified us in January 2018 that, in its view, no further royalty payments are due to us under the Agreement because the HP Jury Verdict constituted an \"Adverse Ruling\" under the Agreement. We disagree with Cisco that either the HP Jury Verdict or the District Court order of non-infringement constituted an Adverse Ruling under the Agreement and relieved Cisco of its obligation to pay us royalties because, among other reasons, the jury verdict finding of non-infringement and the District Court order on non-infringement in our view do not apply to Cisco products. However, our position that the HP Jury Verdict and District Court order is not an \"Adverse Ruling\" entitling Cisco to stop paying us royalties may not prevail. If the District Court order of non-infringement is upheld on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, we will likely continue not to receive royalties from Cisco unless we obtain an arbitration ruling that the District Court order does not affect the obligation of Cisco to pay us royalties under its license agreement. Cisco's non-payment of royalties to us has had, and will continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash-flow.\nWe may lose our entire investment in ILiAD Biotechnologies\nIn December 2018, we agreed to make an investment of $5,000,000 in ILiAD Biotechnologies, LLC, a privately held development stage biotechnology company, dedicated to the prevention and treatment of human disease caused by Bordetella pertussis. The $5,000,000 investment is made in two tranches, $2,500,000 was invested at the closing in December 2018 and $2,500,000 is subject to ILiAD obtaining an \"allowed to proceed\" notification from the FDA prior to December 31, 2019. As an early stage biotechnology investment, our investment involves a high degree of risk including the potential loss of our entire investment.\n- 18 -\nCash dividends may not be continued to be paid.\nOn December 8, 2016, our Board of Directors approved the initiation of a dividend policy which provides for the payment (anticipated in March and September of each year) of a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.05 per common share ($0.10 per common share annually) which we anticipate paying through March 2020 (the life of our Remote Power Patent), provided that we continue to receive royalties from licensees of our Remote Power Patent. In 2017 and 2018 we paid semi-annual cash dividends aggregating $0.10 per common share consistent with our dividend policy. In addition, on February 11, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.05 per common share payable on March 25, 2019 to all common stockholders of record as of March 11, 2019. However, if we are unable to overturn the District Court order of non-infringement on appeal to the Federal Circuit with respect to the HP trial involving our Remote Power Patent, or there is not an arbitration ruling that the District Court order of non-infringement does not apply to certain of our licensees of our Remote Power Patent including Cisco, our largest licensee, our Board of Directors may choose to modify or discontinue the semi-annual cash dividends of $0.05 per common share. Our dividend policy undergoes a periodic review by our Board of Directors and is subject to change at any time depending upon our earnings, financial requirements and other factors existing in the time.\nWe may not be able to capitalize in the future on our strategy to acquire high quality patents with significant licensing opportunities or enter into strategic relationships with third parties to license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property.\nBased upon the success we have achieved to date from licensing our Remote Power Patent (twenty-seven (27) license agreements which have generated approximately $144,000,000 of revenue), the revenue we have generated from our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio ($47,150,000) and establishing a patent portfolio currently consisting of sixty-five (65) patents, we believe we have the expertise and sufficient capital to compete in the intellectual property monetization market and to enter strategic relationships with third parties to develop, commercialize, license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property. However, we may not be able to acquire additional intellectual property or, if acquired, we may not achieve material revenue or profit from such intellectual property. Acquisitions of patent assets are competitive, time consuming, complex and costly to consummate. Our strategy is to focus on acquiring high quality patent assets which management believes have the potential for significant licensing opportunities. These high quality patent opportunities are difficult to find and are often very competitive to acquire. In addition, such acquisitions present material risks. Even if we acquire additional patent assets, we may not be able to achieve significant licensing revenue or even generate sufficient revenue related to such patent assets to offset the acquisition costs and the legal fees and expenses which may be incurred to enforce, license or otherwise monetize such patents. In addition, we may not be able to enter into strategic relationships with third parties to license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property and, even if we consummate such strategic relationships, we may not achieve material revenue or profit from such relationships.\n- 19 -\nWe may not be successful in enforcing or defending our Cox Patent Portfolio, generating additional revenue from our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio or generating revenue from our M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio.\nWe acquired our Cox Patent Portfolio in 2013, which currently consists of twenty-nine (29) patents. We have not yet achieved any revenue from our Cox Patent Portfolio. We are currently enforcing patents within our Cox Patent Portfolio against Google and YouTube, who are challenging these patents (see \"Legal Proceedings\" at pages 29-30 hereof). With respect to our efforts to enforce our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio, we are currently appealing to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granting summary judgment on non-infringement dismissing the case against Facebook. In addition, our recently acquired M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio is not currently being asserted and thus it is not anticipated that this portfolio will generate revenue for at least the next twelve months. We may not have future success in enforcing or defending our Cox Patent Portfolio, Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio or M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio, which would have a negative impact on our revenue and profits.\nA limited number of our licensees for our Remote Power Patent account for a significant portion of our licensing revenue.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, two licensees constituted in the aggregate 66% of our licensing revenue, including Juniper Networks, Inc. (57%) and Polycom, Inc. (9%). For the year ended December 31, 2017, three licensees constituted in the aggregate 67% of our licensing revenue including Cisco (43%), ALE USA Inc. (14%) and Avaya Inc. (10%). It is anticipated that a few licensees will continue to constitute a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future.\nLegislation, regulations, court rulings and actions by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office have materially increased the risk and cost of enforcement of patents and may continue to do so in the future.\nLegislation, regulations, court rulings and actions by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office have materially increased the risk and cost of enforcing patents. U.S. patent laws were amended by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, referred to as the America Invents Act, which became effective on March 16, 2013. The America Invents Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. In general, it attempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation and new administrative post-grant review procedures to challenge the patentability of issued patents outside of litigation, including Inter Partes Review (IPR) and Covered Business Method Review (CBM) proceedings which provide third parties a timely, cost effective alternative to district court litigation to challenge the validity of an issued patent. In addition, the America Invents Act changes the way that parties may be joined in patent infringement actions, increasing the likelihood that such actions will need to be brought against individual parties allegedly infringing by their respective individual actions or activities. The America Invents Act and its implementation has increased the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of patent rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, changes in patent law could adversely impact our business. Such changes may not be advantageous to us and may make it more difficult to obtain adequate patent protection to enforce our patents. Increased focus on the growing number of patent lawsuits, particularly by non-practicing entities (NPEs), may result in further legislative changes which increase the risk and costs of asserting patent litigation.\n- 20 -\nOur pending patent infringement litigations involving our Remote Power Patent, Cox Patent Portfolio and Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio are time consuming and costly.\nWe have an appeal pending to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit with respect to the District Court order of non-infringement in our trial against Hewlett-Packard involving our Remote Power Patent. We have a pending consolidated litigation against Google and You Tube in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In addition, with respect to our litigation against Facebook involving certain patents within our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio, we have an appeal pending to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit of an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granting summary judgment on non-infringement and dismissing the case (see \"Legal Proceedings\" at page 27 of this Annual Report).\nWhile we have contingent legal fee arrangements, or a contingency plus a fixed cash amount arrangement, with our patent litigation counsel in each litigation, we are responsible for all or a portion of the expenses which are anticipated to be material. In addition, the time and effort required of our management to effectively pursue these litigations is likely to be significant and it may adversely affect other business opportunities.\nWe face intense competition to acquire intellectual property and enter into strategic relationships.\nWith respect to our ability to acquire additional intellectual property or enter into strategic relationships with third parties to monetize their intellectual property, we face considerable competition from other companies, many of which have significantly greater financial and other resources than we have. The patent licensing and enforcement business has grown significantly over the past several years and there has been an increase in the number of companies seeking to acquire intellectual property rights from third parties. Companies including, among others, Acacia Research Corporation (NASDAQ:ACTG), Intellectual Ventures, WI-LAN, a subsidiary of Quarterhill Inc. (NASDAQ:QTRH), VirnetX Holdings Corp. (NYSE MKT:VHC), and RPX Corporation seek to acquire or partner with third parties to license or enforce intellectual property rights. It is expected that others will enter this market as well. Many of these competitors have significantly more financial and human resources than us.\nWe may also compete with strategic corporate buyers, litigation funding firms such as Burford Capital Limited, Validity Finance, LLC, Fortress Investment Group, LLC, Parabellum Capital LLC and Bentham Capital LLC, venture capital firms and hedge funds for intellectual property acquisitions and licensing opportunities. Many of these competitors have greater financial resources and human resources than us.\n- 21 -\nOur quarterly and annual operating and financial results and our revenue are difficult to predict and are likely to fluctuate significantly in future periods.\nOur quarterly and annual operating and financial results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period. Our revenue and net income was $22,106,000 and $7,706,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $16,451,000 and $4,133,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our revenue and net income was $65,088,000 and $23,223,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $16,565,000 and $4,107,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Accordingly, our revenue, net income and results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors that are outside our control including, but not limited to, our ability to overturn on appeal the District Court order of non-infringement in our HP trial, our ability and timing in consummating future license agreements for our intellectual property assets, the timing and extent of payments received by us from licensees, the timing and our ability to achieve successful outcomes from current and future patent litigation, whether we will achieve a return on our investment in ILiAD Biotechnologies and the timing of any such distributions, and the timing and our ability to achieve revenue from future strategic relationships.\nThe patent monetization cycle is long, costly and unpredictable.\nThere is generally a significant time lag between acquiring a patent portfolio and recognizing revenue from those patent assets. During this time lag, significant costs are likely to be incurred which may have a negative impact on our results of operations, cash flow and financial position. Furthermore, the outcome of our efforts to monetize our patents is uncertain and we may not be successful.\nWe are currently pursuing litigation to protect our patent rights as we have done in the past (see \"Legal Proceedings\" at pages 27-30 hereof). Such litigation is typically protracted and complex. The costs are typically substantial, and the outcomes are unpredictable. In addition, the Federal courts are becoming more crowded and as a result patent litigation is taking longer.\nUncertainty in the interpretation and application of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act could materially affect our tax obligations.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") may require the collection of information not regularly produced by us, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for certain provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to TCJA, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position.\n- 22 -\nRisk of tax audits and changes in tax laws.\nWe may be audited by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. In August 2018, we were notified by the IRS that we are being audited for 2016. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the periods in which that determination is made.\nIn addition, changes in U.S. federal and state tax laws applicable to us and changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows.\nIn the future we could be classified as a Personal Holding Company resulting in a 20% tax on our PHC Income that we do not distribute to our shareholders.\nThe personal holding company (\"PHC\") rules under the Internal Revenue Code impose a 20% tax on a PHC's undistributed personal holding company income (\"PHC Income\" which means, in general, taxable income subject to certain adjustments). For a corporation to be classified as a PHC, it must satisfy two tests that (i) more than 50% in value of its outstanding shares must be owned directly or indirectly by 5 or fewer individuals at anytime during the second half of the year (after applying constructive ownership rules to attribute stock owned by entities to their beneficial owners and among certain family members and other related parties) (the \"Ownership Test\") and (ii) at least 60% of its adjusted ordinary gross income for a taxable year consists of dividends, interest, royalties, annuities and rents (the \"Income Test\"). During the second half of 2018 (as well as prior years), we did not meet the Ownership Test. Due to the significant number of shares held by our largest shareholders, we continually assess our share ownership to determine whether it meets the Ownership Test. If the Ownership Test were met and the income generated by us were determined to constitute \"royalties\" within the meaning of the Income Test, we would constitute a PHC and we would be subject to a 20% tax on the amount of any PHC Income that we do not distribute to our shareholders.\nDependence upon CEO and Chairman\nOur success is largely dependent upon the personal efforts of Corey M. Horowitz, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors. On July 14, 2016, we entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Horowitz pursuant to which he continues to serve as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for a five year term. The loss of the services of Mr. Horowitz would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. We do not maintain key-man life insurance on the life of Mr. Horowitz.\n- 23 -\nIt may be difficult for us to verify royalty amounts owed to us under our license agreements with our licensees including Cisco, and this may cause us to lose potential revenue.\nThe standard terms of our royalty bearing license agreements require our licensees to report the sale of licensed products and report this data to us in most cases on a quarterly basis. Although our standard license terms give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees to verify this information, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. From time to time, we may audit certain of our licensees (as we did with Cisco in 2014 resulting in additional licensing revenue of $3,281,000) to verify independently the accuracy of the information contained in their royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we will not receive the revenue to which we are entitled under the terms of our license agreements. However, we cannot give assurances that these audits will be frequent enough and/or effective to that end. There is no certainty that we will receive additional revenue from an audit and in some cases there may be an over-payment which will be credited against future royalties under our license agreements.\nOur markets are subject to rapid technological change and our technologies face potential technology obsolescence.\nThe markets covered by our intellectual property are characterized by rapid technological changes, changing customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards may render our technologies obsolete or less marketable.\nIn addition, other companies may develop competing technologies that offer better or less expensive alternatives to PoE and the other technologies covered by our intellectual property. Moreover, technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by other companies or adopted by various standards groups could render our Remote Power Patent and our other patents obsolete, less marketable or unenforceable.\nThe burdens of being a public company may adversely affect us including our ability to pursue litigation.\nAs a public company, our management must devote substantial time, attention and financial resources to comply with U.S. securities laws. This may have a material adverse effect on management's ability to effectively and efficiently pursue its business. In addition, our disclosure obligations under U.S. securities laws require us to disclose information publicly that will be available to litigation opponents. We may, from time to time, be required to disclose information that may have a material adverse effect on our litigation strategies. This information may enable our litigation opponents to develop effective litigation strategies that are contrary to our interests.\n- 24 -\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nInvestors may have limited influence on stockholder decisions because ownership of our common stock is concentrated.\nAs of March 15, 2019, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned 31.5% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders may be able to exercise substantial control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership will limit other stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us.\nOur common stock may be delisted from the NYSE American exchange if we fail to comply with continued listing standards.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the NYSE American market under the symbol \"NTIP\". If we fail to meet any of the continued listing standards of the NYSE American, our common stock could be delisted from NYSE American. Such delisting could adversely affect the price and trading (including liquidity) of our common stock.\nThe significant number of options and restricted stock units outstanding may adversely affect the market price for our common stock.\nAs of March 15, 2019, there were outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 1,600,000 shares of our common stock at exercise prices ranging from $0.83 to $2.34. In addition, we have outstanding restricted stock units which if fully vested result in the issuance of an additional 493,750 shares of common stock. To the extent that outstanding stock options are exercised and restricted stock units become vested, existing stockholder percentage ownership will be diluted and any sales in the public market of the common stock underlying such stock options or restricted stock units may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nWe may seek to raise additional funds, finance intellectual property acquisitions or develop strategic relationships by issuing capital stock that would dilute your ownership.\nWe may elect to raise financing by issuing equity securities, which, if conducted in the future, would materially reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. We may also issue common stock as consideration for intellectual property acquisitions or other acquisitions. Furthermore, any newly issued securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing common stock. Moreover, any issuances by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our stock and in any event may have a dilutive impact on your ownership interest, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. We may also raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt or the issuance or sale of other securities or instruments senior to our common shares. The holders of any debt securities or instruments we may issue could have rights superior to the rights of our common stockholders.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock may cause the prevailing market price of our shares to decline and could harm our ability to raise additional capital.\nWe have previously issued a substantial number of shares of restricted common stock, which are eligible for resale under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, and may become freely tradable. We have also registered a substantial number of shares including shares that are issuable upon the exercise of stock options and pursuant to vested restricted stock units. In addition, if holders of stock options choose to exercise their purchase rights or restricted stock units vest, and such parties sell shares of common stock in the public market or if holders of currently restricted common stock or registered common stock sell such shares in the public market, or attempt to publicly sell such shares in a short time period, the prevailing market price for our common stock may decline. Such decline in the price of our common stock may also adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.\n- 25 -\nProvisions in our corporate charter, by-laws and in Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, could discourage a takeover and adversely affect existing stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by our board of directors, without further action by stockholders, and may include, among other things, voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, and sinking fund provisions, any of which could adversely affect holders of our common stock. Although there are currently no shares of preferred stock outstanding, future holders of preferred stock may have rights superior to our common stock and such rights could also be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell our assets to third parties.\nWe are also subject to the \"anti takeover\" provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could prevent us from engaging in a \"business combination\" with a 15% or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such person acquired that status unless appropriate board or stockholder approvals are obtained.\nIn addition, our By-laws contain advance notice requirements for director nominations and for new business to be brought up at stockholder meetings.
