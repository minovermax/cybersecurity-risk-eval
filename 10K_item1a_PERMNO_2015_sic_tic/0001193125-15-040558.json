{"cik": "1275283", "company": "REYNOLDS AMERICAN INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRAI and its subsidiaries operate with certain known risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, cash flows and financial position. The risks below are not the only ones that could impact RAI and its subsidiaries. Additional risks not currently known or currently considered immaterial also could affect RAI\u2019s business. You should carefully consider the following risk factors in connection with other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other documents filed with the SEC.\nAdverse litigation outcomes could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI. Additionally, RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries could be subject to substantial liabilities and bonding difficulties from litigation related to cigarette products or smokeless tobacco products, which could also have an adverse effect on their results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nRJR Tobacco, American Snuff Co. and their affiliates, including RAI, and indemnitees, including B&W, have been named in a large number of tobacco-related legal actions, proceedings or claims. The claimants seek recovery on a variety of legal theories, including negligence, strict liability in tort, design defect, failure to warn, fraud, misrepresentation, unfair trade practices, conspiracy, medical monitoring and violations of state and federal antitrust laws. Various forms of relief are sought, including compensatory and, where available, punitive damages in amounts ranging in some cases into the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars.\nThe tobacco-related legal actions range from individual lawsuits to class-actions and other aggregate claim lawsuits. In Engle v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the Florida Supreme Court issued a ruling that, while determining that the case could not proceed further as a class action, permitted members of the Engle class to file individual claims, including claims for punitive damages, through January 11, 2008. The decision preserved several of the Engle jury findings for use in adjudicating these subsequent individual actions, which are now known as Engle Progeny cases. As of December 31, 2014, RJR Tobacco had been served in 3,885 Engle Progeny cases filed on behalf of approximately 4,959 plaintiffs. Many of these cases are in active discovery or nearing trial. In all Engle Progeny cases tried to date, a central issue has been the proper use of the preserved Engle findings. RJR Tobacco has argued that use of the Engle findings to establish individual elements of claims (such as defect, negligence and concealment) is a violation of federal due process. In 2013, both the Florida Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit rejected that argument.\nThe Engle Progeny cases have resulted in increased litigation and trial activity, including an increased number of adverse verdicts, and increased expenses. To date, RJR Tobacco had paid $55,966,859 in compensatory damages and $106,130,000 in punitive damages, for a total of $162,096,859, in these cases. In addition, outstanding jury verdicts in favor of the Engle Progeny plaintiffs had been entered against RJR Tobacco\nin the amount of $136,123,200 in compensatory damages (as adjusted) and in the amount of $163,242,000 in punitive damages, for a total of $299,365,200. All of these verdicts are in various stages in the appellate process. Although RJR Tobacco cannot currently predict when or how much it may be required to pay, RJR Tobacco will likely be required to pay additional judgments as the litigation proceeds. For a more complete description of this litigation, see \u201c- Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry - Engle and Engle Progeny Cases\u201d in Item 8, note 12 to consolidated financial statements.\nClass-action suits have been filed in a number of states against individual cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco, and their parents, including RAI, alleging that the use of the terms \u201clights\u201d and \u201cultra-lights\u201d constitutes unfair and deceptive trade practices. In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that neither the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act nor the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s regulation of \u201ctar\u201d and nicotine disclosures preempts (or bars) such claims. This ruling limits certain defenses available to RJR Tobacco and other cigarette manufacturers and has led to the filing of additional lawsuits. In the event RJR Tobacco and its affiliates and indemnitees lose one or more of the pending \u201clights\u201d class-action suits, RJR Tobacco, depending upon the amount of any damages ordered, could face difficulties in its ability to pay the judgment or obtain any bond required to stay execution of the judgment.\nIn addition, the consolidated action, In re: Tobacco Litigation Individual Personal Injury Cases, is pending in West Virginia, against both RJR Tobacco and B&W. On April 15, 2013, the Phase I jury trial began and ended with a virtually complete defense verdict on May 15, 2013. The only claim remaining after the verdict was the jury\u2019s finding that all ventilated filter cigarettes manufactured and sold between 1964 and July 1, 1969, were defective for a failure to instruct. The court entered judgment in October 2013, dismissing all claims lost by the plaintiffs and purporting to make those claims and all of the jury rulings immediately subject to appeal. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals in November 2013. In October 2014, the West Virginia Supreme Court affirmed the verdict, issuing an opinion without oral argument. In January 2015, the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for rehearing was denied. The trial court has set February 26, 2015, for a hearing to address the remaining ventilated filter claim, which is not expected to result in more than 30 remaining plaintiffs. For additional information, see \u201c- Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry - West Virginia IPIC\u201d in Item 8, note 12 to consolidated financial statements.\nIt is likely that legal actions, proceedings and claims arising out of the sale, distribution, manufacture, development, advertising, marketing and claimed health effects of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products will continue to be filed against RJR Tobacco, American Snuff Co., or their affiliates and indemnitees and other tobacco companies for the foreseeable future.\nVictories by plaintiffs in highly publicized cases against RJR Tobacco and other tobacco companies regarding the health effects of smoking may stimulate further claims. A material increase in the number of pending claims could significantly increase defense costs. In addition, adverse outcomes in pending cases could have adverse effects on the ability of RJR Tobacco and its indemnitees, including B&W, to prevail in other smoking and health litigation.\nAny or all of the events described above could impose substantial monetary obligations on RAI and its operating subsidiaries and could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of these companies and RAI. For a more complete description of the above cases and other significant litigation involving RAI and its operating subsidiaries, including RJR Tobacco and American Snuff Co., see \u201c- Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry\u201d and \u201c- Smokeless Tobacco Litigation\u201d in Item 8, note 12 to consolidated financial statements.\nThe verdict and order in the case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice, while not final, could subject RJR Tobacco to significant compliance costs and adversely affect the sales of RJR Tobacco\u2019s products, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RJR Tobacco and RAI.\nIn 1999, the U.S. Department of Justice brought an action against RJR Tobacco, B&W and other tobacco companies. The government sought, in addition to other remedies, pursuant to the civil provisions of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, referred to as RICO, disgorgement of profits in an amount of approximately $280 billion, which the government contends have been earned as a consequence of a RICO racketeering \u201centerprise.\u201d In 2006, the court found certain defendants, including RJR Tobacco, liable for the RICO claims, but did not impose any direct financial penalties. Instead, the court, among other things, enjoined the defendants from committing future racketeering acts, participating in certain trade organizations, making misrepresentations concerning smoking and health and youth marketing, and using certain brand descriptors such as \u201clow tar,\u201d \u201clight,\u201d \u201cultra light,\u201d \u201cmild\u201d and \u201cnatural,\u201d and ordered the defendants to issue \u201ccorrective communications\u201d on five subjects, including smoking and health and addiction.\nBoth sides appealed. In 2009, the Court of Appeals affirmed in part the trial court\u2019s order and remanded the case for further proceedings. Both sides\u2019 petitions for writ of certiorari from the U.S. Supreme Court were denied in June 2010, including the DOJ\u2019s request for review of the denial of the government\u2019s request for disgorgement of profits and certain other remedies. In November 2012, the trial court specified the text of the \u201ccorrective statements\u201d that it has ordered the defendants to disseminate, which order is currently on appeal, with oral argument scheduled in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on February 23, 2015. The court also ordered the parties to enter mediation on a number of issues related to the implementation of the \u201ccorrective-statements\u201d remedy. The mediation process concluded, and, in June 2014, the district court entered a consent order to govern implementation issues. Aspects of that order are also part of the \u201ccorrective-statements\u201d appeal, and implementation is stayed until all appeals are exhausted. Additionally, further proceedings are pending before the trial court to determine whether the \u201ccorrective statements\u201d will have to be displayed at retail points-of-sale. Implementation of the \u201ccorrective-statements\u201d remedy could cause RJR Tobacco to incur significant compliance costs and there could be an adverse effect on the sales of its products which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RJR Tobacco and RAI.\nFor a more complete description of this case, including the $10 million accrued for the estimated costs of corrective communications, see \u201c- Health-Care Cost Recovery Cases - U.S. Department of Justice Case\u201d in Item 8, note 12 to consolidated financial statements.\nSignificant monetary obligations imposed under the State Settlement Agreements, the size of which may be impacted by suits challenging several arbitration awards favorable to RJR Tobacco, could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RJR Tobacco and RAI.\nIn 1998, RJR Tobacco, B&W and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers entered into the MSA with attorneys general representing most U.S. states, territories and possessions. The State Settlement Agreements, of which the MSA is the most wide-reaching, impose a perpetual stream of future payment obligations on RJR Tobacco and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, and place significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell tobacco products in the future. They have materially adversely affected RJR Tobacco\u2019s shipment volumes, and they are expected to have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RJR Tobacco and RAI in future periods.\nRJR Tobacco disputed a total of $4.7 billion in potential NPM Adjustment claims for the years 2003 through 2012. A nationwide arbitration was initiated with respect to the 2003 NPM Adjustment claim. Preliminary proceedings before the Arbitration Panel began in July 2010. Merits hearings began in April 2012.\nIn December 2012, RJR Tobacco, certain other PMs and certain \u201csignatory\u201d states entered into a binding Term Sheet that set forth terms for resolving accrued and potential NPM Adjustment claims for 2003 through 2012. The Term Sheet also set forth a restructured NPM Adjustment process to be applied on a going-forward basis, starting with the 2013 volume year. The Arbitration Panel for the 2003 NPM Adjustment dispute entered a Stipulated Partial Settlement and Award, reflecting the financial terms of the Term Sheet. Under the settlement, RJR Tobacco is to receive more than $1 billion worth of credits, a portion of which have been applied to its MSA payments in 2013 and 2014, and the remainder is to be applied over the following four years.\nIn September 2013, the Arbitration Panel issued Final Awards on the 2003 NPM Adjustment claim with respect to the 15 states who at that point in the proceedings the PMs continued to contest. The Arbitration Panel ruled that six states (representing approximately 14.68% of the allocable share) - Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Mexico and Pennsylvania - were subject to the 2003 NPM Adjustment. Of these six states, two (Kentucky and Indiana) decided to join the settlement, three (Maryland, Missouri and Pennsylvania) unsuccessfully challenged in their respective state courts the finding of their responsibility for the 2003 NPM Adjustment (appeals are pending); and one state court challenge (New Mexico) has yet to be decided. Additionally, some states challenged the amount of the judgment reduction accorded to them by the Arbitration Panel by virtue of the settlement. Two of these challenges (Missouri and Pennsylvania) were successful; and two were not (Colorado and Maryland). The decisions in Maryland, Missouri and Pennsylvania are on appeal. A similar challenge was filed in New Mexico, but has not yet been decided at the trial court level.\nIf the amount of the judgment reduction is ultimately modified in the manner urged by Maryland and New Mexico, RJR Tobacco\u2019s recovery of the 2003 NPM Adjustment would be reduced by $27 million in the April following the conclusion of the appeal. In contrast, if RJR Tobacco prevails on appeal in Missouri and Pennsylvania, it would receive an additional $75 million for the 2003 NPM Adjustment in the April following the conclusion of the appeal.\nDue to the uncertainty over the final resolution of the 2003 NPM Adjustment claim, no amounts resulting from the rulings of the Arbitration Panel for the four non-diligent states that have not joined the settlement have been recognized in RAI\u2019s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2014. Any adverse decisions on the pending motions and appeals in these states could impact RJR Tobacco\u2019s receipt, or timing of receipt, of some or all of the remaining amount of RJR Tobacco\u2019s claim.\nFinally, the amounts cited in this risk factor will change, should the proposed Merger be completed.\nFor a more complete description of the State Settlement Agreements and the Arbitration Panel\u2019s awards, see \u201c- Health-Care Cost Recovery Cases - State Settlement Agreements\u201d and \u201c- Health-Care Cost Recovery Cases - State Settlement Agreements - Enforcement and Validity; Adjustments\u201d in Item 8, note 12 to consolidated financial statements.\nReports from the U.S. Surgeon General regarding the risks of cigarette smoking and second-hand smoke may result in additional litigation and regulation that could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RJR Tobacco and RAI.\nThe U.S. Surgeon General has issued reports that attribute negative health consequences to cigarette smoking, including involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke, referred to as second-hand smoke or ETS. On January 17, 2014, the Surgeon General issued an additional report that contends that smoking is linked to a higher number of deaths to Americans than previous estimates, that filtered cigarettes may increase the risk of certain diseases, and that cigarettes are a causal factor in certain conditions and diseases that had not previously been linked to cigarette smoking. Litigation could be stimulated due to these reports, and the Surgeon General\u2019s findings could also cause additional regulations or restrictions to be imposed on the use, manufacture or sale of cigarettes. These factors could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RJR Tobacco and RAI.\nRJR Tobacco\u2019s overall retail market share of cigarettes has been declining. If RJR Tobacco is not able to increase sales and market share of its growth brands, and if RJR Tobacco and RAI\u2019s other operating companies are not able to develop, produce or market new alternative products profitably, the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries could be adversely affected.\nRJR Tobacco\u2019s U.S. retail market share of cigarettes has been declining for a number of years. According to data from IRI/Capstone, RJR Tobacco\u2019s share of the U.S. cigarette retail market was 26.5% in 2014, compared with 26.6% in 2013. In addition, consumer health concerns, changes in adult tobacco consumer preferences and changes in regulations have prompted RJR Tobacco and other RAI operating companies to introduce new alternative products. Consumer acceptance of these new products, such as CAMEL Snus and electronic cigarettes, referred to as e-cigarettes, may fall below expectations, in which event RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries may be unable to replace all or any significant portion of lost revenues resulting from the continuing decline in market share and cigarette consumption generally.\nFurthermore, an RAI subsidiary, RJR Vapor, launched its digital vapor cigarette, VUSE, on a national basis in 2014. If the national launch of VUSE, which was previously in limited distribution, does not prove successful, RJR Vapor\u2019s e-cigarette business could be at a significant disadvantage to other e-cigarette manufacturers, making it difficult for RAI to capitalize upon this potentially expanding category of alternative products, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RJR Vapor and RAI.\nIn addition, RAI\u2019s operating companies may not find vendors willing to produce alternative products, or components or raw materials used in such products, resulting in additional capital expenditures for RAI\u2019s operating companies. The ability of RAI\u2019s operating companies to gain efficient market clearance for new products could also be adversely affected by FDA rules and regulations.\nIf RJR Tobacco\u2019s cigarette market share continues to decline, and if RJR Tobacco and RAI\u2019s other operating companies are not able to develop, produce or market new alternative products to replace past and any future loss of the cigarette market share and declining cigarette sales, then there could be an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries.\nRJR Tobacco is dependent on the U.S. cigarette market, which it expects to continue to decline. In addition, RAI\u2019s subsidiaries will continue to be dependent on premium and super premium cigarette brands. The continued decline in U.S. cigarette consumption, or the transition of consumers away from premium cigarette brands, could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RJR Tobacco and RAI.\nRAI\u2019s subsidiaries are, and, following the Merger, will continue to be dependent on the U.S. cigarette market. The international rights to substantially all of RJR Tobacco\u2019s brands were sold in 1999 to JTI, and no international rights were acquired in connection with the B&W business combination or will be acquired as a result of the Merger. Therefore, RJR Tobacco is dependent on the U.S. cigarette market. In connection with the Merger, RAI is not acquiring any brands outside of the United States, and the assets of Lorillard\u2019s subsidiaries related to the \u201ce-vapor\u201d brand blu (including SKYCIG) are included in the Divestiture. Lorillard, like RAI, previously divested its international cigarette business. After completion of the Merger, RAI\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 U.S. combustible cigarette brands will include, among others, NEWPORT, CAMEL, PALL MALL and NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT.\nU.S. cigarette consumption has declined since 1981, for a variety of factors, including, price increases, restrictions on advertising and promotions, funding of smoking prevention campaigns, increases in regulation and excise taxes, health concerns, a decline in the social acceptability of smoking, increased pressure from anti-tobacco groups, and migration to smoke-free products. U.S. cigarette consumption is expected to continue to decline. MSAi reported that U.S. cigarette shipments declined 3.2% in 2014, 4.6% in 2013 and 2.3% in 2012.\nIn addition, RAI\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 brands are subject to consumer price sensitivities, with certain brands subject to greater price sensitivities than others or competitors\u2019 brands. Some consumers may switch to lower priced brands offered by RAI\u2019s subsidiaries or competitors. As a result of the acquisition of certain of Lorillard\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 brands, which principally consist of Newport, RAI\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 concentration of premium brands would increase significantly. As a result, RAI\u2019s subsidiaries will become more susceptible to consumer price sensitivities after the Merger. A downturn in the economy or other adverse financial or economic conditions could increase the number of consumers switching to a lower priced brand.\nRAI is a holding company and is entirely dependent on the results of its operating subsidiaries. RJR Tobacco is RAI\u2019s largest operating segment. As such, it is the primary source of RAI\u2019s revenue, and the continued decline in U.S. cigarette consumption, or the transition of consumers away from premium cigarette brands, could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI.\nCompetitive actions and pricing pressures in the marketplace could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RJR Tobacco, American Snuff and Santa Fe.\nThe tobacco industry is highly competitive. Among the major manufacturers, brands primarily compete on product quality, price, brand recognition, brand imagery and packaging. Substantial marketing support, merchandising display, discounting, promotions and other financial incentives generally are required to maintain or improve a brand\u2019s market position or introduce a new brand. Competitors may also have certain advantages, including stronger financial position and liquidity, enabling them to better withstand the effects of competition and declines in price.\nIn addition, substantial payment obligations under the State Settlement Agreements adversely affect RJR Tobacco\u2019s ability to compete with manufacturers of deep-discount cigarettes that are not subject to such substantial obligations. For a more complete description of the State Settlement Agreements, see \u201c- Health-Care Cost Recovery Cases - State Settlement Agreements\u201d in Item 8, note 12 to consolidated financial statements.\nInability to compete effectively may result in loss of market share, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries.\nIn the United States, tobacco products are subject to substantial and increasing regulation and taxation, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries.\nTobacco products are subject to substantial federal and state excise taxes in the United States. Certain city and county governments also impose substantial excise taxes on tobacco products sold. Over the last several years, these taxing authorities have significantly increased the magnitude of excise taxes on tobacco products. Increased excise taxes have resulted in declines in overall sales volume and shifts by consumers to less expensive brands, and additional increases could result in future sales declines.\nA wide variety of federal, state and local laws limit the advertising, sale and use of cigarettes, and these laws have proliferated in recent years. For example, many local laws prohibit smoking in restaurants and other public places. Private businesses also have adopted policies that prohibit or restrict, or are intended to discourage, smoking. These laws and regulations also are likely to result in a decline in the overall sales volume of cigarettes, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries. For additional information on the issues described above, see \u201c- Governmental Activity\u201d in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7.\nRAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries are subject to significant limitations on advertising and marketing of tobacco products, which could harm the value of their existing brands and their ability to launch new brands, and could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of these companies and RAI.\nIn the United States, television and radio advertisements of cigarettes have been prohibited since 1971, and television and radio advertisements of smokeless tobacco products have been prohibited since 1986. Under the MSA, RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries, RJR Tobacco and SFNTC, cannot use billboard advertising, cartoon characters, sponsorship of certain events, non-tobacco merchandise bearing their brand names and various other advertising and marketing techniques. The MSA also prohibits targeting of youth in advertising, promotion or marketing of tobacco products, including the smokeless tobacco products of RJR Tobacco. American Snuff Co.\nis not a participant in the MSA. Although these restrictions were intended to ensure that tobacco advertising was not aimed at young people, some of the restrictions also may limit the ability of RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries to communicate with adult tobacco consumers. In addition, pursuant to the FDA Tobacco Act, the FDA has reissued regulations addressing advertising and marketing restrictions that were originally promulgated in 1996. Additional restrictions under the FDA regulations, or otherwise, may be imposed or agreed to in the future. These limitations on the advertising and marketing of tobacco products inhibit RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries from promoting and maintaining the value of their existing brands and limit their ability to launch new brands, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of these companies and RAI.\nThe regulation of tobacco products by the FDA could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI.\nThe FDA Tobacco Act grants the FDA broad authority over the manufacture, sale, marketing and packaging of tobacco products. It is likely that the FDA Tobacco Act could result in a decrease in cigarette and smokeless tobacco product sales in the United States, including sales of RJR Tobacco\u2019s, American Snuff\u2019s and Santa Fe\u2019s brands, and has resulted in an increase in costs to RJR Tobacco, American Snuff and Santa Fe, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI. RAI believes that these rules and regulations may adversely affect the ability of its operating subsidiaries to compete against their larger competitor, Altria Group Inc., which may be able to more quickly and cost-effectively comply with these new rules and regulations. The ability of RAI\u2019s operating companies to gain efficient market clearance for new products could be adversely affected by FDA rules and regulations. In addition, the FDA has announced its intention to issue regulations that would bring e-cigarettes within that agency\u2019s jurisdiction, subjecting these products to many of the requirements already in place for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. The adoption of new rules and regulations could make it more difficult for RAI\u2019s operating companies to grow their e-cigarette business, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI.\nIn 2013, the FDA issued its preliminary scientific evaluation regarding menthol cigarettes, concluding that menthol cigarettes adversely affect initiation, addiction and cessation compared with non-menthol cigarettes. Also in 2013, the FDA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, seeking comments on various issues relating to the potential regulation of menthol cigarettes. In addition, the FDA has the authority to require the reduction of nicotine levels and may also require reduction or elimination of other constituents. Menthol cigarette styles accounted for approximately 30% of RAI\u2019s consolidated net sales in 2014. As a result of the Merger, RAI, through its subsidiaries, will acquire Lorillard\u2019s Newport menthol cigarette styles, which account for approximately 80% of Lorillard\u2019s total consolidated net sales and will be added to the brand portfolio of RAI\u2019s operating companies.\nAlthough it is not possible to predict whether or when the FDA will take actions, if the FDA were to adopt regulations banning or severely restricting the sale of menthol cigarettes, or were to require the reduction of nicotine levels or the reduction or elimination of other constituents, those regulations could have a material adverse effect on the cigarette sales of RAI\u2019s operating companies, including sales of the combined company\u2019s Newport brand, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of those companies and RAI.\nFor a detailed description of the FDA Tobacco Act, see \u201c- Governmental Activity\u201d in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7.\nChanges in and compliance with state or federal legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries.\nIn addition to FDA regulation, the passage of new legislative or regulatory initiatives including those relating to U.S. health-care reform, climate change and other environmental legislation and changes in federal or state wage requirements, could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial\nposition of RAI and its operating subsidiaries. RAI and its operating subsidiaries regularly assess the impact that health-care reform could have on its employer-sponsored medical plans. Due to the breadth and complexity of the health-care reform legislation, the current lack of implementation regulations and interpretive guidance and the phased-in nature of the implementation, it is difficult to predict the overall impact. The passage of new legislative or regulatory initiatives may increase compliance costs, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries.\nIncreases in commodity prices will increase costs and may reduce profitability, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries.\nIncreases in the cost of tobacco leaf, other raw materials and other commodities used in RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries\u2019 products could cause profits to decline which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries.\nCertain of RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries may be required to write down intangible assets, including goodwill, due to impairment, thus reducing operating profit.\nIntangible assets include goodwill, trademarks and other intangibles. The determination of fair value involves considerable estimates and judgment. For goodwill, the determination of fair value of a reporting unit involves, among other things, RAI\u2019s market capitalization, and application of the income approach, which includes developing forecasts of future cash flows and determining an appropriate discount rate. If goodwill impairment is implied, the fair values of individual assets and liabilities, including unrecorded intangibles, must be determined. During the annual testing in the fourth quarter of 2014, the estimated fair value of each of RAI\u2019s reporting units was substantially in excess of its respective carrying value.\nTrademarks and other intangible assets with indefinite lives also are tested for impairment annually, in the fourth quarter. At December 31, 2014, the aggregate fair value of RAI\u2019s operating units\u2019 trademarks and other intangible assets was substantially in excess of their aggregate carrying value. However, at December 31, 2014, the individual fair values of five trademarks were less than 15% in excess of their respective carrying values. The aggregate carrying value of these five trademarks was $427 million at December 31, 2014.\nThe methodology used to determine the fair value of trademarks includes assumptions with inherent uncertainty, including projected sales volumes and related projected revenues, long-term growth rates, royalty rates that a market participant might assume and judgments regarding the factors to develop an applied discount rate.\nThe carrying value of intangible assets is at risk of impairment if future projected revenues or long-term growth rates are lower than those currently projected, or if factors used in the development of a discount rate result in the application of a higher discount rate.\nGoodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets are tested more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The carrying value of these intangible assets could be impaired if a significant adverse change in the use, life, or brand strategy of the asset is determined, or if a significant adverse change in the legal and regulatory environment, business or competitive climate occurs that would adversely impact the asset.\nFor additional information, see Item 8, note 4 to consolidated financial statements.\nIncreases in pension expense or pension funding may reduce RAI\u2019s profitability, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI.\nRAI\u2019s profitability is affected by the costs of pension benefits available to employees generally hired prior to 2004. Adverse changes in investment returns earned on pension assets and discount rates used to calculate\npension and related liabilities or changes in required pension funding levels may have an unfavorable impact on pension expense, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI. During 2014, RAI contributed $10 million to its pension plans and plans to contribute $109 million to its pension plans in 2015. RAI actively seeks to control increases in pension expense, but there can be no assurance that profitability will not be adversely affected. In addition, changes to pension legislation or changes in pension accounting may adversely affect profitability, which could also have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI.\nIn addition, following completion of the Merger, RAI may have to make additional contributions to some or all of the Lorillard defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans.\nFor additional information, see Item 8, note 15 to consolidated financial statements.\nRAI and its operating subsidiaries rely on outside suppliers to manage certain non-core business processes. Any interruption in these services could negatively affect the operations of RJR Tobacco, American Snuff Co. and SFNTC and harm their reputation, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of these companies and RAI.\nIn an effort to gain cost efficiencies, RAI and its operating subsidiaries have substantially completed the outsourcing of many of their non-core business processes. Non-core business processes include, but are not limited to, certain processes relating to information technology, human resources, trucking and facilities. If any of the suppliers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at a satisfactory quality level, RJR Tobacco, American Snuff Co. and SFNTC may fail to operate effectively and fail to meet shipment demand, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of these companies and RAI.\nRAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials. An interruption in service from any of these suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI.\nRAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries rely on a limited number of suppliers for raw materials. If a supplier fails to meet any of RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries\u2019 demands for raw materials, any such operating subsidiary may fail to operate effectively and may fail to meet shipment demand, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI.\nCertain of RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries face a customer concentration risk. The loss of such a customer would result in a decline in revenue and could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI.\nRevenues from two distributors, McLane and Core-Mark, constituted approximately 31% and 11%, respectively, of RAI\u2019s consolidated revenue in 2014. The loss of these customers, or a significant decline in their purchases, could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI.\nFire, violent weather conditions and other disasters could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries.\nA major fire, violent weather conditions or other disasters that affect manufacturing and other facilities of RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries, or of their suppliers and vendors, could have a material adverse effect on the operations of RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries. In particular, RJR Tobacco\u2019s cigarette manufacturing is conducted primarily at a single facility. Additionally, SFNTC\u2019s cigarette manufacturing is conducted at a single facility. Despite RAI\u2019s insurance coverage for some of these events, a prolonged interruption in the manufacturing operations of RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on the ability of its operating subsidiaries to effectively operate their businesses, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of these companies.\nThe loss of key personnel, in the regular course of business or as a result of uncertainties associated with the Merger, or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries.\nThe future success of RAI and its operating subsidiaries is dependent on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel. The loss of any executive officers or other key senior management personnel could inhibit the ability of RAI and its operating subsidiaries to manage effectively their businesses. Specifically, as a result of the Merger, employees of RAI and Lorillard and their respective subsidiaries may experience uncertainty about their roles within RAI or Imperial Sub following the Merger. This uncertainty may inhibit the ability to retain those executive officers, other key senior management personnel and other key employees following the Merger. RAI\u2019s success after the Merger will depend in part upon its ability and the abilities of its subsidiaries to retain and hire executive officers, other key senior management personnel and other key employees.\nIn addition, recruiting and retaining qualified personnel may be difficult given the health and social issues associated with the tobacco industry. If RAI and its operating subsidiaries are unable to recruit, retain and motivate key personnel to maintain the current businesses of these companies and support development of new products, it could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of these companies.\nDisruptions in information technology systems or a security breach could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries.\nRAI and its operating subsidiaries are dependent on information technology systems to operate their businesses, enhance customer service, improve the efficiency of production and increase employee efficiency. These information technology systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, catastrophic events and user errors. In addition, these information technology systems are also subject to security breaches, including cyber security breaches and breaches of transaction processing that could result in the compromise of confidential customer or consumer data. Any disruptions in information technology systems or a security breach could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries.\nInability to protect the intellectual property rights of RAI and its operating subsidiaries could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of these companies.\nRAI and its operating subsidiaries rely on a combination of trademark laws, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements to protect their intellectual property rights. Although a substantial amount of resources have been devoted to the establishment and protection of intellectual property, these steps may be inadequate to deter misappropriation. Failure to protect sufficiently intellectual property could affect the ability of RAI and its operating subsidiaries to compete effectively and could harm the value of these subsidiaries\u2019 brands. In addition, defending intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. These events could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries.\nChanges in financial market conditions, including adverse changes in the liquidity of financial markets, could result in higher costs and decreased profitability, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI.\nChanges in financial market conditions, including adverse changes in the liquidity of financial markets, could result in additional realized or unrealized losses associated with the value of RAI\u2019s investments. Additionally, these changes could negatively impact RAI\u2019s interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and the return on corporate cash, resulting in increased costs and reduced profitability. Accordingly, the results of\noperations, cash flows and financial position of RAI could be adversely affected. Due to recent market conditions, RAI has invested any excess cash in either low interest or near zero interest investments, thereby lowering interest income. As of December 31, 2014, $24 million of unrealized losses remain in other comprehensive loss. For more information on investment losses, see Item 8, note 3 to consolidated financial statements.\nRAI has substantial long-term debt, will incur additional debt in connection with the Merger and may encounter difficulties or high costs associated with securing financing in connection with the Merger, which could adversely affect its financial position and its ability to obtain financing in the future and react to changes in its business.\nRAI has, in the aggregate, principal outstanding notes of $5.1 billion. In addition, following completion of the Merger, RAI will have substantially increased debt compared to RAI on a recent historical basis. RAI expects to incur approximately $12.5 billion of debt in connection with the Merger as a result of financing to complete the Merger, including financing the cash portion of the Merger Consideration, and debt assumed in the Merger. RAI currently intends to finance the cash portion of the Merger Consideration and related fees and expenses with available cash, up to $500 million in borrowings under its existing revolving credit facility, proceeds from the issuance of debt securities, proceeds from the Divestiture and Share Purchase and, to the extent necessary, borrowings under the Bridge Facility. RAI has announced its intention to pursue financing that would replace or supplement financing available under the Bridge Facility. The Bridge Facility is a 364-day senior unsecured term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $9 billion. It is currently undrawn and may be drawn only in a single drawing upon the closing of the Merger and not thereafter. There is no guarantee that replacement or supplemental financing will be available to RAI at all or on acceptable terms. RAI\u2019s ability to obtain financing to replace or supplement the Bridge Facility will be subject to various factors, including market conditions, operating performance and credit ratings, and may be subject to restrictions in the agreements relating to RAI\u2019s outstanding debt. Additionally, the receipt of financing by RAI is not a condition to completion of the Merger and, accordingly, RAI will be required to complete the Merger (assuming that all of the conditions to its obligations under the Merger Agreement are satisfied) whether or not debt financing or other financing is available at all or on acceptable terms.\nIf RAI draws under the Bridge Facility, it will be required to repay or refinance the Bridge Facility within 364 days after the draw date. There is no guarantee that RAI would be able to refinance the Bridge Facility at all or on terms acceptable to RAI. The terms of any debt incurred to refinance the Bridge Facility may be less favorable than the terms of the Bridge Facility or those anticipated under the proposed alternative financing.\nBecause of this increased level of debt as a result of the Merger:\n\u2022\nRAI\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes, and its ability to satisfy its obligations with respect to its indebtedness, may be impaired in the future;\n\u2022\na substantial portion of RAI\u2019s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to it for other purposes;\n\u2022\nRAI may be at a disadvantage compared to its competitors with less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates; and\n\u2022\nRAI\u2019s flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited, and it may be more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions or its business, or be unable to carry out capital spending that is necessary or important to its growth strategy and its efforts to improve operating margins.\nThe agreement relating to RAI\u2019s credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit the flexibility of RAI and its subsidiaries. Breach of those covenants could result in a default under the agreement relating to the facility.\nRestrictions in the agreement relating to RAI\u2019s credit facility limit the ability of RAI and its subsidiaries to obtain future financing, and could impact the ability to withstand a future downturn in their businesses or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. In addition, if RAI does not comply with these covenants, any indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility could become immediately due and payable. The lenders under RAI\u2019s credit facility could refuse to lend funds if RAI is not in compliance with the covenants or could terminate the credit facility. If RAI were unable to repay accelerated amounts, the lenders under RAI\u2019s credit facility could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or liquidation proceeding.\nFor more information on the restrictive covenants in RAI\u2019s credit facility, see Item 8, note 10 to consolidated financial statements.\nThe ability of RAI to access the debt capital markets could be impaired if the credit rating of its debt securities falls. Borrowing costs under RAI\u2019s revolving credit facility could increase as the credit ratings of RAI\u2019s long-term debt falls.\nRAI\u2019s credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, RAI\u2019s cost of capital. The outstanding notes issued by RAI are rated investment grade. Following announcement of the Merger, Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services reaffirmed all of its ratings on RAI, including its BBB- corporate credit ratings, and Moody\u2019s Investor Service placed RAI\u2019s Baa2 senior unsecured rating on review for downgrade. If RAI\u2019s credit rating falls, RAI may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in such amounts, at the times, at the lower interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if its debt maintained its current or higher ratings. Any impairment of RAI\u2019s ability to obtain future financing on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on RAI\u2019s ability to finance the cash portion of the Merger Consideration with the issuance of debt securities or another alternative to the Bridge Facility on terms more favorable than under the Bridge Facility, or to refinance the Bridge Facility if drawn. In addition, future debt security issuances or other borrowings may be subject to further negative terms, including provisions for collateral or limitations on indebtedness or more restrictive covenants, if RAI\u2019s ratings decline.\nRAI\u2019s credit ratings are influenced by some important factors not entirely within the control of RAI or its affiliates, such as tobacco litigation, the regulatory environment and the performance of suppliers to RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries. Moreover, because the kinds of events and contingencies that may impair RAI\u2019s credit ratings and the ability of RAI and its affiliates to access the debt capital markets are often the same kinds of events and contingencies that could cause RAI and its affiliates to seek to raise additional capital on an urgent basis, RAI and its affiliates may not be able to issue debt securities or borrow money with acceptable terms, or at all, at the times at which they may most need additional capital.\nIn addition, the interest rate RAI pays on borrowings under its revolving credit facility is equal to an underlying interest rate plus an applicable margin, which margin is based on the ratings of RAI\u2019s senior, unsecured, long-term indebtedness. If these ratings decline, the applicable margin RAI is required to pay would increase. RAI pays a fee on commitments under its revolving credit facility based on the ratings of RAI\u2019s senior, unsecured, long-term indebtedness. As a result, although the revolving credit facility provides RAI with a source of liquidity, the cost of borrowing under, and of maintaining, that facility could be at a higher rate at a time when RAI most needs to utilize that facility.\nFor more complete information on RAI\u2019s borrowing arrangements, see Item 8, notes 10 and 11 to consolidated financial statements.\nAn adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI or its operating subsidiaries could cause RAI\u2019s Board to depart from or change its historical dividend policy.\nRAI\u2019s Board could, in its discretion, depart from or change its dividend policy at any time. RAI is not required to pay dividends and its shareholders do not have contractual or other legal rights to receive them. RAI\u2019s ability to pay dividends is dependent on its earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, expected cash needs, debt covenant compliance and other factors considered relevant by RAI\u2019s Board. To the extent that RAI or its operating subsidiaries experience an adverse effect on their results of operations, cash flows or financial position, RAI\u2019s Board may decide, in its discretion, to decrease the amount of dividends, change or revoke the dividend policy or discontinue paying dividends entirely. In addition, if RAI does not pay or reduces its historical dividend rate, the market price of its common stock could decline.\nB&W\u2019s significant equity interest in RAI could be determinative in matters submitted to a vote by RAI shareholders, resulting in RAI taking actions that RAI\u2019s other shareholders do not support. B&W also has influence over RAI by virtue of the governance agreement, which requires B&W\u2019s approval before RAI takes certain actions.\nB&W owns approximately 42% of the outstanding shares of RAI common stock and, as a result of the Share Purchase, would continue to own approximately 42% of the outstanding shares of RAI common stock after the Merger. No other shareholder owns more than 10% of the outstanding shares of RAI common stock. Unless substantially all of RAI\u2019s public shareholders vote together on matters presented to RAI shareholders, B&W would have the power to determine the outcome of matters submitted to a shareholder vote, subject to the governance agreement described below.\nMoreover, in connection with the B&W business combination, RAI, B&W and BAT entered into an agreement, referred to as the governance agreement, relating to various aspects of RAI\u2019s corporate governance. Under the governance agreement, the approval of B&W, as a RAI shareholder, is required in connection with, among other things, the following matters:\n\u2022\nthe sale or transfer of certain RAI intellectual property associated with B&W brands having an international presence, other than in connection with a sale of RAI; and\n\u2022\nRAI\u2019s adoption of any takeover defense measures that would apply to the acquisition of equity securities of RAI by B&W or its affiliates, other than a re-adoption of the RAI rights plan in the form permitted by the governance agreement.\nSuch influence could result in RAI taking actions that RAI\u2019s other shareholders do not support.\nUnder the governance agreement, B&W is entitled to nominate individuals to RAI\u2019s Board, and the approvals of the majority of those individuals is required before certain actions may be taken, even though those individuals represent less than a majority of the entire Board.\nUnder the governance agreement, B&W, based upon its current equity stake in RAI, is entitled to nominate five directors to RAI\u2019s Board, at least three of whom are required to be independent directors and two of whom may be executive officers of BAT or any of its subsidiaries. RAI\u2019s Board currently is composed of 12 persons, out of a total potential of 13 members, including four designees of B&W, out of a total potential of five designees. Matters requiring the approval of RAI\u2019s Board generally require the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at a meeting. Under the governance agreement, however, the approval of a majority of B&W\u2019s designees on RAI\u2019s Board is required in connection with the following matters:\n\u2022\nany issuance of RAI equity securities in excess of 5% of its outstanding voting stock, unless at such time B&W\u2019s ownership interest in RAI is less than 32%; and\n\u2022\nany repurchase of RAI common stock, subject to a number of exceptions, unless at such time B&W\u2019s ownership interest in RAI is less than 25%.\nAs a result, B&W\u2019s designees on RAI\u2019s Board may prevent the foregoing transactions from being effected, notwithstanding a majority of the entire Board may have voted to approve such transactions.\nUnder the RAI articles of incorporation, neither BAT nor any director of RAI who is affiliated with, or employed by, BAT is required to present a business opportunity, to RAI if the business opportunity does not primarily relate to the United States. The loss of favorable business opportunities could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI.\nUnless otherwise agreed by the parties, under the RAI articles of incorporation, neither BAT or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates nor any director of RAI who is affiliated with, or employed by, BAT or its subsidiaries and affiliates, including any B&W designated director, is required to present a transaction, relationship, arrangement or other opportunity, all of which are collectively referred to as a business opportunity to RAI, RAI\u2019s Board or any RAI officer or employee if the business opportunity does not relate primarily to the United States. RAI has renounced any expectancy or interest in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any such business opportunity, and BAT and its subsidiaries and affiliates are entitled to act upon any such business opportunity and will not be liable to RAI or any RAI shareholders for taking any such action or not presenting such business opportunity to RAI. As a result, RAI may not be presented with certain favorable business opportunities that are known to BAT or a BAT affiliated director of RAI, and BAT may take advantage and receive the benefits of those business opportunities. The loss of favorable business opportunities could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI.\nB&W\u2019s significant ownership interest in RAI, and RAI\u2019s classified board of directors and other anti-takeover defenses could deter acquisition proposals and make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of RAI without the cooperation of B&W. This could have a negative effect on the price of RAI common stock.\nAs RAI\u2019s largest shareholder, B&W could vote its shares of RAI common stock against any takeover proposal submitted for shareholder approval or refuse to accept any tender offer for shares of RAI common stock. This right would make it very difficult for a third party to acquire RAI without B&W consent. In addition, RAI has a classified board of directors and other takeover defenses in its articles of incorporation and bylaws. B&W\u2019s ownership interest in RAI and these defenses could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of RAI. These deterrents could adversely affect the price of RAI common stock and make it very difficult to remove or replace members of the board of directors or management of RAI without cooperation of B&W.\nRAI shareholders may be adversely affected by the July 30, 2014 expiration of the \u201cstandstill\u201d provisions in the governance agreement. This event enables B&W to, among other things, acquire some or all of the shares of RAI common stock not held by B&W or otherwise seek to influence or gain control of RAI, subject to governance agreement limitations on changes in the composition of RAI\u2019s Board.\nThe \u201cstandstill\u201d provisions contained in the governance agreement generally restricted B&W from acquiring additional shares of RAI common stock, seeking to remove RAI directors not designated by B&W, or taking other specified actions to influence or gain control of RAI. These restrictions expired on July 30, 2014.\nAs a consequence of the expiration of the \u201cstandstill\u201d period, B&W is permitted to increase its ownership interest in RAI without limitation. The RAI shareholder rights plan also expired on July 30, 2014, but RAI\u2019s Board is permitted under the governance agreement to readopt a shareholder rights plan in the form permitted by the governance agreement.\nThe governance agreement limits B&W representation on RAI\u2019s Board to five directors (out of an entire Board of 13 directors), of whom three must be independent of both RAI and BAT. If B&W\u2019s voting percentage of RAI drops below 32%, B&W\u2019s board representation will be reduced to a level approximately proportionate to its level of all RAI equity ownership. The governance agreement also requires B&W to vote for the RAI board-proposed slate of director nominees (unless an unaffiliated third party makes a material effort to solicit proxies voting against that slate). These provisions will remain in effect indefinitely after July 30, 2014, unless all or part of the governance agreement is terminated as described below.\nThe governance agreement and amendments thereto are filed as Exhibits 10.8 to 10.11 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRAI shareholders may be adversely affected if all or part of the governance agreement were to be terminated because in some circumstances the board composition and share transfer restrictions on B&W would no longer apply. These developments could enable B&W to, among other things, acquire some or all of the shares of RAI common stock not held by B&W, seek additional representation on RAI\u2019s Board, replace existing RAI directors, solicit proxies, otherwise influence or gain control of RAI or transfer all or a significant percentage of its shares of RAI common stock to a third party.\nThe governance agreement provides that it will terminate automatically in its entirety if B&W owns less than 15% or if any third party or group controls more than 50% of the voting power of all RAI shares. In addition, B&W may terminate the governance agreement in its entirety if B&W nominees proposed in accordance with the governance agreement are not elected to serve on RAI\u2019s Board or its committees or if RAI has deprived B&W nominees of such representation for \u201cfiduciary\u201d reasons or has willfully deprived B&W or its board nominees of any veto rights.\nB&W also may terminate the obligation to vote its shares of RAI common stock for Board-proposed director nominees, the restriction on Board representation in excess of proportionate representation and the RAI share transfer restrictions of the governance agreement if RAI willfully and deliberately breaches the provisions regarding B&W\u2019s Board and Board committee representation.\nIf the share transfer restrictions in the governance agreement are terminated, there will be no contractual restrictions on B&W\u2019s ability to sell or transfer its shares of RAI common stock on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. These sales or transfers could create a substantial decline in the price of shares of RAI common stock or, if these sales or transfers were made to a single buyer or group of buyers that own shares of RAI common stock, could result in a third party acquiring control of or influence over RAI.\nThe bylaws of RAI designate the state courts of North Carolina or the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina as the sole and exclusive forum for certain legal actions, which could limit the ability of RAI shareholders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with RAI.\nRAI\u2019s bylaws provide that, unless RAI consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the state courts of North Carolina or the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina will be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u2022\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of RAI;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of RAI to RAI or its shareholders;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the North Carolina Business Corporation Act, the bylaws or the articles of incorporation of RAI (as each may be amended from time to time); or\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of RAI\u2019s capital stock may be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions described above. This forum selection provision may limit RAI shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a judicial forum that they find favorable for certain disputes with RAI or its directors, officers or other employees or shareholders.\nThe Merger is subject to the receipt of consents and clearances from certain regulatory authorities that may impose conditions that could reduce the expected synergies and other benefits of the Merger, result in a material delay in, or the abandonment of, the Merger or otherwise have an adverse effect on RAI.\nBefore the Merger can be completed, waiting periods must expire or terminate under applicable antitrust laws, including the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, referred to as HSR Act, and various approvals, consents or clearances must be obtained from certain regulatory entities, including those regulating the cigarette industry. In deciding whether to grant antitrust or regulatory clearances, the relevant authorities will consider the effect of the Merger on competition within their relevant jurisdictions. Although RAI and Lorillard have agreed in the Merger Agreement to use their reasonable best efforts to make certain governmental filings and, subject to certain limitations, obtain the required governmental authorizations, as the case may be, there can be no assurance that the relevant authorizations will be obtained.\nThe governmental authorities from which these authorizations are required have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations. The terms and conditions of approvals that are granted may impose requirements, limitations, costs or restrictions on the conduct of RAI\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 businesses following the closing of the Merger. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, subject to certain conditions, RAI, Lorillard, or their respective subsidiaries could be required to divest, hold separate or otherwise take actions that would limit their ownership or control, or their ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines, properties or services. In addition, governmental authorities could require as a condition to approval of the Merger, among other things, the divestiture of assets that are different from or additional to those included in the Divestiture. Moreover, governmental authorities could seek to prevent or enjoin completion of the Merger, and under the terms of the Merger Agreement, subject to certain conditions, RAI and Lorillard agreed to litigate or defend against any proceeding involving governmental authorities seeking to block the Merger.\nThere can be no assurance that regulators will not impose terms, conditions, requirements, limitations, costs or restrictions that would delay the closing of the Merger, impose additional material costs on or limit the revenues of RAI, or limit some of the synergies and other benefits that RAI and Lorillard expect following the closing of the Merger. In addition, neither RAI nor Lorillard can provide any assurance that any such terms, conditions, requirements, limitations, costs, or restrictions will not result in a material delay in, or the abandonment of, the Merger. Any delay in completing the Merger or any modification to the transactions currently contemplated may adversely affect the synergies and other benefits that RAI expects to achieve if the Merger and the integration of the companies\u2019 respective businesses are completed within the expected timeframe.\nThe Merger is subject to a number of conditions to the obligations of both RAI and Lorillard to complete the Merger, which, if not fulfilled, or not fulfilled in a timely manner, may result in termination of the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger Agreement contains a number of conditions to closing of the Merger that have yet to be satisfied. Many of the conditions to closing of the Merger are not within either RAI\u2019s or Lorillard\u2019s control, and neither company can predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied. If any of these conditions are not satisfied or waived prior to July 15, 2015, which date will automatically be extended to January 16, 2016 under certain limited circumstances, it is possible that the Merger Agreement may be terminated. Although RAI and Lorillard have agreed in the Merger Agreement to use their reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to complete the Merger as promptly as practicable, these and other conditions to the completion of the Merger\nmay fail to be satisfied. In addition, satisfying the conditions to and completion of the Merger may take longer, and could cost more, than RAI and Lorillard expect. Any delay in completing the Merger may adversely affect the synergies and other benefits that RAI expects to achieve if the Merger and the integration of the companies\u2019 respective businesses are completed within the expected timeframe.\nFailure to complete the Divestiture with Imperial Sub could require RAI to pursue an alternate divestiture transaction, which may be on less favorable terms to RAI.\nIn connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, RAI entered into the Asset Purchase Agreement and Lorillard entered into the Transfer Agreement, in each case with Imperial Sub, and, for certain limited purposes of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Imperial, pursuant to which Imperial Sub agreed, among other things, to acquire the transferred assets and assume certain liabilities of each of RAI and Lorillard and their respective affiliates or subsidiaries. The completion of the Divestiture is subject to a number of closing conditions. Many of the conditions to the closing of the Divestiture are not within either RAI\u2019s, Lorillard\u2019s, Imperial\u2019s or Imperial Sub\u2019s control, and no company can predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied. If any of these conditions are not satisfied or waived prior to July 15, 2015, which date will automatically be extended to January 16, 2016 under certain limited circumstances, the Divestiture will not be completed in the expected time frame and the Asset Purchase Agreement may be terminated.\nIf RAI is unable to complete the Divestiture, subject to certain limitations, RAI would be required to pursue an alternative transaction to divest the transferred assets on terms that may differ from the terms of the Divestiture. There is no assurance as to when any such alternate divestiture transaction would be completed, or that any such alternate divestiture transaction would be completed on terms as favorable to RAI and its shareholders (including, after the Merger, former Lorillard shareholders) as the Divestiture.\nRJR Tobacco\u2019s DORAL brand may be required to be included as part of the Divestiture.\nUnder the Asset Purchase Agreement, RAI will cause its subsidiaries, including RJR Tobacco, to sell to Imperial Sub its WINSTON, KOOL and SALEM brands. In the event that the aggregate market share for these brands is less than 4.9% for the three months ended prior to the month in which closing of the Merger occurs, the Asset Purchase Agreement provides that RJR Tobacco\u2019s DORAL brand will also be sold to Imperial Sub as part of the Divestiture. RAI will not receive any additional purchase price in the event the DORAL brand is included as part of the Divestiture. The DORAL brand represented approximately $231 million of RAI\u2019s consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. As a result, RAI\u2019s post-Merger results will be adversely impacted if the DORAL brand is required to be included as part of the Divestiture.\nThe business relationships of RAI and Lorillard and their respective subsidiaries may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the Merger, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and Lorillard.\nParties with which RAI or Lorillard, or their respective subsidiaries, do business may experience uncertainty associated with the Merger and related transactions, including with respect to current or future business relationships with RAI, Lorillard, their respective subsidiaries or the combined business. RAI\u2019s and Lorillard\u2019s business relationships may be subject to disruption as customers, distributors, suppliers, vendors and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than RAI, Lorillard, their respective affiliates or subsidiaries or the combined business. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI following the closing of the Merger, including an adverse effect on RAI\u2019s ability to realize the expected synergies and other benefits of the Merger. The risk, and adverse effect, of any disruption could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger Agreement subjects RAI and Lorillard to restrictions on their respective business activities.\nThe Merger Agreement subjects RAI and Lorillard to restrictions on their respective business activities and obligates RAI and Lorillard to generally operate their businesses in the ordinary course in all material respects. These restrictions could prevent RAI and Lorillard from pursuing attractive business opportunities that arise prior to the completion of the Merger and are outside the ordinary course of business, and could otherwise have an adverse effect on RAI\u2019s or Lorillard\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nLawsuits have been filed against RAI, the members of RAI\u2019s Board, Lorillard, the members of Lorillard\u2019s Board and BAT, challenging the Merger, which could delay the Merger and prevent the Merger from being completed.\nLorillard, the members of Lorillard\u2019s Board, RAI and BAT were named as defendants in 11 putative class action lawsuits brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery, referred to as the Delaware Court, by Lorillard shareholders challenging the proposed Merger with RAI, referred to as the Delaware Actions. The complaints generally allege, among other things, that the members of Lorillard\u2019s Board breached their fiduciary duties to Lorillard shareholders by authorizing the proposed Merger of Lorillard with RAI. The complaints also allege that RAI and BAT aided and abetted the breaches of fiduciary duty allegedly committed by the members of Lorillard\u2019s Board. To eliminate the burden, expense and uncertainties inherent in the Delaware Actions, on January 15, 2015, the defendants (other than BAT, which was not named in the amended complaint) entered into a memorandum of understanding, referred to as the Delaware Memorandum of Understanding, regarding the settlement of the Delaware Actions. The Delaware Memorandum of Understanding outlines the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement in principle to settle and release all claims which were or could have been asserted in the Delaware Actions. In consideration for this settlement and release, the parties to the Delaware Actions agreed, among other things, that Lorillard and RAI would provide certain supplemental disclosures to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. These supplemental disclosures were included as part of Current Reports on Form 8-K filed by each of RAI and Lorillard on January 20, 2015. The Delaware Memorandum of Understanding contemplates that the parties will negotiate in good faith to agree upon a stipulation of settlement to be submitted as soon as practicable to the Delaware Court for approval. The stipulation of settlement will be subject to customary conditions, including approval by the Delaware Court, which will consider the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the settlement. There can be no assurance that the parties will ultimately enter into a stipulation of settlement or that the Delaware Court will approve the settlement even if the parties were to enter into such stipulation. In such event, or if the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are not consummated for any reason, the proposed settlement of the Delaware Actions will be of no force and effect.\nRAI, the members of RAI\u2019s Board and BAT were named as defendants in a putative class action lawsuit brought in North Carolina state court, referred to as the North Carolina Court, by a person identifying himself as a shareholder of RAI seeking to enjoin the proposed Merger with Lorillard, referred to as the North Carolina Action. The complaint generally alleges, among other things, that the members of RAI\u2019s Board breached their fiduciary duties to RAI shareholders by approving the Share Purchase and the sharing of technology with BAT. The complaint also alleges that there were various conflicts of interest in the transaction, and that RAI aided and abetted the alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by its board of directors. On January 2, 2015, the plaintiff in the North Carolina Action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin temporarily the RAI shareholder meeting and votes scheduled for January 28, 2015. To eliminate certain burdens, expenses and uncertainties inherent in the North Carolina Action, on January 17, 2015, RAI and the director defendants entered into a memorandum of understanding, referred to as the North Carolina Memorandum of Understanding, regarding the settlement of disclosure claims asserted in the North Carolina Action. In consideration of the partial settlement and release, RAI agreed to provide certain supplemental disclosures to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. These supplemental disclosures were included as part of Current Reports on Form 8-K filed by each of RAI and Lorillard on January 20, 2015. The North Carolina Memorandum of Understanding contemplates that the parties will negotiate in good faith to agree upon a stipulation of partial settlement to be submitted to the North Carolina Court for approval as soon as practicable. The stipulation of partial settlement will be subject to\ncustomary conditions, including approval by the North Carolina Court, which will consider the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the partial settlement. There can be no assurance that the parties will ultimately enter into a stipulation of partial settlement or that the North Carolina Court will approve the partial settlement even if the parties were to enter into such a stipulation. In that event, the proposed partial settlement will be null and void and of no force and effect. As is more fully set forth in the North Carolina Memorandum of Understanding, the partial settlement of the North Carolina Action will not resolve or terminate the non-disclosure claims in the North Carolina Action.\nThe Delaware Actions and the North Carolina Action seek injunctive relief enjoining the Merger, damages and reimbursement of costs, among other remedies. If the Delaware Actions and the North Carolina Action stipulations of settlement are not ultimately entered into or are not approved by the Delaware Court and North Carolina Court, respectively, then the respective proposed settlement will be of no force and effect and the associated action will most likely continue to proceed. Alternatively, the parties to the Delaware Actions and the North Carolina Action may enter into new memoranda of understanding, which may be on terms less favorable to RAI and Lorillard. Further, as the North Carolina Memorandum of Understanding relates only to a partial settlement, the non-disclosure claims in the North Carolina Action have not been resolved or terminated and will continue to be litigated. There can be no assurance that there will be a favorable resolution of the remaining claims in the North Carolina Action. Additional lawsuits, including those seeking statutory appraisal of dissenting shareholder shares, may be filed in connection with the Merger. It is possible that RAI\u2019s consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of the Delaware Actions, the North Carolina Action or future litigation matters. Additionally, it is possible that the outcomes of the Delaware Actions, the North Carolina Action and any future lawsuits challenging the Merger could result in a material delay in, or the abandonment of, the Merger, or could result in RAI being required to pay damages. For more information about the lawsuits that have been filed related to the Merger, see Item 8, note 12 to consolidated financial statements.\nFor a period of time after the Divestiture is completed, RJR Tobacco will be reliant on Imperial Sub to manufacture Newport on RJR Tobacco\u2019s behalf, and RJR Tobacco will manufacture WINSTON, KOOL and SALEM (and, under certain circumstances, DORAL) on Imperial Sub\u2019s behalf. RJR Tobacco\u2019s reliance on Imperial Sub for the manufacture of Newport will subject RAI and RJR Tobacco to risks and uncertainties to which it would not otherwise be subject, and Imperial Sub\u2019s inability to manufacture Newport as currently contemplated could adversely affect RAI and RJR Tobacco\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, financial position and ability to realize any or all of the synergies expected as a result of the Merger and Divestiture.\nRJR Tobacco and Imperial Sub will enter into a reciprocal manufacturing agreement in connection with closing of the Merger and the Divestiture, pursuant to which for a period of up to two years, subject to automatic one-year extensions, Imperial Sub will manufacture Newport (and any other Lorillard brand acquired in the Merger and agreed upon by the parties) on RJR Tobacco\u2019s behalf and RJR Tobacco will manufacture WINSTON, KOOL, SALEM (and, under certain circumstances, DORAL) on Imperial Sub\u2019s behalf. Reliance on Imperial Sub for the manufacture of Newport will subject RAI and RJR Tobacco to risks and uncertainties to which it would not be subject if RJR Tobacco manufactured Newport itself, including, among others:\n\u2022\nreduced control over the manufacturing process and quality control;\n\u2022\ndisruptions to Imperial Sub\u2019s operations and the production of Newport caused by conditions unrelated to RAI\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 businesses or operations, including disputes under collective bargaining agreements with labor unions or in connection with negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements, strikes or other work stoppages at the Imperial Sub plant that manufactures Newport or the occurrence of a catastrophic event affecting Imperial Sub; and\n\u2022\nloss of market share and reputational harm to RAI and RJR Tobacco in the event a disruption of the production of Newport by Imperial Sub results in insufficient supply.\nIn addition, Imperial Sub may not transition the manufacturing of WINSTON, KOOL, SALEM (and, under certain circumstances, DORAL) to the Greensboro plant acquired by Imperial Sub in the Divestiture as quickly as currently contemplated.\nIf Imperial Sub fails to or is unable to perform under the reciprocal manufacturing agreement, RAI\u2019s and RJR Tobacco\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be adversely affected, and there could be a delay to RAI and RJR Tobacco\u2019s ability to realize any or all of the synergies expected as a result of the Merger and Divestiture.\nRAI is obligated to indemnify Imperial Sub for specified matters and to retain certain liabilities related to the divested brands and other assets.\nUnder the Asset Purchase Agreement, RAI will indemnify Imperial Sub against losses arising from, among other things, breaches of representations and warranties, breaches of covenants, assets excluded from the transaction, excluded liabilities, certain specific tobacco liabilities, certain assumed plaintiff fees, certain employment related obligations, and liabilities in connection with certain tobacco litigation, settlement and regulatory matters. The Asset Purchase Agreement does not cap RAI\u2019s indemnification obligations, except with respect to any indemnification arising from breaches of certain representations and warranties or pre-closing covenants. Accordingly, these indemnification obligations could be substantial and could have an adverse effect on RAI\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nThe Merger Agreement and Asset Purchase Agreement limit RAI\u2019s ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire RAI.\nThe Merger Agreement and Asset Purchase Agreement contain provisions that make it more difficult for RAI to pursue alternatives to the Merger and limit the ability to terminate the Merger Agreement. The definition of \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d is limited under the Merger Agreement and Asset Purchase Agreement. Certain events could materially and adversely affect RAI\u2019s or its subsidiaries\u2019 business, but not give rise to a right of termination under the applicable agreement.\nThese provisions could discourage potential third-party acquirers that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of RAI from considering or proposing such an acquisition, or might result in a potential third-party acquirer proposing to pay a lower price to RAI shareholders than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fees that may become payable in certain circumstances.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated and RAI determines to seek another business combination, RAI may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the Merger.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively impact RAI\u2019s stock price and have an adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nIf the Merger is not completed for any reason, the ongoing business of RAI may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, RAI would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nRAI may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on its stock price;\n\u2022\nRAI and its subsidiaries may experience negative reactions from their respective customers, regulators and employees;\n\u2022\nRAI will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed;\n\u2022\nRAI may be required to pay a cash termination fee as prescribed by the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022\nRAI may be required to pay $210 million of any termination fee received from Lorillard to Imperial Sub in the event that a termination of the Merger Agreement results in the termination of the Asset Purchase Agreement, and RAI may be required to pay BAT an expense reimbursement of up to $30 million in the event of termination of the Merger Agreement and up to $8.5 million in the event of termination of the Asset Purchase Agreement;\n\u2022\nthe Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of the business of RAI and its subsidiaries prior to completion of the Merger, which may have prevented RAI from making certain acquisitions, taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities following the signing of the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022\nmatters relating to the Merger (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by RAI management, which could have resulted in the distraction of RAI\u2019s management from ongoing business operations following the signing of the Merger Agreement; and\n\u2022\nlitigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against RAI to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement.\nIf the Merger is not completed, the risks described above may materialize and they may have an adverse effect on RAI\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, financial position and stock price.\nAfter completion of the Merger, RAI may fail to realize the expected synergies and other benefits of the Merger, which could adversely affect the value of RAI common stock.\nThe success of the Merger will depend, in part, on RAI\u2019s ability to realize the expected synergies and other benefits from combining the businesses of RAI and Lorillard and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates. RAI\u2019s ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to certain risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of RAI, Lorillard and their respective subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nRAI\u2019s ability to reduce its level of indebtedness in a timely manner following the Merger; and\n\u2022\nthe ability to successfully transition manufacturing of Newport from Lorillard\u2019s manufacturing facility to RJR Tobacco\u2019s manufacturing facility when and as expected.\nIf RAI is not able to successfully combine the businesses of RAI, Lorillard and their respective subsidiaries within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected synergies and other benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined businesses may not perform as expected and the value of the RAI common stock (including the stock portion of the Merger Consideration) may be adversely affected. In addition, if RAI is unable to timely reduce its level of indebtedness following the Merger, RAI will be subject to increased demands on its cash resources and tightening financial covenants under its revolving credit agreement, which could result in a breach of the covenants or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company.\nFurther, RAI and Lorillard and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates have operated and, until completion of the Merger, will continue to operate, independently, and there can be no assurances that their businesses can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees or customers of RAI or Lorillard or their respective subsidiaries, the disruption of the companies\u2019\nongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-Merger integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. RAI will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of RAI and Lorillard. It is possible that the integration process could result in:\n\u2022\ndiversion of the attention of each company\u2019s management;\n\u2022\nthe lack of personnel or other resources to pursue other potential business opportunities, such as possible acquisition opportunities; and\n\u2022\nthe disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies,\nany of which could adversely affect each company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or their ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger or could reduce each company\u2019s earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company.\nAccordingly, even if the Merger is completed, the contemplated benefits may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nRAI will incur significant transaction related costs in connection with the Merger and Divestiture.\nRAI has incurred and expects to incur significant costs associated with the Merger, Divestiture and combining the operations of the two companies. The significant costs associated with the Merger and Divestiture include, among others, fees and expenses of financial advisors and other advisors and representatives, certain employment-related costs relating to employees of Lorillard, litigation costs, costs of public relations firms engaged in connection with the Merger, filing fees due in connection with filings required under the HSR Act and filing fees and printing and mailing costs for the definitive Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Some of these costs have already been incurred or may be incurred regardless of whether the Merger and Divestiture are completed, including a portion of the fees and expenses of financial advisors and other advisors and representatives, filing fees under the HSR Act and fees and expenses related to the definitive Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. RAI also will incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans with respect to the two companies, including facilities and systems consolidation costs. Furthermore, the transaction fees and costs associated with the Divestiture could deviate from RAI\u2019s current expectations, particularly if Imperial Sub fails to or is unable to perform under the reciprocal manufacturing agreement. RAI continues to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the Merger and the integration of the two companies\u2019 businesses. The expected net benefits associated with these costs may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.", "PERMNO": 86946, "SIC": 2111, "TIC": "RAI"}
