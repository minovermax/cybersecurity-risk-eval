RISK FACTORS\nThe Bank\u2019s growth strategy is driven by key factors while adhering to defined risk parameters. The key elements of the Bank\u2019s strategy reflect its prudent risk-taking philosophy. The Bank generates revenue by taking prudent and appropriately priced risks. These factors are outlined in the Bank\u2019s Risk Appetite Framework.\nThe Bank\u2019s Board of Directors has established a Risk Oversight Committee of the Board, approved an Enterprise Risk Management Framework, and appointed an Enterprise Risk Management Committee (\u201cERMC\u201d) to oversee and implement the Framework. The ERMC is comprised of senior management of the Bank and is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer. The Bank\u2019s most significant risk exposure has traditionally come from the acceptance of credit risk inherent in prudent extension of credit to relationship customers. In addition to credit risk, these committees also monitor the following level one risk areas: market and interest rate risk, liquidity risk, strategic, business and corporate governance risk, operational/technology risk, cyber risk, model risk, capital/financial reporting risk, legal/compliance risk (including regulatory risk), and reputational risk as outlined in the bank\u2019s risk taxonomy. Additional governance and oversight includes Board-approved policies and management committees with direct focus on these specific risk categories. Incorporated into each of these level one risks mentioned previously is third party vendor risk, which the Bank views as critical in the management and oversight of vendors.\nAlthough not comprehensive, the following describes several risk factors that are significant to the Bank:\nCredit Risk\nCredit quality has adversely affected us in the past and may adversely affect us in the future.\nCredit risk is one of our most significant risks. A decline in the strength of the U.S. economy in general or the local economies in which we conduct operations could result in, among other things, deterioration in credit quality and/or reduced demand for credit, including a resultant adverse effect on the income from our loan portfolio, an increase in charge-offs and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses (\u201cALLL\u201d).\nWe have concentrations of risk in our loan portfolio, including loans secured by real estate, leveraged and enterprise value lending, and oil and gas-related lending, which may have unique risk characteristics that may adversely affect our results.\nConcentration or counterparty risk could adversely affect the Bank. Concentration risk across our loan and investment portfolios could pose significant additional credit risk to the Bank due to exposures which perform in a similar fashion. Counterparty risk could also pose additional credit risk.\nWe engage in commercial construction and land acquisition and development lending, as well as commercial term lending, primarily in our western states footprint. The Bank, as a whole, has relatively larger concentrations of such lending than many other peer institutions. In addition, we have a concentration in oil and gas-related lending, primarily in Texas. Both commercial real estate (\u201cCRE\u201d) and oil and gas-related lending are subject to specific risks, including volatility and potential significant and prolonged declines in collateral-values and activity levels. In addition, our real estate lending is concentrated in the western states, and values there may behave differently than in other parts of the United States. We may have other unidentified concentrated or correlated risks in our loan portfolio.\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur business is highly correlated to local economic conditions in a specific geographic region of the United States.\nThe Bank provides a full range of banking and related services through its local management teams and unique brands in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. Approximately 79% and 78% of the Bank\u2019s total net interest income relates to our banking operations in Utah, Texas, and California for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. As a result of this geographic concentration, our financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas. Accordingly, adverse economic conditions affecting these three states in particular could significantly affect our consolidated operations and financial results. For example, our credit risk could be elevated to the extent that our lending practices in these three states focus on borrowers or groups of borrowers with similar economic characteristics, which are similarly affected by the same adverse economic events. At December 31, 2018, loan balances associated with our banking operations in Utah, Texas, and California comprised 79% of the Bank\u2019s commercial lending portfolio, 73% of the CRE lending portfolio, and 69% of the consumer lending portfolio.\nWe have been and could continue to be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions.\nAdverse economic conditions negatively affect the Bank\u2019s assets, including its loan and securities portfolios, capital levels, results of operations, and financial condition. The most recent financial crisis resulted in significant regulatory changes that continue to affect the Bank. Although economic conditions have improved since the most recent financial crisis, it is possible that economic conditions may weaken. Economic and fiscal conditions in the United States and other countries may directly or indirectly adversely impact economic and market conditions faced by the Bank and its customers. Any sustained weakness or further weakening in economic conditions would adversely affect the Bank.\nMarket and Interest Rate Risks\nFailure to effectively manage our interest rate risk and prolonged periods of low interest rates could adversely affect us.\nNet interest income is the largest component of the Bank\u2019s revenue. Interest rate risk is managed by the Asset Liability Management Committee, which is established by the Bank\u2019s Board of Directors. Failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk could adversely affect the Bank. Factors beyond the Bank\u2019s control can significantly influence the interest rate environment and increase the Bank\u2019s risk. These factors include competitive pricing pressures for our loans and deposits, adverse shifts in the mix of deposits and other funding sources, and volatile market interest rates resulting from general economic conditions and the policies of governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular the FRB.\nOver the course of the last year, we have maintained a moderate level of asset-sensitivity as the market rates seemed more likely to increase than to decrease. As risks shifted at the end of the year to be more balanced between higher or lower rates in the future, the Asset/Liability Committee (\u201cALCO\u201d) has undertaken strategies to reduce the level of asset-sensitivity, such as entering into rate floor agreements and increasing the use of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges to synthetically convert floating-rate assets to fixed-rate. We anticipate moving towards a less asset-sensitive interest rate risk position over the course of 2019.\nInterest rates on the Bank\u2019s financial instruments might be subject to change based on developments related to LIBOR, which could adversely impact the Bank\u2019s revenue, expenses, and value of those financial instruments.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, the authority regulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), along with various other regulatory bodies, announced that LIBOR would likely be discontinued at the end of 2021. LIBOR makes up the most liquid and common interest rate index in the world and is commonly referenced in financial instruments. We have exposure to LIBOR in various aspects through our financial contracts. Instruments that may be impacted include loans, securities, and derivatives, among other financial contracts indexed to LIBOR and that mature after December 31, 2021.\nWhile there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of U.S. financial market participants, selected by the\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, started in May 2018 to publish the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as an alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by Treasury securities that was selected by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee due to the depth and robustness of the U.S. Treasury repurchase market. At this time, it is impossible to predict whether SOFR will become an accepted alternative to LIBOR.\nThe market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, such as SOFR, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, any such transition could:\n\u2022\nadversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, the revenue and expenses associate with, and the value of our floating-rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u2022\nprompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate;\n\u2022\nresult in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based securities; and\n\u2022\nrequire the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark, such as SOFR.\nThe manner and impact of this transition, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan and investment and trading securities portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain.\nLiquidity Risk\nAs a regulated entity, we are subject to capital and liquidity requirements that may limit our operations and potential growth.\nThe Bank is subject to the comprehensive, consolidated supervision and regulation of the OCC and the FDIC, including risk-based and leverage capital ratio requirements, and Basel III liquidity requirements. Capital needs may rise above normal levels when we experience deteriorating earnings and credit quality, and our banking regulators may increase our capital requirements based on general economic conditions and our particular condition, risk profile and growth plans. Compliance with the capital requirements, including leverage ratios, may limit operations that require the intensive use of capital and could adversely affect our ability to expand or maintain present business levels. Although the Bank is not currently subject to the Final LCR Rule or the net stable funding ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d), it is possible that the Bank may become subject to a liquid coverage ratio requirement or other heightened liquidity requirements in the future if the OCC or another banking regulator apply such a requirement to the Bank as a supervisory matter. In addition, the Bank may become subject to any rule implementing the NSFR that is promulgated in the future. As a result, the Bank could be required to hold a higher portion of its assets in securities and other liquid assets and a lower portion of its assets in loans. Securities and other liquid assets generally have lower yields than loans of the type made by the Bank. For a summary of the capital rules to which we are subject, see \u201cCapital Standards - Basel Framework\u201d on page 9 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe and/or the holders of our securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable rating actions from rating agencies.\nOur ability to access the capital markets is important to our overall funding profile. This access is affected by the ratings assigned by rating agencies to us and particular classes of securities that we issue. The rates that we pay on our securities are also influenced by, among other things, the credit ratings that we and/or our securities receive from recognized rating agencies. Ratings downgrades to us or our securities could increase our costs or otherwise have a negative effect on our results of operations or financial condition or the market prices of our securities.\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nStrategic, Business and Corporate Governance Risks\nProblems encountered by other financial institutions could adversely affect financial markets generally and have indirect adverse effects on us.\nThe commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships between the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as \u201csystemic risk\u201d and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges, with which we interact on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect us. Information security and vendor management processes are in place to actively identify, manage and monitor actual and potential impacts.\nThe regulation of incentive compensation under the Dodd-Frank Act may adversely affect our ability to retain our highest performing employees.\nThe bank regulatory agencies have published guidance and proposed regulations which limit the manner and amount of compensation that banking organizations provide to employees. These regulations and guidance may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel. If we were to suffer such adverse effects with respect to our employees, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially.\nWe have made, and are continuing to make, significant changes to the Bank that include, among other things, organizational restructurings, efficiency initiatives, and replacement or upgrades of certain core technological systems to improve our control environment, and operating efficiency. The ultimate success and completion of these changes, and their effect on the Bank, may vary significantly from initial planning, which could materially adversely affect the Bank.\nOver the last several years, the Bank has completed numerous improvement projects, including the merger of its bank holding company into the Bank, combining the legal charters of our seven affiliate banks into one, consolidating 15 loan operations sites into two, upgrading our accounting systems, installing a credit origination work flow system, streamlining our small business and retail lending, mortgage, wealth management and foreign exchange businesses, and investing in data quality and information security. Ongoing investment continues in a multi-year project to replace our core loan and deposit systems, a collection of customer-facing digital capabilities and a variety of other projects to simplify how we do business.\nThese changes continue to be implemented; some of the projects are fully completed, and some projects are in their early stages. By their very nature, projections of duration, cost, expected savings, expected efficiencies, and related items are subject to change and significant variability.\nWe may encounter significant adverse developments in the completion and implementation of these changes. These may include significant time delays, cost overruns, loss of key people, technological problems, processing failures, and other adverse developments. Any or all of these issues could result in disruptions to our systems, processes, control environment, procedures, and employees, which may adversely impact our customers and our ability to conduct business.\nWe have plans, policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the negative effect of these potential adverse developments. However, there can be no assurance that any such adverse developments will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately remediated. The ultimate effect of any adverse development could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could materially affect the Bank, including its control environment, operating efficiency, and results of operations.\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOperational/Technology Risks\nCatastrophic events including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, floods, and prolonged drought, may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets, specific industries, and the Bank.\nThe Bank has significant operations and a significant customer base in Utah, Texas, California and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, floods, and prolonged drought. These types of natural catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy, the Bank\u2019s business and customers, and have posed physical risks to the Bank\u2019s property. In addition, catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on the Bank\u2019s customers and in turn on the Bank. Although we have business continuity and disaster recovery programs in place, a significant catastrophic event could materially adversely affect the Bank\u2019s operating results.\nWe could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls.\nA failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings, but also on the perception that customers, regulators and investors may have of the Bank. We continue to devote a significant amount of effort, time and resources to improving our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and regulations. These efforts also include the management of controls to mitigate operational risks for programs and processes across the Bank.\nWe could be adversely affected by financial technology advancements and other non-traditional lending and banking sources.\nThe ability to successfully remain competitive is dependent upon our ability to maintain a critical technological capability and to identify and develop new, value-added products for existing and future customers. Failure to do so could impede our time to market, reduce customer product accessibility, and weaken our competitive position.\nCyber Risk\nWe are subject to a variety of system failure and cyber security risks that could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. We, our customers, and other financial institutions with which we interact, are subject to ongoing, continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers, organized criminals, and in some cases, state-sponsored organizations. Information security risks for large financial institutions such as the Bank have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as Internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external third parties. Third parties with whom we or our customers do business also present operational and information security risks to us, including security breaches or failures of their own systems. The possibility of employee error, failure to follow security procedures, or malfeasance also presents these risks. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal computers, smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control environment. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of our information systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems, misappropriation of funds, and theft, disclosure or misuse of proprietary Bank or customer data. While we have significant internal resources, policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed.\nAs cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate or remediate any information security vulnerabilities. System enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems, the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. In\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\naddition, addressing certain information security vulnerabilities, such as hardware-based vulnerabilities, may affect the performance of our information technology systems. The ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks, particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors. The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nModel Risk\nWe use models in the management of the Bank. There is risk that these models are incorrect or inaccurate in various ways, which can cause us to make non-optimal decisions, and this risk causes the Bank to hold additional capital as a buffer against that risk.\nWe attempt to carefully develop, document, back test, and validate the models used in the management of the Bank, including, for example, models used in the management of interest rate and liquidity risk, and those used in projecting stress losses in various segments of our credit and securities portfolios, and projecting net revenue under stress. Models are inherently imperfect for a number of reasons, however, and cannot perfectly predict outcomes. Management decisions based in part on such models, therefore, can be suboptimal. In addition, in determining the Bank\u2019s capital needs under stress testing, we attempt to specifically quantify the amounts by which model results could be incorrect, and we hold material additional amounts of capital as a buffer against this \u201cmodel risk.\u201d\nCapital/Financial Reporting Risks\nInternal stress testing and capital management, as well as provisions of the National Bank Act and OCC regulations, may limit our ability to increase dividends, repurchase shares of our stock, and access the capital markets.\nAlthough we are no longer subject to the CCAR regime, we are required to submit stress tests to the OCC because the Bank has assets in excess of $10 billion, and we expect to continue to utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital, based upon actual and hypothetically-stressed economic conditions. The stress testing and other applicable regulatory requirements may, among other things, require us to increase our capital levels, limit our dividends or other capital distributions to shareholders, modify our business strategies, or decrease our exposure to various asset classes.\nUnder the National Bank Act and OCC regulations, certain capital transaction may be subject to the approval of the OCC. These requirements may limit our ability to respond to and take advantage of market developments.\nEconomic and other circumstances may require us to raise capital at times or in amounts that are unfavorable to the Bank.\nThe Bank must maintain certain risk-based and leverage capital ratios, as required by its banking regulators, which can change depending upon general economic conditions, and the particular conditions, risk profiles and growth plans of the Bank. Compliance with capital requirements may limit the Bank\u2019s ability to expand and has required, and may require, the Bank or its subsidiaries to raise additional capital. These uncertainties and risks, including those created by legislative and regulatory uncertainties, may increase the Bank\u2019s cost of capital and other financing costs.\nWe could be adversely affected by accounting, financial reporting, and regulatory/compliance risk.\nThe Bank is exposed to accounting, financial reporting, and regulatory/compliance risk. The Bank provides to its customers, invests in, and uses for its own capital, funding, and risk management needs, a number of complex financial products and services. Estimates, judgments, and interpretations of complex and changing accounting and regulatory policies are required in order to provide and account for these products and services. Changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and conditions. The level of regulatory/compliance oversight has been heightened in recent periods as a result of rapid changes in regulations that affect financial institutions. The administration of some of these regulations and related changes has required the Bank to comply before their formal adoption. Therefore, identification, interpretation and\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nimplementation of complex and changing accounting standards as well as compliance with regulatory requirements pose an ongoing risk.\nThe value of our goodwill may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Bank had $1 billion of goodwill that was allocated to Amegy Bank (\u201cAmegy\u201d), California Bank & Trust (\u201cCB&T\u201d) and Zions Bank. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than its carrying value, the Bank may have to take a charge related to the impairment of its goodwill. Such a charge would occur if the Bank were to experience increases in the book value of a reporting unit in excess of the increase in the fair value of equity of a reporting unit. A significant decline in the Bank\u2019s expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower economic growth or a significant and sustained decline in the price of the Bank\u2019s common stock, any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of the risk factors discussed herein, may necessitate the Bank taking charges in the future related to the impairment of its goodwill. Future regulatory actions could also have a material impact on assessments of the appropriateness of the goodwill carrying value. If the Bank was to conclude in the future that a write-down of its goodwill is necessary, it would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Bank may not be able to utilize the significant DTA recorded on its balance sheet.\nThe Bank\u2019s balance sheet includes a significant DTA. We had net DTAs of $130 million at December 31, 2018, compared with $93 million at December 31, 2017. The largest component of this asset results from additions to our ALLL for purposes of GAAP in excess of loan losses actually taken for tax purposes. Our ability to continue to record this DTA is dependent on the Bank\u2019s ability to realize its value through net operating loss carrybacks or future projected earnings. Loss of part or all of this asset would adversely impact tangible capital. In addition, inclusion of this asset in determining regulatory capital is subject to certain limitations. Currently, no DTAs are disallowed for regulatory purposes at the Bank.\nLegal Risks\nThe Dodd-Frank Act imposes significant limitations on our business activities and subjects us to increased regulation and additional costs.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act implementing regulations place significant additional regulatory oversight and requirements on financial institutions. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act:\n\u2022\nimpacts the Bank\u2019s ability to invest in certain types of entities or engage in certain activities;\n\u2022\nimpacts a number of the Bank\u2019s business strategies;\n\u2022\nrequires us to incur the cost of developing substantial heightened risk management policies and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nregulates the pricing of certain of our products and services and restricts the revenue that the Bank generates from certain businesses;\n\u2022\nsubjects the Bank to supervision by the CFPB, with very broad rule-making and enforcement authorities;\n\u2022\ngrants authority to state agencies to enforce state and federal laws against national banks; and\n\u2022\nsubjects the Bank to new and different litigation and regulatory enforcement risks;\nThe Bank and the entire financial services industry have incurred and will continue to incur substantial personnel, systems, consulting, and other costs in order to comply with regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act. Some aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act continue to be subject to rulemaking, many of the rules that have been adopted will take effect over several additional years, and many of the rules that have been adopted may be subject to interpretation and clarification, and accordingly, the impact of such regulatory changes cannot be presently determined. Individually and collectively, regulations adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act may materially adversely affect the Bank\u2019s and the financial services industry\u2019s business, financial condition (including the Bank\u2019s ability to compete effectively with less regulated financial services providers), and results of operations.\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOther legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may have a significant adverse effect on our operations and earnings.\nIn addition to the Dodd-Frank Act described previously, bank regulatory agencies and international regulatory consultative bodies have proposed or are considering new regulations and requirements, some of which may be imposed without formal promulgation. Our deposits are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, we are subject to FDIC insurance assessments.\nThere can be no assurance that any or all of these regulatory changes or actions will ultimately be adopted. However, if adopted, some of these proposals could adversely affect the Bank by, among other things: impacting after-tax returns earned by financial services firms in general; limiting the Bank\u2019s ability to grow; increasing taxes or fees on some of the Bank\u2019s funding or activities; limiting the range of products and services that the Bank could offer; and requiring the Bank to raise capital at inopportune times.\nRecent political developments could result in substantial changes in tax, international trade, immigration, and other policies. The extent and timing of any such changes are uncertain, as are the potential direct and indirect impacts, whether beneficial or adverse. Regulations and laws may be modified or repealed, and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us and our subsidiaries.\nThe ultimate impact of these proposals cannot be predicted as it is unclear which, if any, may be adopted.\nWe could be adversely affected by legal and governmental proceedings.\nWe are subject to risks associated with legal claims, litigation, and regulatory and other government proceedings. The Bank\u2019s exposure to these proceedings has increased and may further increase as a result of stresses on customers, counterparties and others arising from the past or current economic environments, new regulations promulgated under recently adopted statutes, the creation of new examination and enforcement bodies, and increasingly aggressive enforcement and legal actions against banking organizations. Any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our results of operations, financial condition or ability to conduct our business, including adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties (including civil money penalties under applicable banking laws), injunctions, restrictions on our business activities or other relief. Our involvement in any such matters, even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor, could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business. In general, the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations, including those relating to anti-money laundering matters, have been increasing dramatically. In addition, any enforcement matters could impact our supervisory and CRA ratings, which may restrict or limit our activities.\nThe corporate and securities laws applicable to the Bank are not as well-developed as those applicable to a state-chartered corporation, and this may impact the ability of the Bank to effect corporate transactions in an efficient and optimal manner.\nPrior to the restructuring, the corporate affairs of the Bank\u2019s holding company were governed by Utah state law, and securities law matters were governed by the federal securities laws, including the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as administered by the SEC. Each of these legal regimes is well-developed and used widely by public companies.\nPost-restructuring, the Bank\u2019s corporate affairs are governed by the National Bank Act and related regulations administered by the OCC. With respect to securities matters, the Bank is not subject to the Securities Act, but rather to OCC regulations governing securities offerings. The Bank\u2019s common stock and certain other securities are registered or deemed registered under the Exchange Act, which vests the OCC with the power to administer and enforce certain sections of the Exchange Act applicable to banks such as the Bank (though the Bank currently makes and intends to continue to make filings required by the Exchange Act with the SEC as a \u201cvoluntary filer\u201d). These OCC statutory and regulatory regimes have been used by publicly-traded banking organizations relatively rarely and are not as well-developed as the corporate and securities law regimes applicable to corporations. While certain specific risks associated with operating under these regimes are discussed below, unless and until these regimes are further developed and established over time, the uncertainty of how these regimes might apply to any\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\ngiven corporate or securities matters may prevent us from effecting transactions in an efficient and optimal manner or perhaps at all.\nDifferences between the National Bank Act and state law requirements in respect of mergers could result in the Bank not being able to execute acquisitions as efficiently and advantageously as bank holding companies or other financial institutions.\nUnlike state corporate law, the National Bank Act requires shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and does not allow for exceptions in the case of various \u201cminor\u201d mergers, such as a parent company\u2019s merger with a subsidiary or an acquirer\u2019s merger with an unaffiliated entity in which the shares issued by the acquirer do not exceed a designated percentage. The National Bank Act and related regulations do not allow for the direct merger into a national bank of a non-affiliated non-bank.\nThese differences could adversely affect the Bank\u2019s, and other banks registered under the National Bank Act, ability to efficiently consummate acquisition transactions. In addition, such differences could make the Bank less competitive as a potential acquirer in certain circumstances given that the Bank\u2019s acquisition proposal may be conditioned on Bank shareholder approval while the Bank\u2019s competitors\u2019 proposals will not have such a condition.\nDifferences between the National Bank Act and state law could result in the Bank\u2019s capacity to pay dividends and repurchase shares at any given time being different from the capacity that existed for Zions Bancorporation prior to the restructuring.\nThe regulations and limitations applicable to the Bank relating to the payment of dividends and repurchases or redemptions of outstanding common and preferred shares differ from the limitations and considerations that applied to the Bank\u2019s holding company prior to the recent restructuring. While the Bank does not believe this change in legal restrictions resulting from the restructuring will constrain the Bank from executing any capital plans that are currently contemplated or otherwise reasonably foreseeable in the near term, there can be no assurance that the change in legal restrictions will not have an adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends and repurchase or redeem stock in the future.\nShares of common stock of a national bank are assessable and this may cause investors to view the Bank\u2019s common stock less favorably than that of Zions Bancorporation prior to the restructuring.\nThe National Bank Act provides that under certain circumstances the common stock of a national bank is assessable, i.e., holders may be subject to a levy for more funds if so determined by the OCC. In contrast, the common stock of state corporations is not subject to assessment. However, the OCC has confirmed that under the applicable provisions of the National Bank Act, assessability is limited to the par value of a national bank\u2019s stock. The Bank\u2019s common stock has a par value of $0.001. Moreover, according to the OCC, it has not exercised its authority to levy assessments since 1933 and views the assessability authority as a mechanism for addressing capital deficiency that has long been overtaken by developments in statute and regulation, including robust capital standards, prompt corrective action requirements and supervisory and enforcement authorities requiring an institution to maintain capital at a particular level. Nonetheless, potential investors may be unfamiliar with the concept of assessment and, as a result, view the Bank less favorably as an investment.\nThe ability of investors to access financial and other reports filed by the Bank readily could be adversely affected if such reports were not able to be made available publicly through the SEC or a system operated by the OCC comparable to that of the SEC.\nThe Bank has been permitted and currently makes its Exchange Act filings as a \u201cvoluntary filer\u201d with the SEC. There can be no assurance, however, that the OCC or SEC will continue to allow the Bank to make filings as a voluntary filer or that the OCC will develop a comparable system for making Exchange Act filings publicly available. If the Bank\u2019s Exchange Act filings ceased to be as readily available as those of bank holding companies, investors could view the Bank less favorably.\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe Bank\u2019s ability to issue securities in an optimal manner may be adversely affected by the fact that the OCC\u2019s securities offering regulations and organizational structure are less well-developed than those of the SEC, which applied to the Bank\u2019s holding company prior to the restructuring.\nThe SEC maintains a well-developed regulatory regime and well-staffed organization relating to securities offerings under or exempt from the Securities Act. For example, the SEC has developed integrated disclosure rules, which allow Exchange Act filings to be incorporated by reference into prospectuses distributed as required by the Securities Act. In addition, under the SEC\u2019s rules seasoned issuers who are timely in their filings are permitted to use \u201cautomatic shelf registration,\u201d allowing them to offer securities under a registration statement that is automatically effective upon filing. The OCC maintains its own securities offering regime applicable to national banks and their securities offerings, which the Bank will need to comply with in order to access the public capital markets. Similar to the SEC\u2019s offering rules, the OCC\u2019s regime requires that registration statements be reviewed and declared or become effective. However, given that there are currently no other nationally-charted banks whose common stock has been issued under the OCC\u2019s securities offering regime, it is unknown at this point whether and how the OCC staff would review registration statements, and unclear whether the OCC would apply the same mechanics for automatic shelf registration filings used by SEC-filers, or how, more generally, the OCC will function as a securities regulator. Given the extent to and manner in which the Bank has accessed capital markets historically, or to which it currently contemplates accessing such markets, the Bank does not believe there will be a material adverse impact on the Bank\u2019s ability to access capital markets effectively, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case and it is possible that operating under the OCC\u2019s securities offering regime could impede the Bank\u2019s ability to sell securities at the most advantageous times or to achieve optimum pricing in offerings.\nThe Bank is subject to restrictions on permissible activities that would limit the types of business it may conduct and that may make acquisitions of other financial companies more challenging.\nUnder applicable laws and regulations, bank holding companies and banks are generally limited to business activities and investments that are related to banking or are financial in nature. The range of permissible financial activities is set forth in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and is more limited for banks than for bank holding company organizations. The differences relate mainly to insurance underwriting (but not insurance agency activities) and merchant banking (but not broker-dealer and investment advisory activities). Merchant banking authority is an important power for financial institutions that desire to engage in a full-scale investment banking business and can also be important for institutions that wish to engage in private equity and proprietary investment business lines. While historically the Bank\u2019s holding company did not seek to engage in activities available only to bank holding companies under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Bank is not able to engage in these activities. Loss of the bank holding company status resulting from the restructuring will make future acquisitions by the Bank of financial institutions that have such operations more challenging.\nThe Bank\u2019s common stock is not an insured deposit.\nShares of the Bank\u2019s common stock are not a bank deposit and, therefore, losses in value are not insured by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in shares of the Bank\u2019s common stock is inherently risky and is subject to the same market forces and investment risks that affect the price of common stock in any other company, including the possible loss of some or all principal invested.\nReputational Risk\nThe Bank is presented with various reputational risk issues that could stem from operational, regulatory/compliance and legal risks.\nA Reputational Risk Council was established to monitor, manage and develop strategies to effectively manage reputational risk which includes, but is not limited to, addressing communication logistics, legal and regulatory issues.\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES", "PERMNO": 84129, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "ZION"}
