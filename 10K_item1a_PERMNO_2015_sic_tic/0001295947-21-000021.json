RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nThe current pandemic from the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition, and the continuation of this pandemic, further outbreaks of COVID-19, or any future outbreak of other highly infectious diseases or public health emergencies could have a similar impact.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is causing significant volatility in the global economy and resulting in materially reduced economic activity since early 2020. Globally, numerous government orders and restrictions implemented to reduce the spread of COVID-19 since early calendar year 2020 have required many businesses to temporarily close or limit operations and have mandated that individuals substantially restrict daily activities, which has adversely affected workforces, customers, and consumer sentiment, decreased consumer spending and increased unemployment.\nOur operations are impacted by consumer spending levels, the availability of our products at retail stores or for online purchase, and our ability to manufacture and distribute products to our customers and consumers in an effective and efficient manner. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has not yet materially adversely impacted our business or our operations, we could experience a material adverse impact in future quarters if conditions worsen. For example, sales have varied throughout the year with some categories positively impacted (for instance, Women\u2019s Health, Oral Care and Dermatological) and some categories negatively impacted (for instance, Cough & Cold, and Gastrointestinal). We could experience adverse impacts from COVID-19 in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022supply chain delays or stoppages due to closed supplier facilities or distribution center, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;\n\u2022shutdown of our manufacturing facility due to illness or government order;\n\u2022reduced consumer demand for our products as a result of the economic downturn or restrictions on in-person purchases;\n\u2022change in demand for or availability of our products as a result of retailers or distributors modifying their restocking, fulfillment, or shipping practices;\n\u2022decrease in our ability to develop innovative products due to reprioritization of suppliers and/or retailers;\n\u2022increase in working capital needs and/or an increase in trade accounts receivable write-offs as a result of increased financial pressures on our suppliers or customers;\n\u2022impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or intangible assets or a change in the useful life of definite-lived intangible assets from sustained changes in consumer purchasing behaviors, government restrictions, or financial results;\n\u2022increase in raw material and other input costs resulting from market volatility; and\n\u2022fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates resulting from market uncertainties.\nOperationally in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we initiated a work remotely protocol and restricted the business travel of our workforce. Although we have not experienced a material impact to our business from these changes, if significant portions of our workforce, including key personnel, are unable to continue to work effectively because of illness, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic, the impact of the pandemic on our operations could be exacerbated. It was reported to us that there was an increase in absenteeism at our distribution center and some of our suppliers in the first and second quarters of calendar 2020. Despite the high absentee rate, however, we have not experienced a material disruption to our overall supply chain.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has not negatively impacted our results of operations to date, the extent to which it, and any related global economic downturn, could affect our business, results of operations and financial condition in future quarters will depend on developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the severity and duration of the outbreak and any recovery period, the availability and acceptance of vaccines, future actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic, and the impact on our customers, employees and suppliers, distributors and other service providers. In addition, our supply and distribution chains may be disrupted by supplier or dealer bankruptcies or permanent discontinuation of operations. Accordingly, the ultimate impact on our financial condition and results of operations cannot be determined at this time. Nonetheless, we anticipate that it could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including by negatively impacting the demand for our products, restricting our operations and sales, marketing and distribution efforts, disrupting supply chain and manufacturing processes and other important business activities. Moreover, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will exacerbate the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe high level of competition in our industry, much of which comes from competitors with greater resources, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe business of selling brand name consumer products in the OTC Healthcare market is highly competitive. This market includes numerous manufacturers, distributors, marketers and retailers that actively compete for consumers\u2019 business both in the United States and abroad. Many of these competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do, and may therefore have the ability to spend more aggressively on research and development and advertising and marketing, and to respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions, including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. If this were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our product lines that account for a large percentage of our sales have a smaller market share relative to our competitors. In some cases, we may have a number one market position but still have a relatively small share of the overall market. Alternatively, we may hold a number two market position but have a substantially smaller share of the market versus the number one competitor. See \u201cPart I, Item 1. Business - Major Brands\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding market share.\nWe compete for consumers\u2019 attention based on a number of factors, including brand recognition, product quality, performance, value to consumers, price and product availability at the retail level. Advertising, marketing, merchandising and packaging and the timing of new product introductions and line extensions also have a significant impact on consumer buying decisions and, as a result, on our sales. Our markets are highly sensitive to the introduction of new products, which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market. New product innovations by our competitors, or our failure to develop new products, the failure of a new product launch by the Company, or the obsolescence of one or more of our products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our advertising, marketing and promotional programs are not effective, our sales may decline. In addition, the introduction or expansion of store brand products that compete with our products has impacted and could in the future impact our sales and results of operations.\nThe structure and quality of our sales force, as well as sell-through of our products, affect in-store and our e-commerce product position, wall display space and inventory levels for retail sale. If we are unable to maintain our current distribution network, product offerings for retail sale, inventory levels and in-store and online positioning of our products, our sales and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by us. Competitive pricing may require us to reduce prices, which may result in lost revenue or a reduction of our profit margins. Future price adjustments by our competitors or our inability to react with price adjustments of our own could result in a loss of market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers with whom we have no long-term agreements for a large portion of our gross sales, and the loss of one or more of these customers or changes in their strategies and policies could reduce our gross sales and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring 2021, Walmart, which accounted for approximately 21.6% of our gross sales, was our only customer that accounted for more than 10% of our gross revenues. We expect that for future periods, our top ten customers, including Walmart, will, in the aggregate, continue to account for a large and potentially increasing portion of our sales. Many of our customers have sought to obtain lower pricing, special packaging inventory practices, logistics or other changes to the customer-supplier relationship. If we are unable to effectively respond to the demands of our customers, these customers could reduce their purchases of our products and increase their purchases of products from competitors. Reductions in inventory by our customers, the loss of one or more of our top customers, including as a result of consolidation in the retail industry, or any significant decrease in sales to these customers based on changes in their strategies or policies including a reduction in the number of brands they carry, the amount of shelf space or positioning they dedicate to store brand products, inventory management, or a significant decrease in our retail display space or online positioning or in any of these customers\u2019 stores, could reduce our sales and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our business is based primarily upon individual sales orders. We typically do not enter into long-term contracts with our customers. Accordingly, our customers could cease buying products or reduce the number of items they buy from us at any time and for any reason. The fact that we do not have long-term contracts with our customers means that we have no recourse in the event a customer no longer wants to purchase products from us or reduces the number of items purchased. If a significant number of our smaller customers, or any of our significant customers, elect not to purchase products from us, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe primarily depend on third-party manufacturers to produce the products we sell. If we are unable to maintain these manufacturing relationships or are unable to successfully transfer manufacturing to another third-party or our own manufacturing facility we may be unable to meet customer demand and our business, sales and profitability could suffer as a result.\nMany of our products are produced by a limited number of third-party manufacturers. Our ability to retain our current manufacturing relationships and engage in and successfully transition to new relationships or to our own manufacturing facility is critical to our ability to deliver quality products to our customers in a timely manner. Without adequate supplies of quality merchandise, our sales would decrease materially and our business would suffer. In the event that our primary third-party manufacturers are unable or unwilling to ship products to us in a timely manner, we would have to rely on secondary manufacturing relationships or, to the extent unavailable, identify and qualify new manufacturing relationships. Because of the unique manufacturing requirements of certain products, the Company may be unable to timely qualify new suppliers or at the quantities, quality and price levels needed. From time to time, certain of the Company's manufacturers have had difficulty meeting demand, which can cause shortages of our products. In such instances, we may not be able to identify or qualify secondary manufacturers for such products in a timely manner, and such manufacturers may not allocate sufficient capacity to allow us to meet our commitments to customers. In addition, identifying alternative manufacturers without adequate lead times may involve additional manufacturing expense, delay in production, or product disadvantage in the marketplace. In some instances, we may seek to transfer the manufacturing of certain products to our own facilities which may result in additional manufacturing expense, delay in production, additional regulatory requirements and other disruptions to our business. In general, the consequences of not securing adequate, high quality and timely supplies of merchandise would negatively impact inventory levels, which could damage our reputation and result in lost customers and sales, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe manufacturers we use have historically and may continue to increase the cost of many of the products we purchase, which could adversely affect our margins in the event we are unable to pass along these increased costs to our customers or identify and qualify new manufacturers. Increased costs could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAt March 31, 2021, we had relationships with 118 third-party manufacturers. Of those, we had long-term contracts with 19 manufacturers that produced items that accounted for approximately 70.5% of our gross sales for 2021, compared to 14 manufacturers with long-term contracts that produced approximately 62.3% of gross sales in 2020. The fact that we do not have long-term contracts with certain manufacturers means that they could cease manufacturing our products at any time and for any reason or initiate arbitrary and costly price increases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Although we are in the process of negotiating long-term contracts with certain key manufacturers, we may not be able to reach a timely agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nPrice increases for raw materials, labor, energy, transportation costs and other manufacturer, logistics provider or distributor demands could have an adverse impact on our margins.\nThe costs to manufacture and distribute our products are subject to fluctuation based on a variety of factors. Increases in commodity raw material (including resins), packaging component prices, and labor, energy and fuel costs and other input costs could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations if our raw material suppliers, third-party manufacturers, logistics providers or distributors pass along those costs to us. If we are unable to increase the price for our products to our customers or continue to achieve cost savings in a rising cost environment, any such cost increases would likely reduce our gross margins and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If we increase the price of our products in order to maintain our current gross margins for our products, such increase may adversely affect demand for, and sales of, our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruption in our third-party distribution center or our Virginia manufacturing facility may prevent us from meeting customer demand, and our sales and profitability may suffer as a result.\nIn 2020, we moved our product distribution in the United States to be managed by a third-party through one primary distribution center in Clayton, Indiana, and with the acquisition of Fleet, we operate one manufacturing facility located in Lynchburg, Virginia, which manufactures products comprising approximately 16% of our gross revenues. A natural disaster, such as tornado, earthquake, flood, or fire, could damage our inventory and/or materially impair our ability to distribute our products to customers in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost. In addition, a serious disruption caused by performance or\ncontractual issues with a third-party distribution manager or contagious disease outbreaks or other public health emergencies could also materially impact our product distribution. For example, we previously identified the COVID-19 pandemic or another outbreak could materially impair our distribution network if our distribution facilities were required to close or limit operations due to illness or government order. Any disruption as a result of business integration, contagious disease outbreaks, or third-party performance at our distribution center could result in increased costs, expense and/or shipping times, and could cause us to incur customer fees and penalties. In addition, any serious disruption to our Lynchburg manufacturing facility could materially impair our ability to manufacture many of the Summer's Eve and Fleet products, which would also limit our ability to provide those products to customers in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost. We could also incur significantly higher costs and experience longer lead times should we be required to replace our distribution center, the third-party distribution managers or the manufacturing facility. As a result, any serious disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsumption trends for our products may not correlate to our results of operations.\nWe regularly review consumption levels for our core brands to provide an indication of the strength of our expected results of operations. Total company consumption is based on domestic IRI multi-outlet + C-Store retail sales for the relevant period, retail sales from other third parties for certain untracked e-commerce channels in North America for leading retailers, Australia consumption based on IMS data, and other international net revenues as a proxy for consumption. Our calculation of consumption levels may not accurately reflect actual retail consumption, given the limitations of the tracked data primarily with respect to e-commerce, Costco and international sales. In addition, many retailers have implemented inventory management strategies that include reductions in the amount of inventory they carry and related reductions in retail space and we would expect those efforts to continue.\nProduct liability claims and product recalls and related negative publicity could adversely affect our sales and operating results.\nWe are dependent on consumers\u2019 perception of the safety and quality of our products. Negative consumer perception may arise from product liability claims and product recalls, regardless of whether such claims or recalls involve us or our products. The mere publication of information asserting concerns about the safety of our products or the ingredients used in our products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For example, some of our products contain the active ingredient acetaminophen, which is a pain reliever and fever reducer. We believe our products are safe and effective when used in accordance with label directions. However, adverse publicity about acetaminophen or other ingredients used in our products may discourage consumers from buying our products containing those ingredients, which would have an adverse impact on our sales.\nFrom time to time we are subjected to various product liability claims. Claims could be based on allegations that, among other things, our products contain contaminants, include inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use or include inadequate warnings concerning side effects and interactions with other substances. Whether or not successful, product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and our business, sales and operating results. Additionally, we may be required to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by our products. In addition, we could be required for a variety of reasons to initiate product recalls, which we have done on several occasions. Any product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we have supply and manufacturing agreements with certain of our third-party manufacturers, which explicitly outline the allocation of product liability risk with respect to the products these manufacturers produce, some of our other products are manufactured on a purchase order basis. To the extent we rely on purchase orders to govern our commercial relationships with suppliers, we have not specifically negotiated the allocation of risk for product liability obligations. Instead, we typically rely on implied warranties from the suppliers with respect to these products. As a result, we may have difficulty enforcing these implied warranties, and we may bear all or a significant portion of any product liability obligations rather than transferring this risk to our third-party manufacturers.\nIn addition, although we maintain, and require our suppliers and third-party manufacturers to maintain, product liability insurance coverage, potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, in the future we may not be able to obtain adequate product liability insurance coverage or we may be required to pay higher premiums and accept higher deductibles in order to secure adequate product liability insurance coverage.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions and Product Development\nOur inability to successfully identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisition candidates and to obtain necessary financing could have an adverse impact on our growth and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAchievement of our strategic objectives includes the acquisition, or potentially the disposition, of certain brands or product lines, and these acquisitions and dispositions may not be successful.\nThe majority of our historical growth has been driven by acquiring other brands and companies. At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions that are intended to enhance our product portfolio, enable us to realize cost savings, and further diversify our category, customer and channel focus. Our ability to successfully grow through acquisitions depends on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisition candidates and to obtain any necessary financing. However, we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic acquisitions at attractive valuations, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, or otherwise complete future acquisitions. All acquisitions entail various risks such that after completing an acquisition, we may also experience:\n\u2022Difficulties in integrating any acquired companies, suppliers, personnel and products into our existing business;\n\u2022Difficulties in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products, including expected returns, margins, synergies and profitability;\n\u2022Higher costs of integration than we anticipated;\n\u2022Exposure to unexpected liabilities of the acquired business;\n\u2022Difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to operate the business;\n\u2022Difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies throughout our acquired companies; or\n\u2022Adverse customer or stockholder reaction to the acquisition.\nAs a result, any acquisitions we pursue or complete could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results from operations. In addition, any acquisition could adversely affect our operating results as a result of higher interest costs from any acquisition-related debt and higher amortization expenses related to the acquired intangible assets.\nIn the event that we decide to divest of a brand or product line, we may encounter difficulty finding, or be unable to find, a buyer on acceptable terms in a timely manner.\nAdditionally, the pursuit of acquisitions and divestitures could also divert management's attention from our business operations and result in a delay in our efforts to achieve our strategic objectives.\nIf new products and product line extensions do not gain widespread customer acceptance or are otherwise discontinued, the Company's financial performance could be impacted.\nThe Company's future performance and growth depends on its ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product line extensions. We cannot be certain that we will achieve our innovation goals. The successful development and introduction of new products involves substantial research, development, marketing and promotional expenditures, which the Company may be unable to recover if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance. New product development and marketing efforts, including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the Company has limited or no prior experience, have inherent risks. These risks include product development or launch delays, competitor actions, regulatory approval hurdles and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance.\nRegulatory Risks\nOur risks associated with doing business internationally increase as we expand our international footprint.\nDuring 2021, 2020, and 2019, approximately 10.0%, 10.8% and 9.6%, respectively, of our total revenues were attributable to our international business. We generally rely on brokers and distributors for the sale of our products in foreign countries. In addition, some of our third-party manufacturers are located outside the United States. Risks of doing business internationally include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022Political instability or declining economic conditions in the countries or regions where we operate that adversely affect sales of our products;\n\u2022Currency controls that restrict or prohibit the payment of funds or the repatriation of earnings to the United States;\n\u2022Fluctuating foreign exchange rates that result in unfavorable increases in the price of our products or cause increases in the cost of certain products purchased from our foreign third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022Compliance with laws and regulations concerning ethical business practices;\n\u2022Trade restrictions and exchange controls;\n\u2022Difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022Difficulty protecting our intellectual property rights in these markets; and\n\u2022Increased costs of compliance with general business and tax regulations in these countries or regions.\nAs our operations grow internationally, we become increasingly dependent on foreign distributors and sales agents for compliance and adherence to foreign laws and regulations that we may not be familiar with, and we cannot be certain that these distributors and sales agents will adhere to such laws and regulations or adhere to our business practices and policies. Any violation of laws and regulations by foreign distributors or sales agents or a failure of foreign distributors or sales agents to comply with applicable business practices and policies could result in legal or regulatory sanctions or potentially damage our reputation. If we fail to manage these risks effectively, we may not be able to grow our international operations, and our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, the United Kingdom's (the \u201cUK\u201d) exit from the European Union (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) could disrupt trade and the free movement of goods, services and people between the UK and the European Union. Our operations in the UK represent less than 1% of our total revenues. The restrictions on trade created by Brexit could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nRegulatory matters governing our industry could have a significant negative effect on our sales and operating costs.\nIn both the United States and in our foreign markets, our operations are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions and similar constraints. Such laws, regulations and other constraints exist at the federal, state and local levels in the United States and at analogous levels of government in foreign jurisdictions.\nThe formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, marketing, sale and storage of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various U.S. federal agencies, including the FDA, FTC and CPSC, the EPA, and by various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which our products are manufactured, distributed, stored and sold. The FDC Act and FDA regulations require that the manufacturing processes of our facilities and third-party manufacturers of U.S. products must also comply with the FDA\u2019s GMPs. The FDA inspects our facilities and those of our third-party manufacturers periodically to determine if we and our third-party manufacturers are complying with GMPs. The health regulatory bodies of other countries have their own regulations and standards, which may or may not be consistent with the U.S. FDA GMPs. In addition, our and our suppliers\u2019 operations are subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and some suppliers by the National Labor Relations Board. Our activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which our products and their constituent materials and components are manufactured and sold. If we wish to begin manufacture of different products in our facility, we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to part or all of our operations. A history of general compliance in the past is not a guarantee that future regulations will not mandate other compliance steps and associated expense.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturers or distributors fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could become subject to enforcement actions, significant penalties or claims, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we could be required to:\n\u2022Suspend manufacturing operations;\n\u2022Modify product formulations or processes;\n\u2022Suspend the sale or require a recall of non-compliant products; or\n\u2022Change product labeling, packaging, distribution, storage, marketing, or advertising, or take other corrective action.\nThe adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or the cessation of product sales and may adversely affect the marketing of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our failure to comply with FDA, FTC, EPA or any other federal and state regulations, or with similar regulations in foreign markets, that cover our product registration, product claims and advertising, including direct claims and advertising by us, may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties, litigation by private parties, or otherwise materially adversely affect the distribution and sale of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to increasing focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) issues, including those related to climate change.\nAs climate change, land use, water use, deforestation, recyclability or recoverability of packaging, plastic waste, ingredients and other ESG and sustainability concerns become more prevalent, federal, state and local governments, non-governmental organizations and our customers, consumers and investors are increasingly sensitive to these issues. This increased focus on sustainability may result in new laws, regulations and requirements that could cause disruptions in or increased costs associated with developing, manufacturing and distributing our products. We could also lose revenue if our consumers change brands, our customers refuse to buy our products, or investors choose not to invest in our common stock if we do not meet their ESG and sustainability expectations. For example, during 2020, some of our major customers requested we respond to various questionnaires to evaluate our ESG efforts. Efforts to meet these standards could impact our costs, and failure to meet our customers\u2019 expectations could impact our sales and business reputation. While we strive to minimize the environmental impact of our global operations, we may experience reduced demand for our products and loss of customers if we do not meet their ESG expectations, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Data Privacy and Security\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our ability to compete effectively in the market for our products could be negatively impacted.\nThe market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the goodwill associated with our trademarks, tradenames and patents. Our trademarks and tradenames convey that the products we sell are \u201cbrand name\u201d products. We believe consumers ascribe value to our brands, some of which are over 100 years old. We own or license the material trademarks, tradenames and patents used in connection with the packaging, marketing and sale of our products. These rights prevent our competitors or new entrants to the market from using our valuable brand names and technologies. Therefore, trademark, tradename and patent protection is critical to our business. Although most of our material intellectual property is registered in the United States and in applicable foreign countries, we may not be successful in asserting protection. If we were to lose the exclusive right to use one or more of our intellectual property rights, the loss of such exclusive right could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, other parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our brands in the marketplace. Brand dilution could cause confusion in the marketplace and adversely affect the value that consumers associate with our brands, which could negatively impact our business and sales. In addition, third parties may assert claims against our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to successfully resolve those claims, which would cause us to lose the right to use the intellectual property subject to those claims. Such loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, from time to time, we may be involved in litigation in which we are enforcing or\ndefending our intellectual property rights, which could require us to incur substantial fees and expenses and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on third parties for intellectual property relating to some of the products we sell, and our inability to maintain or enter into future license agreements may result in our failure to meet customer demand, which would adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe have licenses or manufacturing agreements with third parties that own intellectual property (e.g., formulae, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, patents and other technology) used in the manufacture and sale of certain of our products. In the event that any such license or manufacturing agreement expires or is otherwise terminated, we will lose the right to use the intellectual property covered by such license or agreement and will have to develop or obtain rights to use other intellectual property. Similarly, our rights could be reduced if the applicable licensor or third-party manufacturer fails to maintain or protect the licensed intellectual property because, in such event, our competitors could obtain the right to use the intellectual property without restriction. If this were to occur, we might not be able to develop or obtain replacement intellectual property in a timely or cost effective manner. Additionally, any modified products may not be well-received by customers. The consequences of losing the right to use or having reduced rights to such intellectual property could negatively impact our business and sales due to our failure to meet consumer demand for the affected products or require us to incur costs for the development of new or different intellectual property, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, development of replacement products may be time-consuming and ultimately may not be feasible.\nVirtually all of our assets consist of goodwill and intangible assets and are subject to impairment risk.\nAs our financial statements indicate, the majority of our assets consist of goodwill and intangible assets, principally the trademarks, tradenames and patents that we have acquired. On an annual basis, and otherwise when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of intangible assets might not be recoverable, we assess the potential impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets. If any of our brands sustain significant or prolonged declines in revenues or profitability or performance not in line with our expectations, the carrying value may no longer be recoverable, in which case a non-cash impairment charge may be recorded in future periods. For example, if the Company\u2019s brand performance is weaker than projections used in valuation calculations, the value of such brands may become impaired. In the event that such analysis would result in the fair value being lower than the carrying value, we would be required to record an impairment charge. A significant charge in our financial statements would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Although we experienced revenue declines in certain brands and we recorded non-cash impairment charges in 2021 and 2019 for certain assets, we continue to believe that the fair value of our brands exceed their carrying values as adjusted. However, sustained or significant future declines in revenue, profitability, lost distribution, other adverse changes in expected operating results, and/or unfavorable changes in economic factors used to estimate fair value of certain brands could indicate that the fair value no longer exceeds the carrying value, in which case a non-cash impairment charge may be recorded in future periods. Should the value of those assets or other assets become further impaired or our financial condition be materially adversely affected in any way, we would not have tangible assets that could be sold to repay our liabilities. As a result, our creditors and investors may not be able to recoup the amount of the indebtedness that they have extended to us or the amount they have invested in us.\nWe rely significantly on information technology. Any inadequacy, interruption, theft or loss of data, malicious attack, integration failure, failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on our systems or other security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and damage the reputation of our brands.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, to manage the data, communications and business processes for all of our functions, including our marketing, sales (including e-commerce), manufacturing, logistics, customer service, accounting and administrative functions. These systems include programs and processes relating to internal communications and communications with other parties, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, marketing and selling products to customers (including through e-commerce channels), customer order entry and order fulfillment, shipping product to customers, billing customers and receiving and applying payment, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, collecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor, and other stakeholder information and personal data, and other processes necessary to manage the Company's business.\nWe have been, and likely will continue to be, subject to malware, computer viruses, computer hacking, attempted acts of data theft, phishing, other cyber-attacks and employee error or malfeasance related to our information technology systems. We do\nnot believe that any of these attacks or events has had a material adverse impact on our business, but future attacks could result in a serious information security breach and have a material adverse impact on our business or results of operations.\nIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of the information technology systems, networks, and services of the Company, its customers and business partners, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data of the Company, its customers and business partners. As a result, the Company's information technology systems, networks or service providers could be damaged or cease to function properly or the Company could suffer a loss or disclosure of business, personal or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, including system disruptions, catastrophic events, power outages, cyber-attacks and security breaches. To help guard against these possibilities, the Company provides employee security training and maintains a compliance program with updated security policies to help evaluate and address potential threats and attacks. The Company has also conducted regular security audits by an outside firm based on NIST standards to address any potential service interruptions or vulnerabilities. However, if these plans do not provide effective protection, the Company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct its operations, including in all of the Company\u2019s functions described above, which may adversely affect its business and results of operations. The Company maintains security risk insurance in the event of a cybersecurity breach or incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all losses. The Company may need to expend additional resources in the future to continue to protect against, or to address problems caused by, any business interruptions or data security breaches.\nAny breach of our data security, including the failure to maintain the security of confidential data and information or the misappropriation of such confidential data and information, could result in an unauthorized release or transfer of customer, consumer, user or employee information, or the loss of valuable business data or cause a disruption in our business. These events could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our reputation, damage our customer, consumer or user relationships and result in lost sales, fines, lawsuits, remediation costs, or otherwise adversely impact the Company's results of operations and financial condition. We may also be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against or respond to or alleviate problems caused by a security breach.\nAs we conduct our operations, we move data across national borders, and consequently we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the United States and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security. The scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of European Union law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches, became effective in May 2018. In addition, the State of California enacted a data privacy law applicable to entities serving or employing California residents (the \u201cCCPA\u201d) that required compliance by January 2020 and other states are doing the same. We may not be able to comply with all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements and to do so may impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time.\nRisks Related to our Financing\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, and the significant amount of cash we need to service our debt would not be available to reinvest in our business.\nAt March 31, 2021, our total indebtedness, including current maturities, was approximately $1.5 billion.\nOur indebtedness could:\n\u2022Increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022Limit our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions;\n\u2022Require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations toward repayment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022Limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022Place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022Limit, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all.\nThe terms of the indentures governing our 3.750% senior notes due April 1, 2031 (the \"2021 Senior Notes\") and our 5.125% senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2028 (the \"2019 Senior Notes\"), and the credit agreement governing our term loan and revolving credit facility, allow us to issue and incur additional debt only upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in those respective agreements. If new debt is added to current debt levels, the related risks described above could increase.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced its intention to transition away from LIBOR, with its full elimination to occur after 2021. The subsequent announcement in March 2021 indicated the last committed publication date for 1-month LIBOR will cease publishing immediately after June 30, 2023, and therefore may not continue to be available on the current basis (or at all) after this date. The Alternate Reference Rate Committee, convened by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the New York Federal Reserve Bank, has endorsed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as its preferred replacement benchmark for U.S. dollar LIBOR. SOFR is calculated and published by the New York Federal Reserve Bank and reflects the combination of three overnight U.S. Treasury Repo Rates. The rate is different from LIBOR, in that it is a risk-free rate, is backward-looking instead of forward-looking, is a secured rate and currently is available primarily as an overnight rate rather than a 1-,3- or 6-month rate available for LIBOR. Our term loan and revolving credit facility currently use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. If LIBOR ceases to exist and we do not want to use the alternative base rate under our term loan and/or cannot come to an agreement on a replacement rate under our revolving credit facility, we may need to renegotiate the terms of that indebtedness to replace LIBOR with SOFR or the new standard that is established. As a result, the potential effect of eliminating LIBOR could increase the cost of our variable rate indebtedness.\nAt March 31, 2021, we had $132.2 million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility to support our operating activities.\nOur operating flexibility is limited in significant respects by the restrictive covenants in our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes.\nOur senior credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes impose restrictions that could impede our ability to enter into certain corporate transactions, as well as increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, by limiting our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our business and industry. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022Borrow money or issue guarantees;\n\u2022Pay dividends, repurchase stock from, or make other restricted payments to, stockholders;\n\u2022Make investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022Use assets as security in other transactions;\n\u2022Sell assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022Enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022Sell stock in our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022Limits our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or make other payments to us.\nOur ability to engage in these types of transactions is generally limited by the terms of the senior credit facility and the indentures governing the senior notes, even if we believe that a specific transaction would positively contribute to our future growth, operating results or profitability.\nIn addition, our senior credit facility requires us to maintain certain leverage, interest coverage and fixed charge ratios. Although we believe we can continue to meet and/or maintain the financial covenants contained in our credit agreement, our ability to do so may be affected by events outside our control. Covenants in our senior credit facility also require us to use 100% of the proceeds we receive from non-permitted debt issuances or certain issuances of refinancing debt to repay outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility. Any failure by us to comply with the terms and conditions of the credit agreement and the indentures governing the senior notes could result in an event of default, which may allow our creditors to accelerate our debt and therefore have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe senior credit facility and the indentures governing the senior notes contain cross-default provisions that could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness.\nThe senior credit facility and the indentures governing the senior notes contain provisions that allow the respective creditors to declare all outstanding borrowings under one agreement to be immediately due and payable as a result of a default under another agreement. Consequently, failure to make a payment required by the indentures governing the senior notes, among other things, may lead to an event of default under the senior credit facility. Similarly, an event of default or failure to make a required payment at maturity under the senior credit facility, among other things, may lead to an event of default under the indentures governing the senior notes. If the debt under the senior credit facility and indentures governing the senior notes had both been accelerated, the aggregate amount immediately due and payable as of March 31, 2021 would have been approximately $1.5 billion. We presently do not have sufficient liquidity to repay these borrowings in the event they were to be accelerated, and we may not have sufficient liquidity in the future to do so. Additionally, we may not be able to borrow money from other lenders to enable us to refinance our indebtedness. At March 31, 2021, the book value of our current assets was $269.8 million. Although the book value of our total assets was $3,429.3 million, approximately $3,053.8 million was in the form of intangible assets, including goodwill of $578.1 million, a significant portion of which may not be available to satisfy our creditors in the event our debt is accelerated.\nAny failure to comply with the restrictions of the senior credit facility, the indentures governing the senior notes or any other subsequent financing agreements may result in an event of default. Such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt, as well as any other debt to which the cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions apply. In addition, the lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with additional funding. As a result, any default by us under our credit agreement, indentures governing the senior notes or any other financing agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the risk of, and from time to time in the ordinary course of business we are involved in, litigation by employees, customers, consumers, suppliers, competitors, regulators, stockholders or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of our products, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. For example, although our marketing is evidence-based, consumers and competitors may challenge, and have challenged, certain of our marketing claims by alleging, among other things, false and misleading advertising with respect to advertising for certain of our products. Such challenges could result in our having to pay monetary damages or limit our ability to maintain current marketing claims. Conversely, we have, and may be required in the future to initiate litigation against others to protect the value of our intellectual property and the related goodwill or enforce an agreement or contract that has been breached. These matters may be time consuming and expensive, but may be necessary to protect our assets and realize the benefits of the agreements and contracts that we have negotiated. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our key personnel, and the loss of the services provided by any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management. These employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time. We may not be able to successfully retain existing personnel or identify, hire and integrate new personnel. While we believe we have developed depth and experience among our key personnel, our business may be adversely affected if one or more of these key individuals were to leave or were to experience serious illness, become disabled, or pass away. We do not maintain any key-man or similar insurance policies covering any of our senior management or key personnel.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and Delaware law may discourage potential acquirers of our company, which could adversely affect the value of our securities.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our Board of Directors is authorized to issue from time to time, without further stockholder approval, up to five million shares of preferred stock in one or more series of preferred stock\nissuances. Our Board of Directors may establish the number of shares to be included in each series of preferred stock and determine, as applicable, the voting and other powers, designations, preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions for such series of preferred stock. The shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. We may issue additional preferred stock in ways which may delay, defer or prevent a change in control of the Company without further action by our stockholders. The shares of preferred stock may be issued with voting rights that may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock by increasing the number of outstanding shares having voting rights, and by the creation of class or series voting rights.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, contains additional provisions that may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third-party to acquire or attempt to acquire control of our company. In addition, we are subject to certain provisions of Delaware law that limit, in some cases, our ability to engage in certain business combinations with significant stockholders.\nThese provisions, either alone, or in combination with each other, give our current directors and executive officers the ability to significantly influence the outcome of a proposed acquisition of the Company. These provisions would apply even if an acquisition or other significant corporate transaction was considered beneficial by some of our stockholders. If a change in control or change in management is delayed or prevented by these provisions, the market price of our outstanding securities could be adversely impacted.\nChanges in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors, some of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022Changes in the income allocation methods for state taxes, and the determination of which states or countries have jurisdiction to tax our Company;\n\u2022An increase in non-deductible expenses for tax purposes, including certain stock-based compensation, executive compensation and impairment of goodwill;\n\u2022Transfer pricing adjustments;\n\u2022Tax assessments resulting from tax audits or any related tax interest or penalties that could significantly affect our income tax provision for the period in which the settlement takes place;\n\u2022Tax liabilities from acquired businesses;\n\u2022Changes in accounting principles; and\n\u2022Changes in tax laws or related interpretations, accounting standards, regulations, and interpretations in multiple tax jurisdictions in which we operate.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement of the attributes prescribed in Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 740. As a multinational corporation, we conduct our business in several countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions. The taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions. Our effective tax rate is dependent upon the availability of tax credits and carryforwards. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, and the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Consequently, taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability and/or our effective income tax rate.\nIn addition, we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. If tax authorities challenge the relative mix of our U.S. and international income, or successfully assert the jurisdiction to tax our earnings, our future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 90564, "SIC": 5122, "TIC": "PBH"}
