{"cik": "1124105", "company": "TARGACEPT INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Merger\nThe market price of Targacept common stock following the Proposed Merger may decline as a result of the transaction.\nThe market price of Targacept common stock may decline as a result of the Proposed Merger for a number of reasons, including if:\n\u2022\ninvestors react negatively to the prospects of the combined company\u2019s business and prospects; or\n\u2022\nthe performance of the combined company\u2019s business or its future prospects are not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.\nTargacept stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in, and will exercise less influence over the management of, the combined company following the consummation of the merger.\nAfter the consummation of the Proposed Merger, the current stockholders of Targacept will own a significantly smaller percentage of the combined company than their ownership of Targacept prior to the merger. At the effective time of the merger, Targacept stockholders will collectively own approximately 35% of the outstanding shares of the combined company. In addition, the seven-member Board of Directors of the combined company will initially be comprised of four current Catalyst directors and three current Targacept directors. Consequently, stockholders of Targacept will be able to exercise less influence over the management and policies of the combined company than they currently exercise over the management and policies of Targacept.\nTargacept stockholders may not realize a benefit from the Proposed Merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the merger.\nIf the combined company is unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits anticipated from the Proposed Merger, Targacept stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests\nwithout receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the combined company is able to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Proposed Merger.\nFailure to complete the Proposed Merger may adversely affect the common stock price of Targacept and future business and operations of the Company.\nIf the Proposed Merger is not completed, Targacept is subject to the following risks:\n\u2022\nif the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Targacept will be required to pay Catalyst a termination fee of $3.22 million, and/or to reimburse Catalyst for up to $1.25 million in certain transaction expenses;\n\u2022\nthe attention of management of Targacept will have been diverted to the Proposed Merger instead of being directed solely to its own operations and the pursuit of other opportunities that may have been beneficial to the Company;\n\u2022\nthe loss of time and resources of Targacept;\n\u2022\nthe price of Targacept stock may decline and remain volatile; and\n\u2022\ncosts related to the Proposed Merger, such as legal, accounting and transaction agent fees, some of which must be paid even if the Proposed Merger is not completed.\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and the board of directors of Targacept determines to seek another business combination, there can be no assurance that Targacept will be able to find a transaction that is superior or equal in value to the Proposed Merger.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nThe success of the merger will depend on, among other things, the combined company\u2019s ability to achieve its business objectives, including the successful development of its product candidates. If the combined company is not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully, may take longer to realize than expected, or may not be realized at all.\nTargacept and Catalyst have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures or policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with third parties and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. Integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management\u2019s attention and resources. Any delays in the integration process or inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the merger could have an adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations. Such an adverse effect on our business may impact the value of the shares of the combined company\u2019s common stock after the completion of the merger.\nIn addition, Catalyst could be materially adversely affected prior to the closing of the merger, which could have a material adverse effect on the combined company if Targacept is required to complete the merger. For example, Targacept is required under the Merger Agreement to complete the merger despite any changes in general economic or political conditions or the capital or securities markets in general to the extent they do not disproportionately affect Catalyst; any changes in or affecting the industries in which Catalyst operates, to the extent they do not disproportionately affect Catalyst; any changes, effects or circumstances resulting from the announcement or pendency of the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the contemplated transactions or compliance with the terms of the Merger Agreement; any changes in laws or applicable accounting principles, or interpretations thereof; and the commencement, continuation or escalation of war, terrorism or hostilities, or\nnatural disasters or political events. If any such adverse changes occur and the Proposed Merger is still consummated, the combined company\u2019s stock price may suffer. This in turn may reduce the value of the merger to the stockholders of Targacept.\nDuring the pendency of the merger, Targacept may not be able to enter into a business combination with another party at a favorable price because of restrictions in the Merger Agreement, which could adversely affect its business.\nCovenants in the Merger Agreement generally prohibit Targacept and Catalyst from entering into certain extraordinary transactions with any third party, including mergers, purchases or sales of assets, or other business combinations, subject to certain exceptions relating to fiduciary duties, or from completing other transactions that are not in the ordinary course of business pending completion of the Proposed Merger, including transactions that may be favorable to the companies or their stockholders. As a result, if the Proposed Merger is not completed, our business may be adversely impacted by our inability to pursue other beneficial opportunities during the pendency of the Proposed Merger.\nProvisions of the Merger Agreement may discourage third parties from submitting alternative acquisition proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the Proposed Merger.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement prohibit Targacept from soliciting alternative takeover proposals or cooperating with persons making unsolicited takeover proposals, except in limited circumstances when Targacept\u2019s board of directors determines in good faith that an unsolicited alternative takeover proposal is or is reasonably likely to succeed, to lead to a superior takeover proposal and that failure to pursue such proposal would be considered a breach of the board\u2019s fiduciary duties. If Targacept terminates the Merger Agreement because it enters into an alternative superior transaction, Targacept would be required to pay a termination fee of $3.22 million to Catalyst. Such termination fee may discourage third parties from submitting alternative takeover proposals to Targacept, and may cause the board of directors to be less inclined to recommend an alternative proposal.\nThe lack of a public market for Catalyst shares makes it difficult to determine the fair market value of Catalyst, and the merger consideration to be issued to Catalyst securityholders may exceed the actual value of Catalyst.\nThe outstanding capital stock of Catalyst is privately held and is not traded on any public market, which makes it difficult to determine the fair market value of Catalyst. Although Targacept\u2019s board of directors believes it has taken all reasonable steps to reach an accurate determination of Catalyst\u2019s value, there can be no assurances that the merger consideration to be issued to Catalyst securityholders does not exceed the actual value of Catalyst.\nIf the redeemable convertible notes are redeemed for cash instead of converted for stock, the combined company may need to raise additional dilutive capital.\nIn connection with the Proposed Merger, Targacept stockholders will receive a Pre-Closing Dividend consisting of approximately $37 million in aggregate principal amount of redeemable convertible notes, as well as cash. The notes will be convertible at any time for two years following closing into shares of the combined company at a conversion price of $1.31 per share, which represents 130% of the negotiated per-share value of the Company\u2019s assets following the anticipated Pre-Closing Dividend. The combined company is expected to have a cash balance of approximately $77 million upon closing of the Proposed Merger. If all of the notes are redeemed for cash and not converted into stock of the combined company, the approximately $37 million of cash required to satisfy the redemption will not be available to fund the ongoing operations of the combined company. If a substantial amount of the cash balance of the combined company is required to satisfy note redemptions, the combined company may need to raise additional dilutive capital in the future to fund operations.\nIf the merger is not completed, the Pre-Closing Dividend will not be paid to Targacept stockholders.\nPayment of the Pre-Closing Dividend to the Targacept stockholders is contingent upon the completion of the Proposed Merger. If the Proposed Merger does not occur, the Targacept stockholders will not be paid the Pre-Closing Dividend, and there is no assurance the Targacept board of directors will declare or pay any dividends on the Targacept common stock in the future.\nTargacept may not be able to complete the Proposed Merger and may elect to pursue another strategic transaction similar to the Proposed Merger, which may not occur on commercially reasonably terms or at all.\nTargacept cannot assure you that it will complete the Proposed Merger in a timely manner or at all. The Merger Agreement is subject to many closing conditions and termination rights. Targacept\u2019s assets currently consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and its listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. If Targacept does not consummate the Proposed Merger, its board of directors may elect to attempt to complete another strategic transaction similar to the Proposed Merger. Such attempts will likely be costly and time consuming, and Targacept cannot make any assurances that a future strategic transaction will occur on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIf the Proposed Merger is not completed, Targacept may elect to liquidate its remaining assets, and there can be no assurances as to the amount of cash available to distribute to stockholders after paying its debts and other obligations.\nIf Targacept does not complete the Proposed Merger, the board of directors may elect to take the steps necessary to liquidate all remaining assets of Targacept in light of the risks of reestablishing an operating business. The process of liquidation may be lengthy and Targacept cannot make any assurances regarding the timing of completing such a process. In addition, Targacept would be required to pay all of its debts and contractual obligations, and to set aside certain reserves for potential future claims. There can be no assurance as to the amount of available cash that will be available to distribute to stockholders after paying Targacept\u2019s debts and other obligations and setting aside funds for reserves, nor as to the timing of any such distribution.\nIf the Proposed Merger is not completed, and Targacept fails to acquire or develop other products or product candidates on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, Targacept may be unable to reestablish a viable operating business.\nIf the Proposed Merger is not completed, Targacept could be required to rely on in-licensing as the source of any of future product candidates for development and commercialization. Due to Targacept\u2019s history, its current limited operational and management capabilities, and the intense competition for pharmaceutical product candidates, even if Targacept finds promising product candidates and generates interest in a collaborative or strategic arrangement to acquire such product candidates, it may not be able to acquire rights to additional product candidates or approved products on commercially reasonable terms that it finds acceptable, or at all. Proposing, negotiating and implementing an economically viable product acquisition or license is a lengthy and complex process. Targacept competes for collaborative arrangements and license agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic research institutions. Targacept\u2019s competitors may have stronger relationships with third parties with whom we may be interested in collaborating, or they may have greater financial, development and commercialization resources or more established histories of developing and commercializing products than Targacept. As a result, such competitors may have a competitive advantage over Targacept in entering into collaborative arrangements.\nTargacept expects that any product candidate to which it acquires rights will require additional development and regulatory efforts prior to commercial sale, including extensive clinical testing and approval by the FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory authorities. All product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in\npharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that the product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities and the possibility that, due to strategic considerations, Targacept will discontinue research or development with respect to a product candidate for which it has already incurred significant expense. Even if the product candidates receive regulatory approval, Targacept cannot be sure that such product candidates would be capable of economically feasible production or commercial success.\nWe will incur substantial transaction-related costs in connection with the Proposed Merger.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, a number of non-recurring transaction-related costs associated with completing the Proposed Merger and combining the two companies. These fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, substantial. Non-recurring transaction costs include, but are not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial and accounting advisors, severance and benefit costs, filing fees and printing costs. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of Targacept and Catalyst which may be higher than expected and could have a material adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nA failure by Targacept to comply with the initial listing standards of the NASDAQ Global Select Market may subject its stock to delisting from the NASDAQ Global Select Market, which listing is a condition to the consummation of the merger.\nTargacept\u2019s common stock is currently listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Immediately prior to the consummation of the merger, Targacept will be required to meet the initial listing requirements to maintain the listing and continued trading of its shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. These initial listing requirements are more difficult to achieve than the continued listing requirements under which Targacept is now trading. Based on information currently available to Targacept, Targacept anticipates that it will be unable to meet the $4.00 minimum bid price initial listing requirement at the closing of the merger unless it effects a reverse stock split. If Targacept is unable to satisfy these requirements, NASDAQ may notify Targacept that its stock will be subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. It is a condition to Catalyst\u2019s obligation to consummate the merger that Targacept maintain the listing of its common stock on NASDAQ. In addition, oftentimes a reverse stock split will not result in a trading price for the affected common stock that is proportional to the ratio of the split. Targacept believes that a reverse stock split will be in the best interest of the combined company and its stockholders. However, Targacept cannot assure you that the implementation of the reverse stock split will have a positive impact on the price of its common stock.\nWe may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm the company\u2019s business and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all costs and damages.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation often follows certain significant business transactions, such as the sale of a business division or announcement of a merger. The combined company may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation often is expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe currently have only one product candidate in clinical development, and our recent clinical trials have resulted in significant clinical pipeline attrition. As we have closed our laboratory operations and no longer have the capability to discover new product candidates internally, we may not be able to overcome this attrition without purchasing or relying on other sources for new product candidates.\nIn 2012, we completed two workforce reductions and closed our laboratory operations. Following these actions, we do not have internal discovery and research capabilities to identify and discover new product candidates. We have no current plan to resume discovery or research activities. If in the future we were to resume these activities, we would need to recruit additional scientific and technical personnel and obtain access to laboratory facilities.\nWe currently have only one product candidate in clinical trials and, without internal discovery and research, we will not be able to expand our pipeline with internal candidates. If we are unable to expand our portfolio of product candidates through acquisitions or in-licensing, which we may be unable to do on reasonable terms or at all, our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nA small number of our stockholders beneficially own a substantial amount of our common stock and have substantial control over us; therefore, your ability to influence corporate matters may be limited.\nSignificant stockholders, acting together, have the ability to affect matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the approval of significant transactions, like the Proposed Merger. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a strategic transaction, even if such a transaction would benefit other stockholders.\nOur ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses to reduce future tax payments is limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and may be subject to further limitation as a result of prior or future offerings of our stock or other transactions.\nSections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally an increase in the ownership percentage of certain stockholders in the stock of a company by more than 50 percent over a three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company. Generally, if an ownership change as defined by Section 382 occurs, the yearly taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses is equal to the product of the applicable long term tax exempt rate and the value of the company\u2019s stock immediately before the ownership change. The Proposed Merger may result in such an ownership change. If any of our past or future transactions are determined to have caused one or more Section 382 ownership changes, we generally would not be able to use our pre-change loss or credit carryovers or certain built-in losses prior to such ownership change to offset future taxable income in excess of the annual limitations imposed by Sections 382 and 383, which may result in the expiration of a portion of our tax attributes before utilization.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results\nWe have a substantial accumulated deficit and may incur losses for future periods. We may not achieve profitability for any future period or, if we do achieve profitability for a future period, we may not sustain or grow our profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $313.3 million. We had a net loss of $32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and net losses of $46.7 million and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our losses for other periods have historically resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities, including clinical trials, and from general and administrative expenses associated with our operations. We may incur losses for future periods as we progress our programs and invest in or evaluate additional strategic opportunities. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability in the future or, if we do achieve profitability for any particular period, to sustain or grow our profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nWe derived a substantial portion of our revenue for 2013 and 2012 from our strategic alliances and collaborations, which have all terminated. We do not currently have any source of product revenue. We expect that a substantial portion of our operating cash flow in the next few years will depend on the following:\n\u2022\nwhether we establish additional strategic alliances, collaborations or licensing or other comparable arrangements, or whether we complete the merger with Catalyst or another significant corporate transaction, and, if we do, the associated terms in each case; and\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, duration, results and cost of clinical trials, as well as non-clinical studies and assessments, of our product candidates and programs.\nSources that have contributed to our revenue for any particular year may not continue. For example, we received $245 million in aggregate payments under two collaborations with global pharmaceutical companies that are now terminated and no longer sources of future revenue. Additionally, we do not currently have any source of product revenue.\nIf we are unable to develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, if development is delayed or if revenue from sales of any product candidate that receives marketing approval is insufficient, we may not achieve profitability in the future. Even if we are profitable for any particular period, we may not be able to sustain or grow our profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nOur failure to obtain additional capital when needed could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nSuccessful drug development and commercialization requires significant amounts of capital. It is foreseeable that we will in the future require substantial additional capital in order to continue to conduct the development and regulatory activities necessary to bring our product candidates to market (or, where applicable for a particular product candidate, to the stage of development when a potential future collaborator may assume responsibility under the terms of the applicable agreement for funding further development and subsequent commercialization) and potentially to establish sales and marketing capabilities. Our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, duration, results and costs of clinical trials, as well as non-clinical studies and assessments, of our product candidates and programs;\n\u2022\nwhether we establish additional strategic alliances, collaborations or licensing or other comparable arrangements, or whether we pursue and complete any merger, acquisition or other significant corporate transaction, and, if we do, the associated terms in each case;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we retain development or commercialization rights or responsibilities for our product candidates and incur associated development costs, manufacturing costs or costs to establish sales and marketing functions;\n\u2022\nthe number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue and programs that we conduct;\n\u2022\nthe costs to satisfy our obligations under potential future alliances and collaborations;\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending patents and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe costs of manufacturing-related services for our product candidates in development;\n\u2022\nthe costs, timing and outcomes of regulatory reviews or other regulatory actions;\n\u2022\nthe timing, receipt and amount of sales or royalties, if any, from our potential products;\n\u2022\nthe extent of our general and administrative expenses; and\n\u2022\nthe rate of technological advancements for the indications that we target.\nIn addition, we may seek additional capital, whether through offerings of securities utilizing our currently effective Registration Statement on Form S-3, our at the market sales agreement or otherwise, if the conditions for raising capital are favorable or based on strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our stockholders may be diluted, and the terms of the securities may include liquidation or other preferences that materially and adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through alliance, collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe had approximately $111 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments at December 31, 2014, which, based on our current scope of operations, would be sufficient to fund our current operations for several years. However, there is substantial uncertainty associated with our ongoing evaluation of strategic alternatives and the potential costs associated with those alternatives, which may fundamentally change our business and capital requirements. As a result, we may need additional funds sooner than planned to meet operational needs and capital requirements to fund strategic transactions, pipeline diversification or other business and corporate development initiatives. Our ability to raise additional funds if and when needed on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, is uncertain.\nRisks Related to the Development and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates\nTC-6499 has not yet demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in diabetic gastroparesis, and our previous findings from clinical and nonclinical studies and assessments may not be predictive of a benefit for TC-6499 as a treatment for diabetic gastroparesis. If our ongoing and any future clinical trials of TC-6499 in diabetic gastroparesis are not successful, we will not obtain the regulatory approvals required to market and sell TC-6499.\nWe are conducting an exploratory study of TC-6499 as a treatment for diabetic gastroparesis. Our decision to conduct this study was based primarily on various findings from a previous clinical trial of TC-6499 in another indication and nonclinical studies and assessments of TC-6499 that we believe may indicate potential benefits of TC-6499 as a diabetic gastroparesis therapy. We have not previously conducted any clinical trials of TC-6499 in patients with diabetic gastroparesis, and our previous findings may not be predictive of clinical success in this patient population. If our ongoing and any future clinical trials of TC-6499 in diabetic gastroparesis are not successful, we will not obtain the regulatory approvals required to market and sell TC-6499 as a treatment for diabetic gastroparesis.\nIf we do not obtain the regulatory approvals required to market and sell our product candidates, our ability to generate product revenue will be materially impaired and our business will not be successful.\nThe nonclinical laboratory testing, development, manufacturing and clinical trials of product candidates that we develop, whether independently or in collaboration with a third party, as well as their distribution, sale and marketing, are regulated by the FDA and other federal, state and local governmental and regulatory authorities in the United States and by similar agencies in other countries. We must receive regulatory approval of each product candidate before we can market and sell it. We have only limited experience in pursuing regulatory approvals. Securing FDA approval requires the submission of extensive nonclinical and clinical data and information about the chemistry and manufacture of, and control procedures for, each potential product. In addition, the supporting information submitted to the FDA must establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each indicated use. The drug development and marketing approval process takes many years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources, is subject to delays and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. In addition to the time and expense involved, the process is uncertain and we may never receive the required regulatory approvals. In addition, the FDA, the U.S. Congress or foreign governmental or regulatory authorities may from time to time change approval policies or adopt new laws or regulations that could prevent or delay our receipt of required approvals. Even if we receive regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, the approval will be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed and may not permit labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for its promotion.\nA Phase 1 clinical trial program typically takes several months to complete, a Phase 2 clinical trial program typically takes several months to two years to complete and a Phase 3 clinical trial program typically takes one to four years to complete. Moreover, Phase 3 clinical trials may not follow successful completion of Phase 2 clinical trials directly, as additional non-clinical assessments or clinical trials may first be required. Industry sources have reported that the preparation and submission of an NDA, which is required for regulatory approval in the United States, generally takes six months to one year to complete after completion of pivotal clinical trials. However, additional clinical trials may be required by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities following completion of pivotal clinical trials and prior to seeking approval. Precise estimates vary, but a great majority of investigational drugs that enter clinical trials will never be approved by the FDA for commercial sale.\nThe FDA may delay, limit or deny approval of any of our product candidates for many reasons. For example:\n\u2022\nclinical trial results may indicate that the product candidate is not safe;\n\u2022\nclinical trial results may indicate that the product candidate is not effective, whether because the product candidate does not have its intended effects in the clinical trial, because subjects given an inactive comparator (i.e., placebo) in the clinical trial experience benefits comparable to the benefits experienced by subjects given the product candidate, which obscures the effects of the product candidate, or for any other reason;\n\u2022\nthe product candidate may not have a favorable risk/benefit profile;\n\u2022\nthe FDA (or any advisory committee on which the FDA relies) may interpret results of clinical trials or manufacturing or other non-clinical studies or assessments to indicate that the product candidate is not safe, effective or acceptable for commercial use, even if we interpret the same results differently;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may require development of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as a condition of approval;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may deem the processes or facilities that we, our collaborators or our third-party manufacturers propose to use in connection with the manufacture of the product candidate to be unacceptable, or the facilities of our third party manufacturers may not pass inspection by the FDA; or\n\u2022\nthe FDA may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nIf we obtain the requisite regulatory approval for a particular product candidate, the approval may not extend to all indications for which approval was sought, which could limit the use of the product and materially and adversely impact our revenue.\nEven if the FDA approves a product candidate for marketing and sale in the United States, applicable regulatory authorities in other countries may not approve the product candidate or may subject their approval to conditions such as additional product testing or otherwise cause delays. The regulatory approval process varies among countries, but generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, many countries require a separate review process prior to marketing to determine whether their respective national health insurance schemes will pay for newly approved products, as well as the price that may be charged. This process is likely to cause delays in the marketing of any of our product candidates that receives approval and could materially and adversely impact our revenue and results of operations.\nIf clinical trials for our product candidates are not successful, we will not obtain the regulatory approvals required to market and sell them.\nTo obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to market and sell any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate, through extensive nonclinical studies and clinical trials, that the product candidate is safe and effective in humans. The number of clinical trials required to obtain approval varies depending on the particular product candidate, the disease or condition for which it is in development and the regulations applicable to it. Nonclinical studies and clinical trials are lengthy and expensive, difficult to design and implement and subject to a historically high rate of failure. The development of each of our product candidates involves significant risks at each stage of testing. A failure of one or more clinical trials of any of our product candidates could occur at any stage of testing. For example, TC-5214 did not achieve the primary endpoint in multiple Phase 3 clinical trials in major depressive disorder completed in 2011 and 2012, nor did it meet one of the co-primary endpoints in the Phase 2b clinical trial in overactive bladder in 2014. As a consequence, we no longer have plans to pursue additional development of this compound in these therapeutic areas. If we experience failures in our ongoing or future clinical trials, or if we are not able to design clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidates and otherwise achieve the objectives of the trials, our product candidates may never be approved for sale or become commercially available.\nWe may not be able to obtain authority or approval from the FDA, applicable foreign regulatory authorities or the institutional review boards at our intended investigational sites to commence or complete our clinical trials. Before the initial clinical trial for a product candidate may commence in the United States, we must submit an IND containing nonclinical studies, chemistry, manufacturing, control and other information and a study protocol to the FDA. If the FDA does not object within 30 days after submission of the IND, then the trial may commence. If a clinical trial is commenced, we, the FDA, applicable foreign regulatory authorities and institutional review boards may delay, suspend or terminate clinical trials of a product candidate at any time if, among other reasons, we or they believe the subjects participating in the clinical trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons.\nIf we do not prove in clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective, we will not obtain marketing approvals from the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authorities. In particular, one or more of our product candidates may not exhibit the expected medical benefits in humans, may cause harmful side effects or may have other unexpected characteristics that preclude regulatory approval for any or all indications of use or limit commercial use if approved.\nOur product candidates target diseases or disorders that are not well understood. For example, there is only limited scientific understanding of the causes of diabetic gastroparesis. In addition, there are no approved drugs that target NNRs to treat diabetic gastroparesis, and there is only limited scientific understanding of the relationships between diabetic gastroparesis and the pathway targeted by our product candidates. These uncertainties increase the risk that our ongoing and future clinical trials will not be successful.\nIf clinical trials for any of our product candidates are prolonged or delayed, we would experience a delay in the commercialization of the affected product candidates, which may require us to incur additional costs and delay our receipt of any revenue from potential product sales.\nWe cannot predict whether we will encounter problems with any ongoing or planned clinical trials of our product candidates that will cause us or any regulatory authority to delay or suspend those clinical trials or delay the analysis of data derived from them. A number of events, including those described below, could delay the initiation or completion of any ongoing or planned clinical trial of any of our product candidates or otherwise negatively impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and to market and sell, the product candidate:\n\u2022\nconditions imposed on us by the FDA or any foreign regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of the clinical trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in recruiting and enrolling subjects into the clinical trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining, or our inability to obtain, required approvals from institutional review boards, ethics committees or other reviewing entities at clinical sites selected for participation in the clinical trial;\n\u2022\ninsufficient supply or deficient quality of the product candidate or other materials necessary to conduct the clinical trial;\n\u2022\nlower than anticipated retention rate of subjects in the clinical trial;\n\u2022\nnegative or inconclusive results from the clinical trial, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results, that necessitate additional study;\n\u2022\nserious and unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by subjects in the clinical trial; or\n\u2022\nfailure of our third-party contractors to comply with regulatory requirements or otherwise meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner.\nClinical trials require sufficient subject enrollment, which is a function of many factors-including the size of the patient population, the extent to which other clinical trials are being conducted concurrently that involve the same patient population, the number of participating clinical sites, the proximity of subjects to clinical sites, the nature of the trial protocol, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial and the emphasis placed on ensuring a rigorous adherence to the eligibility criteria. Delays in subject enrollment can result in increased costs and longer development times. The failure to enroll subjects in a clinical trial could delay the completion of the clinical trial beyond our current expectations.\nIn addition, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could require us to conduct clinical trials for any of our product candidates with a larger number of subjects than we project. We may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of subjects in a timely or cost-effective manner. Furthermore, enrolled subjects may drop out of clinical trials, which could impair the validity or statistical analysis of those clinical trials.\nWe do not know whether any clinical trial of any of our product candidates will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, if at all. Delays in clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates. In addition, if our clinical trials are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be limited.\nEach of our product candidates will remain subject to ongoing regulatory review even if it receives marketing approval. If we fail to comply with continuing regulations or if patients taking our products experience adverse health effects, we could lose the approval or the sale of the affected products could be suspended or otherwise adversely affected.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, the approval could be conditioned on us conducting additional costly post-approval studies or could limit the indicated uses included in our labeling. In addition, if any of our product candidates becomes an approved product, the manufacturer of the product and its facilities will continue to be subject to FDA review and periodic inspections to ensure adherence to applicable regulations. We may be slow to adapt, or may never adapt, to changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with the requirements of the FDA and other applicable U.S. or foreign governmental or regulatory authorities or previously unknown problems with our products or product candidates, manufacturers or manufacturing processes are discovered, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nwarning or untitled letters;\n\u2022\ncivil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nfines;\n\u2022\ninjunctions;\n\u2022\nproduct seizures or detentions;\n\u2022\nimport bans;\n\u2022\nvoluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\ntotal or partial suspension of production; and\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications.\nWe may apply our finite resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication, fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success, or relinquish valuable rights to our disadvantage.\nBecause we have finite financial and managerial resources, we must focus on product candidates and specific indications that we believe are the most promising. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Furthermore, if we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, or if we incorrectly conclude that utilizing the expertise and resources of a collaborator in the development or potential commercialization of a particular product candidate would benefit us, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic alliances, collaborations or licensing or other comparable arrangements in cases in which it would have been advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights. Any of these decisions or conclusions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe may need to depend on alliances and collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of some of our product candidates. If our alliances and collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nWe may selectively enter into alliances and collaborations, particularly for target indications for which a potential collaborator has unique expertise or that represent large primary care markets that must be served by large sales and marketing organizations. Our ability to generate revenue from our alliances and collaborations will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities to establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, to obtain regulatory approvals and to achieve market acceptance. Strategic alliances and collaborations involving our product candidates pose many risks to us, including:\n\u2022\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the amount and timing of efforts and resources that they will apply to these alliances and collaborations or to the development of our licensed product candidates;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may interpret clinical trial or non-clinical study results differently than we do, may pursue further development and commercialization of our product candidates for indications that we do not believe are optimal, may not pursue further development and commercialization of our product candidates at all or may elect not to continue or renew research and development programs based on nonclinical or clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive;\n\u2022\ncollaborators with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit enough resources to their marketing and distribution;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between us and collaborators that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates, that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources or that, if resolved unfavorably to us, result in adverse financial consequences for us under the terms of the applicable agreements; and\n\u2022\nalliances and collaborations may be terminated, either in their entirety or as to particular product candidates or programs, which may result in a need for a reallocation of internal funds or additional capital to pursue further development of the applicable product candidates. As examples, we previously had a collaborative research and license agreement with AstraZeneca which included a multi-year preclinical research collaboration and a license granted to AstraZeneca to develop and commercialize TC-1734, an additional collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca for the development and commercialization of TC-5214 in major depressive disorder, and a product development and commercialization agreement with GlaxoSmithKline that have all been terminated. Some of these terminations caused us to reallocate internal resources.\nAlliances and collaborations may not lead to development of product candidates or commercialization of products in the most efficient manner or at all.\nIn addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. If a present or future collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nIf we do not establish additional alliances and collaborations, we may have to alter our development plans.\nOur drug development programs and potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. Our strategy includes selectively seeking alliances and collaborations to assist us in furthering development and potential commercialization of some of our product candidates. We intend to do so particularly for target indications for which a potential collaborator has unique expertise or that involve large primary care markets that must be served by large sales and marketing organizations.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate alliances and collaborations. Alliances and collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. We may not be able to negotiate them on acceptable terms, or at all. If we cannot, we may have to curtail the development of a particular product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring our product candidates to market and generate product revenue.\nIf third parties on which we rely for clinical trials do not perform as contractually required or as we expect, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct the clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. We depend on independent clinical investigators and, in many cases, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct the clinical trials of our product candidates and expect to continue to do so. We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials, but we do not control many aspects of their activities. Nonetheless, we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with regulations and guidelines, commonly referred to as good clinical practice, or GCP, for conducting and recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements.\nThird parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or the respective trial plans and protocols. These risks may be heightened for clinical trials that we conduct outside of North America and Western Europe. In particular, we have previously conducted trials of multiple product candidates at sites in India and Eastern Europe, as well as in the United States.\nLanguage barriers and the limited experience of some clinical investigators in Eastern Europe or other countries in conducting clinical trials in accordance with standards set forth by the FDA and applicable regulatory authorities may increase the risk of non-compliance. The failure of third parties to carry out their obligations could impair the credibility or reliability of the data generated in clinical trials of our product candidates, require a trial to be repeated and increase the overall cost of a development program, delay or prevent the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates or result in enforcement action against us.\nIf the performance of our contract manufacturers or any present or future collaborator of ours with manufacturing responsibility for a particular product candidate is substandard, our clinical trials and product introductions may be delayed or there may be a shortage of commercial supply.\nOur product candidates require precise, high quality manufacturing. We no longer have internal manufacturing capability. We have historically manufactured our product candidates only in small quantities for early-stage preclinical testing and have contracted with third parties to manufacture, in collaboration with us, our product candidates for clinical trials. If any of our product candidates is approved by the FDA or by foreign regulatory authorities for marketing and sale, it will need to be manufactured in substantially larger, commercial quantities. Our experience in the manufacture of drugs in commercial quantities is limited to our contractual arrangements with third parties to manufacture our now discontinued product Inversine and its active ingredient.\nFor each of our product candidates, we typically rely on single third-party contract manufacturers for manufacturing in drug substance form and single third-party contract manufacturers for manufacturing in a formulation for use in clinical trials. We intend to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers (or, where applicable, potential future collaborators) to supply, store and distribute our product candidates for our clinical trials and to manufacture commercial supplies of any product candidate that is approved for sale. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers or collaborators will expose us to risks that could delay or prevent the initiation or completion of our clinical trials, the submission of applications for regulatory approvals, the receipt of regulatory approvals or the commercialization of our products or result in higher costs or lost product revenue. In particular, any contract manufacturer or applicable collaborator of ours could:\n\u2022\nencounter difficulties in achieving volume production, laboratory testing, quality control or quality assurance or suffer shortages of qualified personnel, any of which could result in its inability to manufacture sufficient quantities to meet clinical timelines for a particular product candidate, obtain approval to market and sell the product candidate or to commercialize the product candidate; or\n\u2022\nfail to establish and follow cGMP or fail to document its adherence to cGMP, either of which could lead to significant delays in the availability of material for clinical study and delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our product candidates.\nIn addition, any contract manufacturer could:\n\u2022\nterminate or not renew its manufacturing agreement with us, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us; or\n\u2022\nbreach or fail to perform as agreed under the applicable manufacturing agreement.\nWe expect to rely initially on a single contract manufacturer for any product candidate that we successfully bring to market. Changing any manufacturer that we engage for a particular product or product candidate may be difficult, as the number of potential manufacturers is limited and we will have to compete with third parties for access to those manufacturing facilities. cGMP manufacturing processes and procedures are described in an NDA or supplement that typically must be reviewed and approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities and the facilities typically must pass inspection by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities before such approval. Changing manufacturers may require re-validation of any new facility for cGMP compliance, which would likely be costly and time-consuming. We may not be able to engage replacement manufacturers on acceptable terms quickly or at all. In addition, contract manufacturers located in foreign countries may be subject to import limitations or bans. As a result, if any contract manufacturer is unable, for whatever reason, to supply the contracted amounts of any product that is successfully brought to market, a shortage would result which would have a negative impact on our revenue.\nDrug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (in the case of controlled substances) and corresponding state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP, other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards.\nWhile we are ultimately responsible for ensuring the quality of any products manufactured by third party contractors and obligated to audit the performance of such third-party contractors, we do not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. Failure by us or any third-party manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of the government to grant pre-market approval of drugs, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of product, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property effectively, our competitors may develop and market similar products and the value of our technology and our ability to compete would be damaged.\nOur continued success depends significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain meaningful intellectual property protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how. We generally seek to protect our compounds and technologies by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology that is important to the development of our business. We file patent applications directed to our product candidates in an effort to establish intellectual property positions regarding new chemical entities, pharmaceutical compositions, formulations and uses in the treatment of diseases and disorders.\nThe patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our product candidates and technology will depend on the success that we have in obtaining valid patent claims and enforcing claims that are granted. We do not know whether any of our patent applications or those patent applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated, rendered unenforceable or circumvented, any of which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages against competitors with similar compounds or technologies. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies in a manner that does not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. If we are unable to obtain, enforce or defend the patents with respect to our product candidates, our ability to commercialize our product candidates would be materially and adversely affected and our business would suffer.\nAlthough we own or otherwise have rights to a number of patents, these patents may not effectively exclude competitors from engaging in activities that compete with us. Furthermore, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability, and third parties may challenge the validity or enforceability of our patents. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act was signed into U.S. law September 26, 2011, and includes significant changes to patent law. One of the most notable changes is the transition from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d to a \u201cfirst-inventor-to-file\u201d patent system. This is effective for patent applications filed on or after March 16, 2013. Because patent applications in the United States and many foreign countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, and because publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent the inventions claimed in our issued U.S. patents or patent applications filed on or before March 16, 2013, or that we were or will be the first to file for protection of the inventions claimed in any of our U.S. patent applications filed after March 16, 2013 or in any of our issued foreign patents or pending foreign patent applications. It is possible that a competitor may successfully challenge our patents or that challenges will result in the elimination or narrowing of patent claims and, therefore, reduce our patent protection.\nBecause of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a new drug, it is possible that any patent covering one of our product candidates may expire before the product candidate can be commercialized or remain in force for only a short period following initial commercialization. In either case, any\nadvantages of the patent would be limited. The patent laws of various foreign countries in which we intend to compete may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Changes either in patent laws or in interpretations or enforcement of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the commercial value of our technology and product candidates could be reduced.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on protection of trade secrets, know-how and confidential and proprietary information to maintain our competitive position. For example, we generally do not seek patent protection for the computer-based molecular design technologies that form part of Pentad and instead seek to maintain those technologies as trade secrets.\nTo maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors and collaborators upon the commencement of our relationship with them. These agreements typically require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. However, we may not obtain these agreements in all circumstances, and individuals with whom we have these agreements may not comply with their terms. Even if obtained, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information or an adequate remedy in the event of their unauthorized use or disclosure. The loss or exposure of our trade secrets or other proprietary information could impair our competitive position.\nWe also typically enter into agreements with employees that provide that inventions conceived by them in the course of rendering services to us are our exclusive property and, where appropriate, we enter into similar agreements with consultants and contractors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use technology or know-how owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related inventions.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business and, if we have sublicensed our license rights to a third party, the loss of the license rights may breach our obligations to our sublicensee.\nWe are a party to various license agreements. As an example, we license patent rights covering the pharmaceutical composition and methods of use of TC-5214 from University of South Florida Research Foundation. We may enter into additional licenses in the future. Our existing licenses impose, and we expect future licenses will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, whether as a result of actions or inactions by us or by any potential future collaborator of ours to which we out-license patent rights that we have in-licensed from a third party, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we may not be able to market any product that is covered by the licensed patents.\nOur patent protection for any particular compound may be limited to a specific method of use or indication. If a third party were to obtain approval of a particular compound for use in a different indication, we could be subject to competition arising from off-label use.\nAlthough we generally seek the broadest patent protection available for our compounds, we may not be able to obtain patent protection for the actual composition of any particular compound and may be limited to protecting a new method of use for the compound or otherwise restricted in our ability to prevent others from exploiting the compound. If we are unable to obtain patent protection for the actual composition of any compound that we seek to develop and commercialize and must rely on method of use patent coverage, we would\nlikely be unable to prevent others from manufacturing or marketing that compound for any use that is not protected by our patent rights. If a third party were to receive marketing approval of any compound for which we rely on method of use patent coverage for another use, physicians could nevertheless prescribe it for indications that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling or approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. Even if we have patent protection for the indication for which the product is prescribed, as a practical matter, we would have little recourse as a result of this off-label use. In that event, our revenue from the commercialization of the compound would likely be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents that could be expensive and time-consuming.\nWe may initiate patent litigation against third parties to protect or enforce our patent rights and we may similarly be sued by third parties. We may also become subject to interference, review or opposition proceedings conducted in the patent and trademark offices of various countries to determine our entitlement to patents. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings, regardless of their merit, lack of merit or eventual outcome, would be costly and a significant diversion of our technical personnel\u2019s and management\u2019s attention from conducting our business, which would harm our business. Moreover, we may not prevail in any of these suits. An adverse determination of any litigation or proceeding could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or narrowly interpreted and our patent applications at risk of not being issued and could prevent us from protecting our rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the United States.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that disclosure of some of our confidential information could be compelled and the information compromised. In addition, during the course of this kind of litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments that, if perceived as negative by securities analysts or investors, could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nClaims by third parties that we infringe their proprietary rights may result in liability for damages or prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur success depends in part on avoiding the infringement of other parties\u2019 patents and proprietary rights. Patents may issue from patent applications of which we are unaware, and avoiding patent infringement may be difficult. We may infringe or it may be alleged that we infringe third-party patents. If a third party were to file a patent infringement suit against us, we could be forced to stop or delay research and development, manufacturing or sales of any infringing product in the country or countries covered by the patent allegedly infringed, unless we can obtain a license from the patent holder. Any necessary license may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, particularly if the third party is developing or marketing a product competitive with the allegedly infringing product. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property.\nWe also may be required to pay substantial damages to the patent holder in the event of an infringement. These damages could in some circumstances be triple the actual damages the patent holder incurs. If we have supplied infringing products to third parties for marketing or have licensed third parties to manufacture, use or market infringing products, we may be obligated to indemnify these third parties for any damages they may be required to pay to the patent holder and for any losses they may sustain themselves as a result.\nAny successful infringement action brought against us may also materially and adversely affect marketing of the infringing product in other markets not covered by the infringement action, as well as our marketing of other products based on similar technology. Furthermore, we may suffer material adverse consequences from a successful infringement action against us even if the action is subsequently reversed on appeal, nullified through another action or\nresolved by settlement with the patent holder. The damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may be significant. As a result, any infringement action against us would likely delay the regulatory approval process, harm our competitive position, be very costly and require significant time and attention of our key management and technical personnel.\nRisks Related to Commercialization\nEven if approved for marketing and sale, our product candidates may not gain market acceptance and may fail to generate significant revenue.\nThe commercial success of any of our product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community and third-party payors as clinically useful, cost-effective and safe.\nThe degree of market acceptance of any drug depends on a number of factors, such as:\n\u2022\nits demonstration of efficacy and safety in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nits superior efficacy as compared to alternative treatment methods and its side effect profile;\n\u2022\nits cost-effectiveness and the availability of insurance or other third-party reimbursement;\n\u2022\nits convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe timing of its market entry relative to competitive treatments;\n\u2022\nthe extent and success of marketing and sales efforts; and\n\u2022\nthe product labeling or product insert required by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities.\nWe currently have limited sales, marketing and distribution experience and no internal sales or distribution capabilities. If we are unable to enter into alliances and collaborations or other arrangements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates or to develop our own internal marketing capability, or if we enter into such arrangements with third parties who do not perform well, we may not be successful in commercializing any products for which we receive regulatory approval.\nWe currently have limited sales, marketing and distribution experience and no internal sales or distribution capabilities. If we do not establish sales and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we may not successfully commercialize our products. There are risks involved with establishing our own sales force and marketing and distribution capabilities, as well as in entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. Developing our own sales force would be expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product launch. We may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties on terms that are favorable to us or at all. We may also have little control over the performance of potential future collaborators, any of which may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell, market or distribute our products effectively.\nUnfavorable third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives applicable to our product candidates could limit our potential product revenue.\nSuccessful commercialization of any of our product candidates for which regulatory approval is obtained will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate payment is available from government health programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors. If we succeed in bringing a product candidate to the market, it may not be considered cost-effective and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell it at a satisfactory price. Because our product candidates are in the development stage, we cannot yet determine their cost-effectiveness. We may need to conduct expensive studies in order to demonstrate cost-effectiveness. Moreover, third-party payors frequently require that pharmaceutical\ncompanies provide predetermined discounts from list prices and frequently challenge the prices charged for medical products. Because our product candidates are in the development stage, we do not yet know the level of reimbursement, if any, for any product candidates that we are able to successfully develop. If the reimbursement for any of our product candidates is inadequate in light of our development and other costs, our ability to achieve or sustain profitability could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe believe that the government and third party payors will continue to look for ways to contain or reduce the cost of health care in ways that are likely to affect the business and financial condition of pharmaceutical companies. We cannot predict the impact of these efforts on the coverage of, or prices for, any of our product candidates if they are approved.\nIf our competitors develop and market drugs that are less expensive, more effective or safer than ours, if they develop and market products faster than we do, or if they have better sales and marketing capabilities than we do, any products we are able to commercialize may not generate initial or ongoing revenue.\nThe development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive. Our business is characterized by extensive research and development efforts and rapid developments. We expect intense competition in our target markets as new products and advanced technologies become available. Our competitors include large pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies and research institutions, many of which have greater financial, technical and other resources and personnel and more experience in research and development, regulatory and drug commercialization than we have. Our competitors may:\n\u2022\ndevelop products that are more effective, safer, more tolerable, more convenient, less costly or otherwise more competitive than our product candidates;\n\u2022\nobtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do;\n\u2022\nadapt more quickly to new technologies and scientific advances than we do;\n\u2022\ninitiate or withstand substantial price competition more successfully than we do;\n\u2022\nhave greater success in recruiting skilled scientific workers from the limited pool of available talent than we do;\n\u2022\nobtain more effective intellectual property protection than we do;\n\u2022\nnegotiate third-party licensing and collaboration arrangements more effectively than we do; and\n\u2022\ntake advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we do.\nCompetitive products may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive before we can recover our development or commercialization expenses.\nAny products that we are able to successfully develop and commercialize in the future could be subject to competition from lower priced generic drugs. The manufacturer of a generic product could challenge our patents as invalid or not infringed and subject us to expensive litigation. We do not know if we would prevail in litigation and succeed in keeping the generic product out of the market until our patent protection expires.\nIf we successfully develop and obtain approval for our product candidates, we will face competition based on the safety and effectiveness of our products, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, the availability and cost of supply, marketing and sales capabilities, reimbursement coverage, price, patent position and other factors. Our competitors may develop or commercialize more effective or more affordable products, or obtain more effective patent protection, than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may commercialize products more rapidly or effectively than we do.\nIf approved, our product candidates will compete for a share of the existing market with numerous approved products.\nWe may have substantial exposure to product liability claims and may not have adequate insurance to pay them.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others. This risk exists for product candidates in clinical trials, whether or not the product candidate is subsequently approved for commercial sale, as well as for products in commercial distribution. Any product liability claim arising in the future against us or any third party that we have agreed to indemnify, regardless of its merit, lack of merit or eventual outcome, would be a significant diversion of our management\u2019s attention from conducting our business and could be costly or materially and adversely affect our reputation or the demand for our products.\nWe have secured product liability insurance coverage in amounts that we believe to be appropriate for our current operations. Our current insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may incur. We expect that we will expand our coverage with respect to any products for which we successfully obtain marketing approval. However, additional insurance may not be available to cover our potential liabilities fully or may be prohibitively expensive. In addition, some potential product liability claims may be excluded from coverage under the terms of the policy. Our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost could prevent or impede the commercialization of our product candidates.\nIf any promotional activities that we undertake fail to comply with the regulations and guidelines of the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities, we may be subject to warnings or enforcement actions that could harm our business.\nPhysicians may prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling or for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications on the subject of off-label use. Companies cannot actively promote approved drugs for off-label uses but may in some jurisdictions and under specified conditions disseminate articles published in peer-reviewed journals that discuss off-label uses of approved products to physicians. To the extent allowed, we may in the future disseminate peer-reviewed articles on our products to physicians. If we undertake any promotional activities in the future for any product candidate for which we receive regulatory approval and our activities fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities.\nRisks Related to Employees\nIf we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional skilled personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates or effectively compete in our industry.\nOur performance depends substantially on the performance of our senior management team, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, Stephen A. Hill, as well as our other scientific, technical and managerial personnel. Our key personnel, including Dr. Hill, can terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of the services of any of our senior management team or other key personnel may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of product development and other business objectives. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, from time to time to assist us in formulating our research and development strategy. All of our consultants and advisors are either self-employed or employed by other organizations, and they may have consulting or advisory contracts with other organizations or other commitments that could limit their availability or otherwise affect their ability to contribute to us.\nPotential future growth of our business and replacement of any key personnel that may terminate their employment with us will depend on our ability to identify, recruit and retain the appropriate personnel. We may have difficulty attracting senior management, scientific and technical personnel as a result of previous workforce reductions and a perceived risk of future workforce reductions. We face intense competition for skilled executives and individuals with relevant scientific and technical expertise in our industry, and this competition is likely to continue. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the success of our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has historically been highly volatile and the Proposed Merger may result in significant stock price and trading volume fluctuations.\nThe trading price of our common stock has historically been highly volatile, and the Proposed Merger may result in significant stock price and trading volume fluctuations. We cannot predict precisely the impact the announcement, pendency or consummation of the Proposed Merger will have on our stock price. Additionally, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. The market prices of securities of pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been extremely volatile and have experienced fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. The Proposed Merger and these broad market fluctuations could result in extreme fluctuations in the price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of shares held by any stockholder.\nIf our operating results fluctuate significantly, our stock price may decline.\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline. Some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, duration, results and cost of clinical trials, as well as non-clinical studies and assessments, of our product candidates and programs;\n\u2022\nour inability, or the inability of any current or potential future collaborator, to successfully complete clinical trials or non-clinical studies and assessments in a timely manner or at all, resulting in a delay in receiving, or a failure to receive, the required regulatory approvals to commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022\nwhether we establish additional strategic alliances, collaborations or licensing or other comparable arrangements, or whether we pursue and complete any merger, acquisition or other significant corporate transaction, and, if we do, the associated terms in each case;\n\u2022\nthe expiration or termination of agreements with any potential future collaborator;\n\u2022\nthe cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals or other regulatory actions;\n\u2022\nthe extent of our general and administrative expenses;\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect the research and development expenditures of any potential future collaborator of ours; and\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical or biotechnology industries or in the U.S. or global credit or financial markets.\nDue to fluctuations in our operating results, a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. For any particular quarter or quarters, our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors and our stock price could decline.\nIf our stockholders sell a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, our stock price may decline.\nOur current trading volumes are modest, and sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price to decline. Such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. If there are more shares of our common stock offered for sale than buyers are willing to purchase, the market price of our common stock may decline to a market price at which buyers are willing to purchase the offered shares and sellers remain willing to sell the shares. The number of shares of our common stock owned by our stockholders and available for sale in the public market is limited only to the extent provided under applicable federal securities laws. In addition, we may, in the future, issue additional shares of our common stock as compensation to our employees, directors or consultants, in connection with strategic alliances, collaborations, acquisitions or other transactions or to raise capital. Accordingly, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time.\nProvisions of our charter and bylaws and Delaware law may discourage or make an acquisition of us or a change in our management more difficult.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. As a result, stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, these provisions could also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions:\n\u2022\nallow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors, providing that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue without stockholder approval blank check preferred stock that, if issued, could operate as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer or otherwise to prevent an acquisition that is not approved by our board of directors;\n\u2022\nrequire that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our board of directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of the holders of 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote in order for the stockholders to amend certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may, unless certain criteria are met, prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a prescribed period of time.", "PERMNO": 91184, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CBIO"}
