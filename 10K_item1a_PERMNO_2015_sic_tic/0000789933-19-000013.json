{"cik": "789933", "company": "NACCO INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nTermination of or default under long-term mining contracts could materially reduce the Company's profitability.\nSubstantially all of NACoal's profits are derived from long-term mining contracts. The contracts for certain of NACoal's unconsolidated mines permit or obligate the customer under some conditions to acquire the assets or stock of the NACoal subsidiary for an amount roughly equal to book value. If any of NACoal's long-term mining contracts were terminated or if any of its customers were to default under material contracts, profitability could be materially reduced to the extent that NACoal is unable to find alternative customers at the same level of profitability.\nThe loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest coal customers or the failure of any of our customers to buy and pay for coal they have committed to purchase could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, NACoal derived over 75% of consolidated revenue from two customers and over 55% of earnings of unconsolidated operations from two customers. There are inherent risks whenever a significant percentage of total revenues are concentrated with a limited number of customers. Revenues from NACoal's largest customers may fluctuate from time to time based on numerous factors, including market conditions, which may be outside of NACoal's control. If any of NACoal's largest customers experience declining revenues due to market, economic or competitive conditions, it could have an adverse effect on the Company's margins, profitability, cash flows and financial position. In addition, if any customers were to significantly reduce their purchases of coal from us, including by failing to buy and pay for coal they have committed to purchase in sales contracts, NACoal's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. During 2017, NACoal's unconsolidated Liberty Mine was placed in cessation due to its customer's decision to suspend operations of its coal gasifier and, in 2018, Liberty permanently ceased all mining and delivery of lignite and commenced mine reclamation. The customer's decision to close the mine did not negatively impact NACCO's earnings for Liberty in 2018, but does unfavorably affect its long-term earning potential from this mine.\nNACoal's unconsolidated mining operations are subject to risks created by changes in customer demand, inflationary adjustments and tax changes.\nThe contracts with the unconsolidated mining operations\u2019 customers are primarily based on a \"management fee\" approach, whereby compensation includes reimbursement of all operating costs, plus a fee based on the amount of coal or limestone delivered. The fees earned adjust over time in line with various indices which reflect general U.S. inflation rates. During the production stage, the unconsolidated mines' customers pay the Company its agreed upon fee only for the coal or limestone delivered to them for consumption or use. As a result, reduced coal or limestone usage by customers for any reason, including,\nbut not limited to, fluctuations in demand due to unanticipated weather conditions, scheduled and unscheduled outages at NACoal's customers' facilities, unplanned equipment failures, economic conditions or governmental regulations or comparable policies which may promote dispatch of power generated by renewables, such as wind or solar, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. Because of the contractual price formulas for the management fees at these unconsolidated mining operations, the profitability of these operations is also subject to fluctuations in inflationary adjustments (or lack thereof) that can impact the agreed upon management fees and taxes applicable to NACoal's income on those fees. In addition, any unfavorable changes in tax laws for mining companies would have a material adverse effect on the Company. These factors could materially reduce NACoal's profitability.\nNACoal\u2019s consolidated mining operations are subject to risks associated with its capital investment, operating and equipment costs, growing use of alternative generation that competes with coal fired generation, changes in customer demand, inflationary adjustments and tax changes.\nThe profitability of the consolidated mining operations is subject to the risk of loss of investment in these operations, changes in demand from customers, increases in the cost of mining and growing competition from alternative generation that competes with coal-fired generation. At MLMC, the costs of mining operations are not reimbursed by MLMC's customer. As such, increased costs at MLMC or decreased revenues could materially reduce NACoal's profitability. Any long-term reduction in customer demand at MLMC would adversely affect NACoal's operating results and liquidity and could result in significant impairments. In addition, MLMC sells lignite at contractually agreed upon prices which are subject to changes in the level of established indices over time. The price of diesel fuel is heavily-weighted among these indices. As such, a substantial decline in diesel prices could materially reduce NACoal's profitability, as the decline in revenue will only be partially offset by the effect of lower diesel prices on production costs.\nNACoal's consolidated operations are subject to changes in customer demand for any reason, including, but not limited to, fluctuations in demand due to unanticipated weather conditions, fluctuations in the construction industry that impact demand for aggregates, the emergence of unidentified adverse mining conditions, availability of alternative energy sources such as wind power or natural gas at reduced prices making coal-fueled generation less competitive with wind power or natural gas-fueled generation, regulations or comparable policies which may promote dispatch of power generated by renewables such as wind or solar ahead of coal, planned and unplanned outages at NACoal's customers' facilities, economic conditions, including economic conditions that adversely affect demand for coal and limestone, governmental regulations, inflationary adjustments and tax risks. In addition, any unfavorable changes in tax laws for mining companies would have a material adverse effect on NACoal's profitability.\nMining operations are vulnerable to weather and other conditions that are beyond NACoal's control.\nMany conditions beyond NACoal's control can decrease the delivery, and therefore the use, of coal to NACoal's customers. These conditions include weather, adverse mining conditions, availability of alternative fuels such as wind power and natural gas at reduced prices making coal-fueled generation less competitive, unexpected maintenance problems and shortages of replacement parts, which could significantly reduce the Company's profitability.\nGovernment regulations could impose costly requirements on NACoal and its customers.\nThe coal mining industry and the electric generation industry are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities on matters concerning the health and safety of employees, land use, permit and licensing requirements, air and water quality standards, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining, the discharge of GHGs and other materials into the environment, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. Legislation mandating certain benefits for current and retired coal miners also affects the industry. Mining operations require numerous governmental permits and approvals. NACoal is required to prepare and present to federal, state or local authorities data pertaining to the impact the production and combustion of coal may have upon the environment. The public, including non-governmental organizations, opposition groups and individuals, have statutory rights to comment upon and submit objections to requested permits and approvals and to legally challenge certain permits subsequent to their issuance. Compliance with these requirements is costly and time-consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of development or production. New legislation and/or regulations and orders may materially adversely affect NACoal's mining operations or its cost structure, or its customers. All of these factors could significantly reduce the Company's profitability. See \u201cItem 1. Business - North American Coal - Government Regulation\" on page 12 in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nNACoal is subject to burdensome federal and state mining regulations and the assumptions underlying the Company's reclamation and mine closure obligations could be materially inaccurate.\nFederal and state statutes require NACoal to restore mine property in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan, and require that NACoal obtain and periodically renew permits for mining operations. Regulations require NACoal to incur the cost of reclaiming current mine disturbance at operations where NACoal holds the mining permit. Estimates of the Company's total reclamation and mine closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and NACoal's engineering expertise related to these requirements. While management regularly reviews the estimated reclamation liabilities and believes that appropriate accruals have been recorded for all expected reclamation and other costs associated with closed mines, the estimate can change significantly if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and could significantly reduce its profitability.\nThe Clean Air Act and Clean Power Plan could reduce the demand for coal.\nThe process of burning coal can cause many compounds and impurities in the coal to be released into the air, including carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, particulates and other matter. The CAA, CPP and the corresponding state laws that extensively regulate the emissions of materials into the air affect coal mining operations both directly and indirectly. Direct impacts on coal mining operations occur through CAA permitting requirements and/or CPP emission control requirements relating to air contaminants, especially particulate matter. Indirect impacts on coal mining operations occur through regulation of the air emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, particulate matter and other compounds emitted by coal-fired power plants. The EPA has promulgated or proposed regulations that impose tighter emission restrictions on a number of these compounds, some of which are currently subject to litigation. The general effect of tighter restrictions is to reduce demand for coal. A reduction in coal\u2019s share of the capacity for power generation could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cItem 1. Business - North American Coal - Government Regulation\" on page 12 in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nNACoal is subject to the high costs and risks involved in the development of new mining projects.\nFrom time to time, NACoal seeks to develop new mining projects. The costs and risks associated with such projects can be substantial. In addition, any changes in tax laws that eliminate the expensing of exploration and development costs will increase the after-tax cost of building a mine and make the cost of coal less competitive with other power-generation fuels.\nEstimates of NACoal's recoverable coal reserves involve uncertainties, and inaccuracies in these estimates could result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs, decreased profitability and asset impairments.\nNACoal estimates recoverable coal reserves based on engineering and geological data assembled and analyzed by internal and, less frequently, external engineers and geologists. NACoal's estimates as to the quantity and quality of the coal in its reserves are updated annually to reflect production of coal from the reserves and new drilling, engineering or other data. These estimates depend upon a variety of factors and assumptions, many of which involve uncertainties and factors beyond NACoal's control, such as geological and mining conditions that may not be fully identified by available exploration data or that may differ from experience in current operations.\nFor these reasons, estimates of the recoverable quantities and qualities attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of net cash flows expected from particular reserves may vary substantially. In addition, coal tonnage recovered from identified reserve areas or properties and revenues and expenditures with respect to NACoal's reserves may vary materially from estimates. Accordingly, NACoal's estimates may vary from the actual reserves. Any inaccuracy in the reserve estimates could result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs, decreased profitability and asset impairments.\nA defect in title or the loss of a leasehold interest in certain property could limit NACoal's ability to mine coal reserves or result in significant unanticipated costs.\nNACoal conducts a significant part of its coal mining operations on leased properties. A title defect or the loss of a lease could adversely affect the ability to mine the associated coal reserves. NACoal may not verify title to leased properties or associated coal reserves until the Company has committed to developing those properties or coal reserves. NACoal may not commit to develop property or coal reserves until the Company has obtained necessary permits and completed exploration. As such, the title to property that the Company intends to lease or mine may contain defects prohibiting the ability to conduct mining operations. Similarly, leasehold interests may be subject to superior property rights of third parties. In order to conduct mining operations on properties where these defects exist, NACoal may incur unanticipated costs. In addition, some leases require the Company to produce a minimum quantity of coal and/or pay minimum production royalties. NACoal's inability to satisfy those requirements may cause the leasehold interest to terminate.\nNACoal has no control over the timing of the development and operation of its natural gas, oil and coal reserves extracted by third parties.\nNACoal is not a natural gas and oil producer. NACoal owns mineral interests and royalty interests in seven states in the continental United States. NACoal derives income from royalty-based leases under which the lessee makes payments to the Company based on the sale of natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil and coal. In recent years, a significant portion of NACoal\u2019s royalty income has been derived from lease signing bonus and production payments associated with NACoal assets in the Utica Shale in Ohio and future royalty-based income is dependent on the number of gas wells being developed and operated on the Company\u2019s mineral acreage in Ohio. The decision to pursue development and operation of oil and gas wells is made by third-party operators, not by NACoal, and depends on a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including fluctuations in commodity prices (primarily natural gas), regulatory risk, the Company's lessees' willingness and ability to incur well-development and other operating costs, and changes in the availability and continuing development of infrastructure. Lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that third-party operators can produce economically. Producing oil and natural gas wells generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. In addition, the rate of production from the Company\u2019s oil and gas interests will decline as reserves are depleted. Any of these risks could materially reduce the Company\u2019s expected royalty income and the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company has experienced growth in its NAM business in recent periods and it may not be able to sustain or manage future growth effectively.\nThe Company has expanded its overall NAM business, operations and headcount in recent periods. NAM\u2019s operating expenses may increase as the Company scales the NAM business, including in expanding sales and marketing capabilities outside of Florida and in providing general and administrative resources to support NAM\u2019s growth. As NACoal continues to grow the NAM business, the Company must effectively integrate, develop and motivate new employees, as well as existing employees who are promoted or moved into new roles, while maintaining the effectiveness of its business execution. In part, NAM\u2019s success depends on its ability to integrate new customers in an efficient and effective manner. The Company may incur costs and capital expenditures associated with future growth prior to realizing the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, may develop more slowly than expected or may never be realized. If the Company is unable to manage this growth effectively, the Company may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities. The Company may also fail to execute on its business plan or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could adversely affect the NAM business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company is dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could significantly reduce its profitability.\nThe Company is highly dependent on the skills, experience and services of its key personnel and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition. Employment and retention of qualified personnel is important to the successful conduct of the Company's business. Therefore, the Company's success also depends upon its ability to recruit, hire, train and retain skilled and experienced management personnel. The Company's inability to hire and retain personnel with the requisite skills could impair its ability to manage and operate its business effectively and could significantly reduce its profitability.\nThe amount and frequency of dividend payments made on NACCO's common stock could change.\nThe Board of Directors has the power to determine the amount and frequency of the payment of dividends. Decisions regarding whether or not to pay dividends and the amount of any dividends are based on earnings, capital and future expense requirements, financial conditions, contractual limitations and other factors the Board of Directors may consider. Accordingly, holders of NACCO's common stock should not rely on past payments of dividends in a particular amount as an indication of the amount of dividends that will be paid in the future.\nNACCO is a smaller reporting company and cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make the Company's common stock less attractive to investors.\nThe Company is currently a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and thus allowed to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures and other decreased disclosure in SEC filings. The reduced disclosures may make it more difficult to compare the Company's performance with other public companies.\nNACCO cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive because of these exemptions. If some investors find NACCO's common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for the Company's common stock and the stock price may be more volatile.\nThe Company\u2019s business could suffer if NACCO\u2019s information technology systems are disrupted, cease to operate effectively or if the Company experiences a security breach, a cyber incident or cyber attack.\nThe Company relies heavily on information technology systems to operate its business record and process transactions; respond to customer inquiries; purchase supplies and deliver inventory on a timely basis; and maintain cost-efficient operations. Given the significant number of transactions that are completed annually, it is vital to maintain constant operation of computer hardware and software systems, implement modifications and/or upgrades as needed and maintain cyber security. Despite the Company's cyber security efforts, the Company\u2019s information technology systems may be vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from computer viruses, power outages, third-party intrusions and other technical malfunctions.\nThrough the Company\u2019s business operations, the Company collects and stores confidential information from its customers and vendors and personal information and other confidential information from its employees. For example, the Company handles, collects and stores information in connection with its customers' businesses and its customers' communications with the Company. Although the Company has taken steps designed to safeguard such information, there can be no assurance that such information will be protected against unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Unauthorized parties may penetrate the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 network security and, if successful, misappropriate such information. Additionally, methods to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information change frequently and may be difficult to detect, which can impact the Company\u2019s ability to respond appropriately. The Company could be subject to liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, for failing to protect personal information or for failing to respond appropriately. Loss, unauthorized access to, or misuse of confidential or personal information could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations, damage the Company\u2019s reputation, and expose the Company to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulators, employees and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches, cyber incidents or cyber attacks could include, among other things, computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing and impersonation), hacking, denial of service attacks and other attacks. Any of these instances could compromise sensitive data, disrupt operations, require additional expenditures for cyber security, increase insurance premiums, cause reputational damage that adversely affects customer or investor confidence and damage the Company's competitiveness, sales, profitability and long-term shareholder value.\nLike many other companies, the Company has been the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts in the normal course of business. Although these prior cyber-attacks have been limited in scope, have not interrupted business operations and have not had a material impact on financial results, this may not continue to be the case in the future. Cybersecurity incidents involving businesses and other institutions are on the rise. The Company believes these incidents are likely to continue and is unable to predict the direct or indirect impact of future attacks or breaches to business operations.\nThe Company may be subject to risk relating to increasing cash requirements of certain employee benefits plans, which may affect its financial position.\nAlthough as of December 31, 2018, the Company's consolidated defined benefit pension plans are frozen and no longer provide for the accrual of future benefits, the expenses recorded for, and cash contributions required to be made to its defined benefit pension plans are dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets, which are dependent on actual investment returns. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the value of plan assets or investment losses on plan assets may require the Company to increase the cash contributed to defined benefit pension plans which may affect its financial position.\nThe Company may become subject to claims under foreign laws and regulations, which may be expensive, time consuming and distracting.\nThe Company is subject to the laws and the court systems of many jurisdictions. The Company may become subject to claims outside the U.S. for violations or alleged violations of laws with respect to past or future foreign operations of NACoal. In addition, these laws may be changed or new laws may be enacted in the future. International litigation is often expensive, time consuming and distracting. As a result, any of these risks could significantly reduce the Company's profitability and its ability to operate its businesses effectively.\nCertain members of the Company's extended founding family own a substantial amount of its Class A and Class B common stock and, if they were to act in concert, could control the outcome of director elections and other stockholder votes on significant corporate actions.\nThe Company has two classes of common stock: Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to cast one vote per share and, as of December 31, 2018, accounted for approximately 25 percent of the voting power of the Company. Holders of Class B common stock are entitled to cast ten votes per share and, as of December 31, 2018, accounted for the remaining voting power of the Company. As of December 31, 2018, certain members of the Company's extended founding family held approximately 35 percent of the Company's outstanding Class A common stock\nand approximately 98 percent of the Company's outstanding Class B common stock. On the basis of this common stock ownership, certain members of the Company's extended founding family could have exercised 82 percent of the Company's total voting power. Although there is no voting agreement among such extended family members, in writing or otherwise, if they were to act in concert, they could control the outcome of director elections and other stockholder votes on significant corporate actions, such as certain amendments to the Company's certificate of incorporation and sales of the Company or substantially all of its assets. Because certain members of the Company's extended founding family could prevent other stockholders from exercising significant influence over significant corporate actions, the Company may be a less attractive takeover target, which could adversely affect the market price of its common stock.", "PERMNO": 28118, "SIC": 1221, "TIC": "NC"}
