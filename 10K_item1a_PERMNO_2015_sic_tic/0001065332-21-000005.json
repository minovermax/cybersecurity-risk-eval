RISK FACTORS\nOur operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described below. If any of these risks occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the value of our common stock could decline substantially.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nBecause we have a limited number of government contracts, the termination or non-renewal of certain of these contracts may harm our business.\nOur enterprise-wide contracts typically have multi-year terms with provisions for renewals for various periods at the option of the government. In addition, we have a limited number of other contracts with government agencies through which we provide digital government services.\nA government typically has the option to terminate its contract prior to the expiration date if we breach a material contractual obligation and fail to cure such breach within a specified period or upon the occurrence of other events or circumstances specified in our contracts.\nWe currently have 14 state enterprise contracts and three software & services contracts under which we provide digital government services that can be terminated by the other party without cause upon a specified period of notice. Collectively, revenues generated from these contracts represented approximately 48% of our total consolidated revenues\nfor the year ended December 31, 2020. If any of these contracts are terminated without cause, the terms of the respective contract may require the government to pay us a fee to continue to use our applications.\nIn addition, we currently have 11 contracts under which we provide enterprise-wide digital government services, as well as our contract with the FMCSA, that have expiration dates within the 12-month period following December 31, 2020. Although certain of these contracts have renewal provisions, any renewal is at the option of our government partners, who may choose to not renew the contract, to re-open bidding for the services, to take over the services in place and provide services internally, or to allow individual government agencies to retain the services of their own providers. Collectively, revenues generated from these contracts represented approximately 28% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. If a contract expires after a defined term, the government partner would be entitled to take over the services in place, and NIC would have no future revenue from, or obligation to, such former government partner, except as otherwise provided in the contract.\nThe loss of a contract with one or more government partners, as a result of the expiration, termination, or failure to renew the contract, if not replaced, could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability. If these revenue shortfalls were to occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition would be harmed. We cannot be certain if, when, or to what extent, governments might fail to renew or terminate any or all of their contracts with us.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had and will continue to have significant impacts on our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures continue to rapidly evolve, creating disruption and uncertainty. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including the duration, scope and severity of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, whether the virus recurs seasonally, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, government partners, citizen consumers and vendors, as well as economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic, and changes in citizen consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may continue in the future.\nThe markets for our COVID-19-related services, including rapid-testing solutions and pandemic unemployment services, are characterized by intense competition, evolving distribution models and disruptive technology developments, among other things, which create downward pressure on pricing and profit margins and could adversely affect our contract renewal rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. Our revenues from COVID-19-related services will depend on the duration and scope of the pandemic, as well as our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing services, introduce new services in a timely and cost-effective manner and meet changing government and citizen consumer expectations and needs, among other things. Some of our competitors and potential competitors for COVID-19-related services enjoy competitive advantages such as greater financial, sales, marketing and other resources, as well as broader brand awareness. As a result of these advantages, potential and current government partners and other clients might select the services of our competitors, causing a loss of our current market share.\nIn response to COVID-19 concerns, we have imposed strict travel restrictions, temporarily closed all our offices and shifted to remote operations to ensure social distancing and the health and safety of our employees which may have negative impacts on our business development efforts. Most of our government partners and potential government partners have implemented similar measures, which may limit our ability to provide or sell our services to them. Our government partners may also have less funding for services, delay or cancel purchasing decisions or projects in light of uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 outbreak, which may reduce our revenues.\nIf one of our key employees or executive officers were to contract an infectious disease that impacts the ability to work for an extended period, even with an adequate succession plan, it could harm our business until that employee or executive officer recovers or until a permanent replacement is found. Hiring and training new employees may require substantial resources and management attention, particularly in a remote workforce environment. Further, because we are self-insured for healthcare, the medical costs associated with treating our employees that contract an infectious disease such as COVID-19 could be significant.\nCOVID-19 has negatively affected economic conditions in the United States and resulted in the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates to near zero, which has reduced the interest income we earn on our investable cash and increased the amount of fees we pay for commercial banking services. Any reduction in the earnings credit rate set by our commercial banking partners, which a bank calculates on non-interest bearing customer deposits and uses to offset service charges, could further increase fees we pay for commercial banking services.\nWe have partnered with third parties to offer and conduct COVID-19 testing on behalf of governmental agencies or other entities, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such testing, which may prevent or delay our ability to seek or obtain additional COVID-19 testing services or otherwise harm our business. If we are not able to maintain these third-party relationships or if these arrangements are terminated, we may have to alter our COVID-19 testing development and commercialization plans.\nWe have partnered with and rely on third-party healthcare providers to offer and conduct COVID-19 testing on behalf of governmental agencies or other entities. We do not plan to independently conduct COVID-19 testing. These third parties play a significant role in COVID-19 testing at the service sites. These third-party arrangements might terminate for a variety of reasons, including a failure to perform by the third parties. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, our COVID-19 testing solution services may be delayed or terminated and hinder our ability to expand such services.\nOur reliance on these third parties for conducting the health care aspects of COVID-19 testing reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we remain responsible for ensuring that our COVID-19 testing is conducted in accordance with the regulatory requirements and the terms of our agreements. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\nIf any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative third parties or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional third-party providers may involve additional cost and require management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new provider commences work. As a result, delays can occur, which could materially impact our ability to continue providing and expanding our COVID-19 testing solution. The COVID-19 pandemic and government measures taken in response have also had a significant impact on many testing service providers. Although we plan to carefully manage our relationships with our third-party providers, we may nonetheless encounter challenges or delays in the future, which could have a material and adverse impact on our COVID-19 testing business and prospects.\nIf we are unable to meet the unique challenges involved in contracting with governments and government agencies, our business may be harmed.\nOur revenues are generated principally from contracts with state governments and government agencies within a state, and to a lesser extent with federal government agencies, to provide digital government services on behalf of those government entities to complete transactions, process payments and distribute public information digitally. We face many risks uniquely associated with government contracting, including:\n\u2022regulations that govern the fees we collect for many of our services, limiting our control over the level of transaction-based fees we are permitted to retain;\n\u2022the potential need for governments to draft and adopt specific legislation before they can circulate a request for proposal (\u201cRFP\u201d) to which we can respond or before they can otherwise award a contract or provide a new digital service, and the risk that enabling legislation previously adopted to establish our contract or to otherwise benefit us could be challenged, reinterpreted, repealed or modified;\n\u2022unexpected changes in legislation that increase our costs or result in a temporary or permanent suspension of our services;\n\u2022the potential need for changes to legislation authorizing government\u2019s contracting with third parties to receive or distribute public information;\n\u2022long and complex sales cycles that vary significantly according to each government entity\u2019s policies and procedures;\n\u2022political resistance to the concept of government agencies contracting with third parties to receive or distribute public information, which has been offered traditionally only by the government agencies and often without charge;\n\u2022changes in government administrations that could impact existing RFPs, rebids, renewals or extensions; and\n\u2022government budget deficits and appropriation approval processes and periods, either of which could cause governments to curtail spending on services, including time and materials-based fees for application development or fixed-fee services, which constituted approximately 7% and 11% of total consolidated revenues, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nEach of these risks is outside of our control and could result in harm to our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nBecause many of our contracts grant our government partners fully paid, perpetual licenses to use and modify certain applications and digital government services we develop, upon a termination by them for cause or the natural expiration of our state enterprise contracts, many of our government partners could elect to take over the operation and maintenance of our applications themselves or hire a competitor to operate and maintain such applications. Any such decision to do so could adversely affect our revenues and profits.\nAfter termination for cause or the natural expiration of our contracts, it is possible that governments and their contractors may operate services themselves using the perpetual use license we typically are contractually obligated to provide to them. This license generally permits the government to use and modify the applications and digital government services we have developed for them on a perpetual, royalty-free basis (excluding certain proprietary applications that we provide on a SaaS basis). This perpetual use license could make it easier and more cost effective for our government partners to elect not to enter into a new contract with us after the expiration of one of our contracts. Any such election could adversely affect our revenues and profits. Additionally, anyone using our applications and digital government services may inadvertently allow our intellectual property or other information to fall into the hands of third parties, including our competitors. If a contract is terminated prior to the natural expiration of the term without cause, the terms of the respective contract typically require the government to pay a fee to us to continue to use our applications in its state.\nOur ability to grow revenues may be limited by the number of governments and government agencies that choose to provide digital government services using our business model and by the finite number of governments with which we may contract for our digital government services.\nOur revenues are generated principally from contracts with state governments and government agencies within a state to provide digital government services on behalf of those government entities, and to complete transactions, process payments and distribute public information digitally. The growth in our revenues largely depends on government entities adopting our business model. We cannot ensure that government entities will choose to provide digital government services or continue to provide digital government services at current levels, or that they will provide such services with private assistance or by adopting our model. Generally, under our enterprise-wide transaction-based business model, we initially generate a high proportion of our revenues from the transaction-based services we provide on behalf of a limited number of government agencies within a state, while other agencies consider participating in the enterprise-wide contract. If any of our partner agencies within a state are dissatisfied with even one of the many services we provide, it may negatively affect our ability to convince additional agencies to partner with us or retain our enterprise agreement. The failure to secure contracts with certain government agencies, particularly those agencies that control motor vehicle driver history records, could result in revenue levels insufficient to support our operations on a self-sustained, profitable basis.\nIn addition, because there is a finite number of states remaining with which we can contract for our services, future increases in our revenues may depend, in part, on our ability to expand our business model to include multi-state cooperative organizations, local governments and federal agencies and to broaden our service offerings to diversify our\nrevenue streams across our lines of business. We cannot ensure that we will succeed in expanding into new markets or broadening our service offerings, or that our services will be adaptable to those new markets.\nWe earn a significant percentage of our revenues and related accounts receivable from a limited number of services and customers. Any reduction in demand for those services or negative trends in the businesses of those customers could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe earn a high proportion of our revenues and related accounts receivable from a limited number of services and customers. A significant portion of our revenues is derived from data resellers\u2019 use of our services to access motor vehicle driver history records for the automobile insurance industry. Transaction-based fees charged for access to motor vehicle driver history records in various states accounted for approximately 19% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. One of these data resellers, LexisNexis Risk Solutions, accounted for approximately 11% of our total consolidated revenues during this period. While fees charged for access to motor vehicle driver history records are currently expected to continue to account for a significant portion of our consolidated revenues for the foreseeable future, regulatory changes or the development or increased use of alternative information sources, such as credit scoring, could materially reduce our revenues from this service. Our contracts with data resellers generally may be terminated at any time after a 30-day notice and may be terminated immediately at the option of any party in certain circumstances. Furthermore, our credit risk may increase in the event any data resellers experience liquidity or solvency issues. We generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable.\nA reduction in revenues from currently popular services or an inability to collect a major portion of our accounts receivable would harm our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition, and our liquidity may be adversely affected.\nIf our competitors become more successful in developing and selling products or platforms for government-related services, including certain vertical and point solutions we offer, then our business could be adversely affected.\nCompanies that have expertise in marketing and providing online services to government entities compete with us by further developing their services and increasing their focus on this area of their businesses. To the extent we can continue to expand our services in existing states and our contracts become more profitable, the competition in our markets may increase. Many of our potential competitors are national or international in scope and have greater resources than we do. These resources could enable our potential competitors to offer lower prices or take other measures to gain market share. Additionally, in some geographic areas, we may face competition from firms with established reputations and political relationships with potential government partners. If we do not compete effectively or if we experience any pricing pressures, reduced profit margins or loss of market share, our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur business will be adversely affected if we are unable to hire, integrate, train, or retain the qualified personnel needed to operate our business.\nOur future success will depend, in part, on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, most of whom have extensive experience with us and in our industry. The loss of any of our executives or key employees, even with an adequate succession plan, could harm our business. In addition, we may need to hire personnel for new operations in jurisdictions in which we may obtain contracts. We may not be able to retain our current key employees or attract, integrate, or retain other qualified employees in the future. If we do not succeed in attracting new personnel, particularly in the competitive market for information technology professionals, or succeed in integrating, retaining, and motivating our current personnel, our business could be harmed. In addition, new employees generally require substantial training in the presentation, policies, and positioning of our services. This training will require substantial resources and management attention.\nIncreases in credit/debit card association and automated clearing house fees may result in lower transaction volumes and/or a reduction in our earnings.\nFrom time to time, credit/debit card and electronic check processors increase the fees (interchange and assessment fees) that they charge companies such as us. We could attempt to pass these increases along to citizens and businesses, but this might result in the loss of those customers or lower transaction volumes. If we are not able to pass along such increased fees to citizens and businesses in the future, we may have to absorb all or a portion of such increases thereby increasing our operating costs and reducing our earnings and profit margins.\nWe depend on third parties, including subcontractors and prime contractors with whom we engage or collaborate for certain projects, deliverables, and/or financial transaction processes. If these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or we are unable to maintain these relationships, our operating results and business prospects could be adversely affected.\nTo satisfy our obligations under contracts, we often engage third parties, including subcontractors, to fulfill certain requirements. We also use third parties to ensure that our services and solutions integrate with the software, systems, or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers. Our ability to serve our clients and deliver our solutions in a timely manner depends on our ability to retain and maintain relationships with subcontractors, vendors, and service providers and the ability of these third parties to meet their obligations in a timely manner, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. If any third-party fails to perform on a timely basis the agreed-upon services, our ability to fulfill our obligations may be jeopardized. Third-party performance deficiencies could result in the termination of our contract for default. A termination for default could expose us to liability for damages and have an adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and our ability to compete for future contracts and orders.\nIn addition, we may act as subcontractor to a third-party prime contractor to secure new projects. Subcontracting arrangements where we are not the prime contractor pose unique risks to us because we may not have control over the customer relationship, and our ability to generate revenue under such subcontracts may depend on the prime contractor, its performance and relationship with the customer, and its relationship with us. We could suffer losses in the event a prime contract under which we serve as a subcontractor is terminated, whether for non-performance by the prime contractor or otherwise. Upon a termination of the prime contract, our subcontract would similarly terminate, and the resulting contract loss could have an adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition and our ability to compete for future contracts and orders.\nWe may be unable to integrate new technologies and industry standards effectively, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality, and features of our services in accordance with industry standards and to address the increasingly sophisticated technological needs of our customers on a cost-effective and timely basis. Our ability to remain competitive will depend, in part, on our ability to:\n\u2022enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality and other features of the government services we offer;\n\u2022continue to develop our technical expertise;\n\u2022develop and introduce new services, applications and technology to meet changing customer needs and preferences; and\n\u2022influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nWe cannot ensure that we will be successful in responding to the above technological and industry challenges in a timely and cost-effective manner. If we are unable to integrate new technologies and industry standards effectively, our business could be harmed.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could harm our company.\nWe regard our intellectual property as important to our success. We rely on a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and policies with governments, our employees, prime contractors, subcontractors, vendors and other third parties, copyrights and privacy and trade secret laws to protect and limit the distribution of the proprietary applications, documentation and processes we have developed in connection with the services we offer. Despite our precautions, third parties may succeed in misappropriating our intellectual property or independently developing similar intellectual property. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information, if we utilize open source software in a manner that places proprietary source code in the public domain, or if we become involved in litigation relating to our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology, our business could be harmed. Any actions we take may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights, and other companies may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technology.\nAny failure to meet our responsibilities or obligations under a contract, regardless of whether there is a claim for which we are liable, may result in damages.\nPerformance deficiencies by us or our third-party vendors, including subcontractors, could result in a default under one or more of our contracts, which could expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our business prospects, on our financial condition, and on our ability to compete for future contracts. If we fail to meet our contractual obligations, if our performance or our third-party vendors\u2019 performance gives rise to claims, if our government partners are otherwise held liable for claims related to the services provided under our contracts, or if our government partners seek to hold us liable for claims or damages for which we have agreed to be responsible for under our contracts, we could be subject to legal liability, monetary damages and loss of customer relationships. Additionally, in many of our contracts, our government partners do not indemnify us from losses related to their performance or non-performance.\nOur business will suffer if we lose the right to provide access to the content filed or distributed through our digital government services or if we are held liable for the content that we pass to users from government entities.\nWe do not own or create the content filed or distributed through the digital government services we operate. We depend on the governments with which we contract to supply information and data feeds to us on a timely basis to allow businesses and citizens to complete transactions and obtain government information. We cannot ensure that these data sources will continue to be available in the future. Government entities could terminate their contracts to provide data. Changes in regulations could mean that governments no longer collect some types of data or that the data is protected by more stringent privacy rules preventing uses now made of it. Moreover, our data sources are not always subject to exclusive agreements, so that data included in our services also may be included in those of our potential competitors. In addition, we depend upon the accuracy and reliability of government computer systems and data collection for the content distributed through the services we operate. The loss, unavailability, or inaccuracy of our data sources in the future, or the loss of our exclusive right to distribute some of the data sources, could harm our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nBecause we aggregate and digitally distribute private and sensitive public information, we may face potential liability for defamation, libel, negligence, invasion of privacy and other claims based on the nature and content of the material that is published on or distributed through the digital government services we operate. Most of the agreements through which we obtain consent to disseminate this information do not contain indemnity provisions in our favor. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against online services in the past. We cannot ensure that our insurance will be adequate to reimburse us for all liability that may be imposed. Any liability that is not covered by our insurance, or is in excess of our insurance coverage, could severely harm our business operations and financial condition.\nWe may need more working capital to fund operations and expand our business, and any failure to obtain such needed working capital would adversely affect our business.\nAlthough we believe that our current financial resources and future cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our present working capital and capital expenditure requirements and potential dividend payments for at least the next 12 months, we may need to raise additional capital before this period ends to further:\n\u2022fund operations, if unforeseen costs or revenue shortfalls arise;\n\u2022support our expansion into other states and federal government agencies beyond what is contemplated if unforeseen opportunities arise;\n\u2022expand our product and service offerings beyond what is contemplated if unforeseen opportunities arise;\n\u2022fund acquisitions;\n\u2022respond to unforeseen competitive pressures; and\n\u2022acquire technologies beyond what is contemplated.\nOur future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the success of our existing and new service offerings and potentially competing technological and market developments. However, any projections of future cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. If current cash, lines of credit and cash generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity securities, issue debt securities, or draw on the unused portion of our line of credit. If we need to obtain new debt or equity financing in the future, the terms and availability of such financing may be impacted by economic and financial market conditions, as well as our financial condition and results of operations at the time we seek additional financing. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. From time to time, we expect to evaluate the acquisition of or investment in businesses and technologies that complement our various digital government businesses. Acquisitions or investments might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to sell additional equity securities or issue debt securities. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If adequate funds were not available on acceptable terms, our ability to develop or enhance our applications and services, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. This limitation could harm our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur quarterly results of operations may be volatile and difficult to predict. If our quarterly results of operations, future growth, profitability or dividend levels fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decrease significantly.\nOur future revenues and results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to several factors, many of which are outside of our control, and any of which may harm our business. These factors include:\n\u2022the commencement, completion or termination of contracts during any quarter;\n\u2022the introduction of new services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022technical difficulties or system downtime affecting the operation of our services;\n\u2022the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our business operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022unexpected changes in federal, state and local legislation that increase our costs and/or result in a temporary or permanent decrease in our revenues;\n\u2022the seasonal use of some of our services, particularly the accessing of motor vehicle driver history records;\n\u2022changes in economic conditions;\n\u2022the result of negative cash flows due to capital investments; and\n\u2022significant charges related to acquisitions.\nDue to the factors noted above and the other factors described in these Risk Factors, our financial performance in a quarter may be lower than we anticipate, and if we are unable to reduce spending in that quarter, our results of operations for that quarter may be harmed. One should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an\nindication of future performance. It is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. If this occurs, the price of our common stock may decline. In addition, if we fail to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends or other market expectations, the price of our common stock may decline.\nOur payment of dividends in the future is subject to several risks and uncertainties, and any failure to pay dividends in the future or any reduction in the amount of future dividend payments may adversely affect our stockholders.\nAlthough our Board of Directors has approved a dividend policy pursuant to which it plans to make, subject to subsequent declaration, regular quarterly cash dividends, the payment of future dividends is subject to several risks and uncertainties, and we may not pay quarterly dividends in the same amounts or at all in the future. Our Board of Directors evaluates our dividend practice quarterly and may elect to increase, decrease or not pay a dividend at any time. Our ability to pay dividends could be affected by future business performance, liquidity, capital needs, alternative investment opportunities and debt covenants associated with our line of credit. Any future determination as to the payment of dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our operating results, financial condition, capital requirements, general business conditions and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant. Any future decisions to reduce or discontinue paying cash dividends to our stockholders could cause the trading price for our common stock to decline and could adversely affect our stockholders.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which are costly to defend and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nWe may become subject to claims alleging infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. Our state enterprise contracts require us to indemnify our government partners for infringing software we build or use. Any claims could subject us to costly litigation and may require us to pay damages and develop non-infringing intellectual property or acquire licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of the alleged infringement. Licenses for such intellectual property may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. Litigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the internet and software industries. We expect third-party infringement claims involving internet technologies and software products and services to continue to increase. If an infringement claim is filed against us, we may be prevented from using certain technologies and may incur significant costs resolving the claim. We cannot ensure that our applications and services do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, we have agreed, and expect that we may agree in the future, to indemnify certain of our partners against claims that our services infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our partners against infringement claims.\nWe depend on technology licensed to us by third parties, and the loss of access to, or improper management of the licensing of this technology could delay implementation of our services or force us to pay higher license fees or fines.\nWe license numerous third-party technologies and applications that we incorporate into our existing service offerings, and on which, in the aggregate, we are substantially dependent. There can be no assurance that the licenses for such third-party technologies will not be terminated or that we will be able to license third-party technology and applications for future services. While we do not believe that one individual technology or application we license is material to our business, changes in or the loss of third-party licenses could lead to a material increase in the costs of licensing, or to our products becoming inoperable or their performance being materially reduced. The result could be that we may need to incur additional development or procurement costs to continue the performance of our services, and either the cost of such undertakings or the failure to successfully complete such undertakings could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Additionally, because of the decentralized nature of our operations, licensing of third-party technology can be complex and difficult to track and continually monitor. Our inability to do so could result in fines, an increase in licensing fees, or the temporary inability to utilize the third-party technology until licensing issues are resolved.\nWe are subject to independent audits as requested by our government customers. Deficiencies in our performance under a government contract could result in contract termination, reputational damage, or financial penalties.\nEach government entity with which we contract may have the authority to require an independent audit of our performance and financial management of contracted operations in each respective state. The scope of audits could include inspections of income statements, balance sheets, fee structures, collections practices, service levels, security practices, and our compliance with contract provisions and applicable laws, regulations and standards. The expansion of our operations into new markets and services may further expose us to requirements and potential liabilities under additional statutes and rules that have previously not been relevant to our business. We cannot ensure that a future audit will not find any material performance deficiencies that would result in an adjustment to our revenues and result in financial penalties. Moreover, any consequent negative publicity could harm our reputation among other governments with which we would like to contract. These factors could harm our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Technology and Cybersecurity\nSecurity breaches or unauthorized access to payment information (including credit/debit card data) personal information (including personal health information) or any other sensitive data subject to state and federal laws that we or our service providers store, process, use or transmit for our business may harm our reputation, cause service disruptions and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA significant challenge to electronic commerce is the secure transmission of payment information and/or personal information over information technology networks and systems which process, transmit and store electronic information, and manage or support a variety of business processes. The collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of payment information and personal information by our businesses are regulated at state and federal levels, and cybersecurity legislation, executive orders and reporting requirements continue to evolve and become more complex. Because we either directly or indirectly through service providers (i) provide the electronic transmission of sensitive and personal information released from and filed with various government entities and (ii) perform online payment and electronic check processing services, we face the risk of a security breach. These security breaches could take place through system attacks, hacking events, acts of vandalism or theft, malware, viruses, human errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events that could lead to significant disruptions or compromises of information technology networks and systems or the unauthorized release or use of payment information or personal information. Additionally, vulnerabilities in the security of our own internal systems or those of our service providers could compromise the confidentiality of, or result in unauthorized access to, personal information of our employees.\nWe rely on encryption and authentication technology purchased or licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication tools to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including user credit/debit card information and banking data. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, threats that evolve ahead of tools designed to counter them, or other developments may result in the breach or compromise of technology used by us to protect transaction data. Data breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, such as so-called \u201csocial engineering.\u201d\nDespite the various security measures we have in place to protect payment and personal information from unauthorized disclosure and to comply with applicable laws and regulations, our information technology networks and systems and those of our third-party vendors and service providers cannot be made completely secure against security incidents. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain vulnerable to security breaches or disruptions, because (i) the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected for an extended period and (ii) the security methodologies, protocols, systems and procedures used for protection are implemented by humans at each level, and human errors may occur. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even if appropriate training is conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur. It is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. A party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent our security measures, or those of our service providers, could misappropriate information, including, but not limited to payment information and personal information, or cause interruptions or direct damage to our partners or their users.\nIn addition, COVID-19 remote work-from-home restrictions make us more dependent on certain technologies that allow us to operate our business remotely and collaborate without face-to-face meetings both internally and with our\ncustomers. To the extent we may experience significant technological disruptions in our work-from-home capabilities, we would anticipate a negative impact on our business operations. Further, to the extent supply chains are disrupted, it may become more difficult to provide necessary technology to our employees working from remote locations.\nIn addition, the increase in certain of our employees working remotely has amplified certain risks to our business, including increased demand on our information technology resources and systems, increased phishing, business email compromise and other cybersecurity attacks, including increased introduction of malware, as cybercriminals try to exploit the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and an increase in the number of points of potential attack, such as laptops and mobile devices (both of which are now being used in increased numbers) to be secured, and any failure to effectively manage these risks, including to timely identify and appropriately respond to any cyberattacks or other disruption to our technology infrastructure, may adversely affect our business.\nUnder payment card rules and our contracts with our credit card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, process, or transmit, we could be subject to fines. We could also be liable to partners for costs of investigation, notification, remediation and credit monitoring and for any damages to users under applicable laws or our partner contracts.\nIn addition, any noncompliance with privacy laws or a security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized access, use or disclosure of payment information or personal information, or other significant disruption involving our information technology networks and systems, or those of our service providers (whether or not caused by a breach of our contractual obligations or our negligence), may lead to substantial costs and other consequences, which may include negative publicity, impair our ability to conduct our business, subject us to private litigation and government investigations and enforcement actions and cause us to incur potentially significant liability, damages or remediation costs, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues, increased insurance premiums and damage to our stock price and long-term stockholder value. It may also cause the governments with whom we contract to lose confidence in us, any of which may cause the termination or modification of our government contracts and impair our ability to win future contracts. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks affecting our own, our service providers\u2019 or our government partners\u2019 environment may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, to train employees, and to engage third-party security experts and consultants. If we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, we may also suffer significant reputational and financial losses and our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected.\nWe could suffer significant losses and liability if our or our service providers\u2019 operations, systems or platforms are disrupted or fail to perform properly or effectively.\nThe continued efficiency and proper functionality of our or our service providers\u2019 technical systems, platforms and operational infrastructure is integral to our performance. As we grow, we continue to purchase equipment and upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on the digital government services we operate. We may experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make digital government services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent businesses and citizens from accessing information to which we provide access and services we operate. Any such interruptions or delays in the future could cause users to stop using the services we operate and could cause our government partners to penalize us financially or terminate agreements with us. Our operations, systems and platforms, or those of our service providers, may also be disrupted or fail due to catastrophic events such as natural disasters, telecommunications failures, power outages, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, acts of war or other catastrophic events. If any of these circumstances occurred, our business could be harmed.\nThe majority of our technology infrastructure and applications are hosted at leased data centers operated by a third-party on servers we own, with a near real-time backup at a similar facility in a different geographic region of the country. Some of our technology infrastructure and applications are physically hosted in each jurisdiction in which we operate on servers that we own or lease, or in a third-party provided cloud environment. Data center servers are virtually segmented by government partner while housing more than one government partner\u2019s services. An outage in one of the servers hosted outside one of the data centers could affect that government partner\u2019s services. An outage at both of our leased data centers, or at one data center and to the connection to our backup facility, could affect more than one government partner\u2019s services. Any of these system failures could harm our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial\ncondition. Our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures of or interruptions in our systems.\nRisks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe may become subject to liability under rules and standards for processing electronic direct debit payments from bank accounts and credit card payments.\nWe are required to comply with the Payment Card Industry\u2019s Data Security Standards (\u201cPCI DSS\u201d) and the rules and standards promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association (\u201cNACHA\u201d) because we provide online payment and electronic check processing services. We may become potentially liable if we fail to handle transactions in accordance with these rules, or for failing to return funds within the prescribed time frame to the bank account of the person or entity disputing our authorization to debit those funds, before the dispute regarding our authorization is resolved. Our agreements with governmental agencies at the federal, state and local levels transfer this obligation for rapid funds return during dispute resolution to the government agencies affected, but in the event that such return does not happen, we may be potentially liable notwithstanding the government\u2019s failure, and we may not be able to obtain reimbursement from the government involved or from the individual user or entity that initiated the debit without authorization. If this were to happen, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected. Our credit card and electronic check processing is also subject to the applicable rules of the card association or clearinghouse and applicable law. Additionally, in certain jurisdictions we are or may become subject to laws governing money transmitters and anti-money laundering for certain services we offer. If our interpretations, or those of our government partners, of any laws, rules, regulations, or standards are determined to be incorrect, we could be exposed to significant financial liability, substantial fines and penalties, cease and desist orders, and other sanctions that could restrict or eliminate our ability to provide certain of our services in one or more states or accept certain types of transactions in one or more states, or could force us to make costly changes to our business practices. If we were unable to accept payment cards or process checks electronically, our business would be negatively impacted.\nWe may become liable for violations of certain privacy laws as adopted federally or in each state.\nWe act as an outsourced manager on behalf of states, for electronic access to records pertaining to motor vehicles and motor vehicle operators (driver history records) by users and certain permitted resellers. These records are the largest group of records for which we process electronic access for state agencies and are processed in most of our state enterprise businesses. These records contain \u201cpersonal information\u201d and \u201csensitive personal information\u201d as defined by the federal Driver Privacy Protection Act, and state versions of that Act adopted in every state (collectively, the \u201cDPPA\u201d). The DPPA regulates categories and circumstances under which \u201cpersonal information\u201d and \u201csensitive personal information\u201d may be disclosed to requesters. Each state has procedures for complying with the DPPA, and such procedures may vary from state to state. We closely follow each state\u2019s compliance procedures for general access. If we fail to follow such procedures, or we grant access to users not in compliance with such procedures, or if such procedures are deemed inadequate in some way, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected. The DPPA permits statutory damages to be awarded to the subjects of such records, even without proof of actual damage, for certain infringements or violations of the DPPA. We may be potentially liable for such damages in such instances, and we may have no recourse against the state.\nSome of our business services involve the collection, transmission and use of an individual\u2019s protected health information or other sensitive personal information, which may be subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\"HIPAA\") or other state privacy and security laws and regulations. In some cases, we also use aggregated and de-identified data as defined by HIPAA for analytical purposes, particularly related to improving the quality of services we provide. At the federal level, HIPAA imposes extensive privacy and security requirements governing the transmission, use and disclosure of health information. These increasingly complex laws, regulations and industry requirements are subject to change and compliance with them may result in significant expenses associated with increased operational and compliance costs, particularly as we continue to offer new services in this field. To the extent that either we or our vendors with whom we share information are found to be out of compliance with such applicable laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, we could be subject to litigation, regulatory risks, reputational harm and damages, fines or penalties. Failure to comply with federal or state statutes or regulations may also result in criminal penalties or civil sanctions.\nOur PSP service for the FMCSA requires that PSP record data be disclosed in compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d) and the Safe, Accountable, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (\u201cSAFETEA-LU\u201d). We may also have other online services that are or become subject to the FCRA and/or SAFETEA-LU. If we fail to follow such procedures, or we grant access to users not in compliance with such procedures, or if such procedures are deemed inadequate in some way, we may become subject to monetary fines, penalties or damages, and our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected. The FCRA and SAFETEA-LU permit statutory damages to be awarded to the subjects of such records, even without proof of actual damage, for certain infringements or violations. In addition, any failure to comply with the FCRA, SAFETEA-LU or other federal laws may result in reputational damage.\nRisks Relating to Conditions in Financial Markets and the Economy\nA prolonged economic slowdown could harm our operations.\nA prolonged economic slowdown or recession could materially impact our operations to the extent it results in reduced demand for internet-based access to digital government services. In addition, it may hinder our efforts to obtain new business by distracting the attention of governments or impairing the ability of governments to hear or act upon our value proposition due to reduced personnel or turnover. These same factors may also jeopardize our renewal or rebid opportunities on existing contracts. If current market and economic conditions deteriorate, we may experience adverse impacts on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur cash could be adversely affected if any of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash fails or becomes subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets.\nOur cash primarily includes cash on hand in the form of bank deposits. We maintain our cash with major financial institutions. Deposits with these financial institutions exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) insurance limits. At December 31, 2020, the amount of cash covered by FDIC deposit insurance was $9.7 million, and $226.8 million of cash was above the FDIC deposit insurance limits. These balances and our liquidity could be affected if one or more of the financial institutions with which we deposit funds fails or becomes subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of adequate access to our cash; however, we can provide no assurance that access to our liquidity will not be impacted or that we will not lose deposited funds in excess of FDIC insurance limits as a result of the failure or insolvency of any these financial institutions or adverse conditions in the financial and credit markets.\nRecent and potential future acquisitions involve inherent risks that may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nTo expand our operations and grow our market and client base, we may seek and complete strategic acquisitions and other business combinations in the future. Acquisitions have inherent risks which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In particular,\n\u2022The pursuit of acquisitions and execution of integration plans may divert the attention of our management from other key responsibilities;\n\u2022We may fail to successfully integrate the business and financial operations, business culture, services, intellectual property, solutions or personnel of an acquired business;\n\u2022We may assume unanticipated liabilities and contingencies;\n\u2022We may substantially reduce our cash position, become significantly leveraged because of incurring debt or issue additional equity to finance one or more acquisitions; and\n\u2022Our earnings per share may be diluted because of acquisitions.\nIf we fail to identify suitable potential acquisition candidates, fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses or to fail to implement our business strategies with respect to these acquisitions, we may not be able to achieve projected results or support the amount of consideration paid for such acquired businesses, and our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 87066, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "EGOV"}
