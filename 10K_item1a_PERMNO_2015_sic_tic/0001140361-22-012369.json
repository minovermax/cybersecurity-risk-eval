You should consider carefully the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before investing in our common stock. The risks described below are those that we believe are the material risks that we face. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could suffer materially, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Operations and Business\nWe may be unable to adequately control the costs associated with our operations.\nWe will require significant capital to develop and grow our business, including developing and manufacturing our fuel cells and building Advent\u2019s brand. We expect to incur significant expenses which will impact our profitability, including research and development expenses, raw material procurement costs, sales and distribution expenses as we build Advent\u2019s brand and market our fuel cells, and general and administrative expenses as we scale our operations. Our ability to become profitable in the future will not only depend on our ability to successfully market our fuel cells and other products and services, but also to control our costs. If we are unable to cost efficiently design, manufacture, market, sell, distribute and service our fuel cells, our margins, profitability and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may need to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available to us when we need them. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected.\nThe scale-up of production of our fuel cells, membranes and electrodes, together with the associated investment in our assembly line and product development activities, will consume capital. While we expect that we will have sufficient capital to fund our planned operations through to breakeven, we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity related or debt securities, or through obtaining credit from government or financial institutions. This capital will be necessary to fund our ongoing operations, continue research, development and design efforts, improve infrastructure, and introduce new technologies. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to manage our future growth effectively, we may not be able to market and sell our fuel cells successfully.\nAny failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We intend to expand our operations significantly. Our future expansion will include:\n\u2022\ntraining new personnel;\n\u2022\nforecasting production and revenue;\n\u2022\ngeographic expansion;\n\u2022\ncontrolling expenses and investments in anticipation of expanded operations;\n\u2022\nentry into new material contracts;\n\u2022\nestablishing or expanding design, production, licensing and sales; and\n\u2022\nimplementing and enhancing administrative infrastructure, systems and processes.\nWe intend to hire additional personnel, including design and production personnel. Because our technologies are different from traditional electric vehicle battery technology, individuals with sufficient training in alternative fuel and electric vehicles may not be available to hire, and as a result, we will need to expend significant time and expense training the employees we do hire. Competition for individuals with experience designing and manufacturing hydrogen fuel cells is high, and we may not be able to attract, integrate, train, motivate or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future. The failure to attract, integrate, train, motivate and retain these additional employees could seriously harm our business and prospects.\nWe will rely on complex machinery for our operations and production involves a significant degree of risk and uncertainty in terms of operational performance and costs.\nWe will rely heavily on complex machinery for our operations and our production will involve a significant degree of uncertainty and risk in terms of operational performance and costs. Our membrane and fuel cell production plant will consist of large-scale machinery combining many components. The production plant components are likely to suffer unexpected malfunctions from time to time and will depend on repairs and spare parts to resume operations, which may not be available when needed. Unexpected malfunctions of the production plant components may significantly affect the intended operational efficiency. Operational performance and costs can be difficult to predict and are often influenced by factors outside of our control, such as, but not limited to, scarcity of natural resources, environmental hazards and remediation, costs associated with decommissioning of machines, labor disputes and strikes, difficulty or delays in obtaining governmental permits, damages or defects in electronic systems, industrial accidents, fire, and seismic activity and natural disasters. Should operational risks materialize, it may result in the personal injury to or death of workers, the loss of production equipment, damage to manufacturing facilities, monetary losses, delays and unanticipated fluctuations in production, environmental damage, administrative fines, increased insurance costs and potential legal liabilities, all which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or prospects.\nOur future growth is dependent upon the market\u2019s willingness to adopt our hydrogen-powered fuel cell and membrane technology.\nOur growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by the automotive, aerospace, power and energy industries. If the market for our fuel cells and membranes does not develop at the rate or to the extent that we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be harmed. The market for alternative fuel and energy storage systems is still new and is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, numerous competitors, evolving government regulation and industry standards and uncertain customer demands and behaviors.\nFactors that may influence the adoption of our fuel cell and membrane technology include:\n\u2022\nperceptions about safety, design, performance and cost, especially if adverse events or accidents occur that are linked to the quality or safety of alternative fuel or electric vehicles;\n\u2022\nimprovements in the fuel economy of internal combustion engines and battery powered vehicles;\n\u2022\nthe availability of service for alternative fuel vehicles;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the cost of energy, oil, gasoline and hydrogen;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency, alternate forms of energy, and regulations banning internal combustion engines;\n\u2022\nthe availability of tax and other governmental incentives to sell hydrogen;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the cost of energy, oil, gasoline and hydrogen;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency, alternate forms of energy, and regulations banning internal combustion engines;\n\u2022\nthe availability of tax and other governmental incentives to sell hydrogen;\n\u2022\nperceptions about and the actual cost of alternative fuel; and\n\u2022\nmacroeconomic factors.\nWe Continue to Generate a Low Level of Revenue from our core product MEA and Developing Commercial Sales to Major Organizations.\nBased on conversations with existing customers and incoming inquiries from new customers, we anticipate substantial increased demand for our MEAs from a wide range of customers as we scale up our production facilities and testing capabilities, and as the awareness our MEA capabilities become widely known in the industry. We expect both its existing customers to increase order volume, and to generate substantial new orders from major organizations, with some of whom it is already in discussions regarding prospective commercial partnerships and joint development agreements. As of December 31, 2021, we were still generating a low level of revenues compared to our future projections and have not made any commercial sales to major organizations.\nFuture product recalls could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nAny product recall in the future may result in adverse publicity, damage our brand and materially adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. In the future, we may voluntarily or involuntarily, initiate a recall if any of our fuel cells or membranes prove to be defective. Such recalls involve significant expense and diversion of management attention and other resources, which could adversely affect our brand image in our target markets, as well as our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key employees and hire qualified management, technical and fuel cell and system engineering personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to retain our key personnel. The unexpected loss of or failure to retain one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business. Our success also depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, attract, train and develop other highly qualified personnel.\nCompetition for these employees can be intense, and our ability to hire, attract and retain them depends on our ability to provide competitive compensation. We may not be able to attract, assimilate, develop or retain qualified personnel in the future, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, including the execution of our global business strategy. Any failure by our management team to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe face various risks related to epidemics, pandemics, and other outbreaks, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of COVID-19, including changes in consumer and business behavior, pandemic fears and market downturns, and restrictions on business and individual activities, has created significant volatility in the global economy and led to reduced economic activity. The spread of COVID-19 has also impacted our potential customers and suppliers by disrupting the manufacturing, delivery and overall supply chain of fuel cell manufacturers and suppliers.\nActions taken around the world to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 include restrictions on travel, quarantines in certain areas and forced closures for certain types of public places and businesses. COVID-19 and actions taken to mitigate its spread have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on the economies and financial markets of many countries, including the geographical area in which Advent operates. For example, In May 2021, Advent\u2019s research and development activities in Boston were limited by the restrictions imposed on laboratory work in the U.S., with laboratories being run at approximately 25% occupancy, with the result that certain business development activities have moved more slowly. Additionally, in Patras, Greece, approximately half of the Company\u2019s workforce have worked from home during the temporary lockdowns imposed by the Greek authorities, although these have largely been in support functions. These measures limit operations in our U.S. and Greece locations and have and may continue to adversely impact our employees, research and development activities and operations and the operations of our suppliers, vendors and business partners, and may negatively impact our sales and marketing activities. We may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, suppliers, vendors and business partners.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business, prospects and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating activities can resume. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience an adverse impact to our business as a result of the global economic impact, including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nThere are no comparable recent events that may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19 and a pandemic, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain.\nIncreases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials could harm our business.\nOnce we increase production, we may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of raw materials. Any such increase or supply interruption could materially negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We use various raw materials including precious group metals such as platinum; carbon black; polymer precursors, reactants, and solvents; as well as carbon cloth and carbon fiber paper. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand and could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe are or may be subject to risks associated with strategic alliances or acquisitions.\nWe have entered into, and may in the future enter into additional, strategic alliances, including joint ventures or minority equity investments with various third parties to further our business purpose. These alliances could subject us to a number of risks, including risks associated with sharing proprietary information, non-performance by the third party and increased expenses in establishing new strategic alliances, any of which may materially and adversely affect our business. We may have limited ability to monitor or control the actions of these third parties and, to the extent any of these strategic third parties suffers negative publicity or harm to their reputation from events relating to their business, we may also suffer negative publicity or harm to our reputation by virtue of our association with any such third party.\nWhen appropriate opportunities arise, we may acquire additional assets, products, technologies or businesses that are complementary to our existing business. In addition to possible stockholder approval, we may need approvals and licenses from relevant government authorities for the acquisitions and to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, which could result in increased delay and costs, and may disrupt our business strategy if we fail to do so. Furthermore, acquisitions and the subsequent integration of new assets and businesses into our own require significant attention from our management and could result in a diversion of resources from our existing business, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our operations. Acquired assets or businesses may not generate the financial results we expect. Acquisitions could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and exposure to potential unknown liabilities of the acquired business. Moreover, the costs of identifying and consummating acquisitions may be significant.\nWe may experience difficulties integrating the operations of acquired companies into our business and in realizing the expected benefits of these acquisitions.\nWe completed the acquisition of SerEnergy and FES on August 31, 2021. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. The success of our acquisition of FES and SerEnergy will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities from combining their and our operations in an efficient and effective manner. These integration processes could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses, tax costs or inefficiencies, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees or other third parties, or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions, and could harm our financial performance. If we are unable to successfully or timely integrate the operations of FES and SerEnergy with our business, we may incur unanticipated liabilities and be unable to realize the revenue growth, synergies and other anticipated benefits resulting from the acquisitions, or fully offset the costs of the acquisition, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to substantial regulation and unfavorable changes to, or failure by us to comply with, these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nOur fuel cells and membranes are subject to substantial regulation under international, federal, state, and local laws. We expect to incur significant costs in complying with these regulations. Regulations related to alternative energy are currently evolving and we face risks associated with changes to these regulations, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nincreased subsidies for corn and ethanol production, which could reduce the operating cost of vehicles that use ethanol or a combination of ethanol and gasoline; and\n\u2022\nincreased sensitivity by regulators to the needs of established automobile manufacturers with large employment bases, high fixed costs and business models based on the internal combustion engine, which could lead them to pass regulations that could reduce the compliance costs of such established manufacturers or mitigate the effects of government efforts to promote alternative fuel vehicles. Compliance with changing regulations could be burdensome, time consuming, and expensive. To the extent compliance with new regulations is cost prohibitive, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe face risks associated with our international operations, including unfavorable regulatory, political, tax and labor conditions, which could harm our business.\nWe face risks associated with our international operations, including possible unfavorable regulatory, political, tax and labor conditions, which could harm our business. We have international operations in Greece that are subject to the legal, political, regulatory and social requirements and economic conditions in these jurisdictions. We are subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell our fuel cells and membranes and require significant management attention. These risks include:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nforeign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements, including foreign taxes that we may not be able to offset against taxes imposed upon us in the U.S., and foreign tax and other laws limiting our ability to repatriate funds to the U.S.;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates;\n\u2022\nU.S. and foreign government trade restrictions, tariffs and price or exchange controls;\n\u2022\nforeign labor laws, regulations and restrictions;\n\u2022\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, natural disasters, war or events of terrorism; and\n\u2022\nthe strength of international economies.\nIf we fail to successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nThe unavailability, reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nAny reduction, elimination or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes, the reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the perceived success of alternative energies or other reasons may result in the diminished competitiveness of the alternative fuel industry generally. This could materially and adversely affect the growth of the alternative fuel automotive markets and our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWhile certain tax credits and other incentives for alternative energy production and alternative fuel vehicles have been available in the past, there is no guarantee these programs will be available in the future. If current tax incentives are not available in the future, our financial position could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to obtain or agree on acceptable terms and conditions for all or a significant portion of the government grants, loans and other incentives for which we may apply in the future. As a result, our business and prospects may be adversely affected.\nWe anticipate continuing to apply for federal and state grants, loans and tax incentives under government programs designed to stimulate the economy and support the production of alternative fuel vehicles and related technologies. We anticipate that in the future there will be new opportunities for us to apply for grants, loans and other incentives from the U.S., state and foreign governments. Our ability to obtain funds or incentives from government sources is subject to the availability of funds under applicable government programs and approval of our applications to participate in such programs. The application process for these funds and other incentives will likely be highly competitive. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining any of these additional grants, loans and other incentives. If we are not successful in obtaining any of these additional incentives and we are unable to find alternative sources of funding to meet our planned capital needs, our business and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may need to defend ourselves against patent or trademark infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and cause us to incur substantial costs.\nCompanies, organizations or individuals, including our competitors, may own or obtain patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights that would prevent or limit our ability to make, use, develop, license or sell our fuel cell and membrane technologies, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. We may receive inquiries from patent or trademark owners inquiring whether we infringe their proprietary rights. Companies owning patents or other intellectual property rights relating to fuel cells may allege infringement of such rights. In response to a determination that we have infringed upon a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may be required to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ncease development, sales, license or use of fuel cells or membranes that incorporate the asserted intellectual property;\n\u2022\npay substantial damages;\n\u2022\nobtain a license from the owner of the asserted intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; or\n\u2022\nredesign one or more aspects or systems of our fuel cells or membranes.\nA successful claim of infringement against us could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. Any litigation or claims, whether valid or invalid, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.\nWe also plan to license patents and other intellectual property from third parties and we may face claims that our use of this in-licensed technology infringes the intellectual property rights of others. In such cases, we will seek indemnification from our licensors. However, our rights to indemnification may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our costs and losses.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we will rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets (including know-how), employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, copyright, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our rights in our technology.\nThe protection of our intellectual property rights will be important to our future business opportunities. However, the measures we take to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use by others may not be effective for various reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nany patent applications we submit may not result in the issuance of patents;\n\u2022\nthe scope of our issued patents may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nour issued patents may be challenged and/or invalidated by our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements or other intellectual property rights may make aggressive enforcement impracticable;\n\u2022\ncurrent and future competitors may circumvent our patents; and\n\u2022\nour in-licensed patents may be invalidated, or the owners of these patents may breach our license arrangements.\nPatent, trademark, and trade secret laws vary significantly throughout the world. Some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Further, policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions may be difficult. Therefore, our intellectual property rights may not be as strong or as easily enforced outside of the U.S.\nOur patent applications may not issue as patents, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others from commercially exploiting products similar to ours.\nWe cannot be certain that we are the first inventor of the subject matter to which we have filed a particular patent application, or if we are the first party to file such a patent application. If another party has filed a patent application to the same subject matter as we have, we may not be entitled to the protection sought by the patent application. Further, the scope of protection of issued patent claims is often difficult to determine. As a result, we cannot be certain that the patent applications that we file will issue, or that our issued patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technology. In addition, our competitors may design around our issued patents, which may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results.\nOur management team has limited experience managing a public company.\nMost members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly-traded company, interacting with public company investors and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituents will require significant attention from our management team and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\nThe SEC released a public statement regarding accounting for warrants which resulted in our warrants being accounted for as liabilities rather than as equity and a restatement of our previously issued financial statements.\nOn April 12, 2021, the staff of the SEC issued a public statement entitled \u201cStaff Statement on Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Warrants issued by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (\u201cSPACs\u201d) (the \u201cStatement\u201d). In the Statement, the SEC staff expressed its view that certain terms and conditions common to SPAC warrants may require the warrants to be classified as liabilities on the SPAC\u2019s balance sheet as opposed to equity. Since issuance, our warrants were accounted for as equity within our balance sheet, and after discussion and evaluation, including with our independent auditors, we have concluded that our warrants should be presented as liabilities with subsequent fair value remeasurement. Therefore, we conducted a valuation of our warrants and restated our previously issued financial statements, which resulted in unanticipated costs and diversion of management resources and may result in potential loss of investor confidence. Although we have now completed the restatement, we cannot guarantee that we will have no further inquiries from the SEC or Nasdaq regarding our restated financial statements or matters relating thereto. Any future inquiries from the SEC or Nasdaq as a result of the restatement of our historical financial statements will, regardless of the outcome, likely consume a significant amount of our resources in addition to those resources already consumed in connection with the restatement itself.\nThe restatement of the Company\u2019s financial statements in May 2021 has subjected us to additional risks and uncertainties, including increased professional costs and the increased possibility of legal proceedings.\nAs a result of the restatement of our financial statements discussed above, we have become subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including, among others, increased professional fees and expenses and time commitment that may be required to address matters related to the restatement, and scrutiny of the SEC and other regulatory bodies which could cause investors to lose confidence in the Company\u2019s reported financial information and could subject the Company to civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation. We could face monetary judgments, penalties or other sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause its stock price to decline.\nCertain of our warrants are accounted for as a warrant liability and are recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value each period to be reported in earnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nFollowing the restatement of our historical financial statements, we account for our warrants as a warrant liability and recorded at fair value upon issuance any changes in fair value each period reported in earnings as determined by the Company based upon a valuation report obtained from its independent third party valuation firm. The impact of changes in fair value on earnings may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nObtaining the MIL-STD certification for the Honey Badger and advancing it for U.S. army integration is subject to risks and uncertainty.\nObtaining the MIL-STD certification for the Honey Badger and advancing it for U.S. army integration is subject to risks and uncertainty, and may not be completed on the timeline the Company expects, or at all.\nCybersecurity risks and attacks, security incidents, and data breaches could compromise our intellectual property or other proprietary information, could disrupt our electronic infrastructure, operations and manufacturing, and could impact our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe rely upon the information technology and data security infrastructure and its capacity, reliability, and security in connection with various aspects of our business activities. We also rely on our ability to expand and continually update these technologies and related infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. We face challenges related to supporting our older technologies and implementing necessary upgrades and the hardening of current technologies. In addition, some of these technologies are managed by third-party service providers and are not under our direct control. If we experience a problem with a critical technology, including during upgrades or new technology implementations, any resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business operations and our performance.\nOur business operations rely upon our electronic infrastructure and that of our third-party vendors, including to handle information and data such as intellectual property, personal information, protected information, financial information and other confidential and proprietary information related to our business and our employees, prospects, customers, suppliers and other business partners. While we maintain certain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards and take preventive and proactive measures to combat known and unknown cybersecurity risks, we currently are building out and maturing our electronic infrastructure and safeguards. There is no assurance that our current controls and our ongoing efforts will be sufficient to eliminate security risks.\nCyberattacks are increasing in frequency and evolving in nature. We and our third-party providers are at risk of attack through use of increasingly sophisticated methods, including malware, phishing, ransomware, and the deployment of technologies to find and exploit vulnerabilities. Our electronic infrastructure, and information technology systems maintained by our third-party providers, have been in the past, and may be in the future, subjected to attempts to gain unauthorized access, disable, destroy, maliciously control or cause other business disruptions. In some cases, it is difficult to anticipate or to detect immediately such incidents and any damage caused. While these types of incidents have not had a material impact on our business to-date, future incidents involving access to or improper use of our systems, or those of our third-parties, could compromise confidential, proprietary or otherwise sensitive information.\nIn addition, cyberattacks could negatively impact our reputation and our competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, significant remediation costs, and loss of business and customers relationships, any of which could adversely impact our business, our financial condition, and our operating results. Although we maintain some insurance coverage, we cannot be certain that coverage would apply to cyber risks, that it may be adequate for liabilities incurred, or that any insurer will not accept or deny coverage of future claims.\nWe may experience problems with the operation of our electronic infrastructure or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, as well as the development and deployment of new electronic infrastructure, that could adversely affect, or even disrupt, all or a portion of our operations until resolved. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic a large percentage of our salaried employees continue to work remotely full or part-time. This remote working environment may pose a heightened risk for security breaches or other disruptions of our information technology environment.\nOur global operations are subject to data privacy laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we may be subject to a complex system of regulatory requirements regarding data privacy, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act and its amendments.\nOur numerous foreign operations are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S. We cannot predict now our future data privacy risks or the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nA write-off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results and net worth.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets are a component of our assets. As a part of our acquisition of SerEnergy and FES on August 31, 2021, we recognized $29.4 million in goodwill and $19.8 million in other intangible assets. As of December 31, 2021, goodwill was $30.0 million and other intangible assets were $23.3 million of our total assets of $163.0 million. We may have to write off all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets if their value becomes impaired. Although this write-off would be a non-cash charge, it could reduce our earnings and our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Warrants\nDelaware law and our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain provisions, including anti-takeover provisions, that limit the ability of stockholders to take certain actions and could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, and the Delaware General Corporations Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to take certain actions, including electing directors or taking other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. Among other things, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions regarding:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock, including \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\nthe limitation of the liability of, and the indemnification of, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that directors may only be removed from our board of directors for cause;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and could delay the ability of stockholders to force consideration of a stockholder proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, our chief executive officer or our president (in the absence of a chief executive officer), which could delay the ability of stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board of directors and stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 65% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of the second amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in our board of directors and also may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to amend the amended and restated bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend the amended and restated bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in our board of directors and also may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of surviving entity.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our board of directors or management.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we will be subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the DGCL, which may generally prohibit certain stockholders holding 15% or more of our outstanding capital stock from engaging in certain business combinations with us for a specified period of time unless certain conditions are met.\nAny provision of the second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control could limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our capital stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nThe second amended and restated certificate of incorporation designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, and also provide that the federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, each of which could limit the ability of our stockholders to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nThe second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on its behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of its directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the second amended and restated certificate of incorporation or the amended and restated bylaws or (4) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. The second amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the federal district courts of the U.S. will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. The exclusive forum provision is applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, subject to certain exceptions. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. We note, however, that there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce this provision and that investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for state and federal courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision. This exclusive-forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find the exclusive-forum provision be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could harm its results of operations.\nWe may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nAlthough we conducted due diligence on Advent, we cannot assure you that this diligence revealed all material issues that may be present in Advent\u2019s business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of our control will not later arise. As a result, the company may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Even if the due diligence successfully identified certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that the company reports charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about the Company or our securities. Accordingly, our stockholders could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the Proxy Statement / Prospectus relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission.\nAn active market for our securities may not develop, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.\nThe price of our securities may vary significantly due to factors specific to our business as well as to general market or economic conditions. Furthermore, an active trading market for our securities may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established and sustained.\nNASDAQ may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur securities are currently listed on Nasdaq. However, we cannot assure you that our securities will continue to be listed on Nasdaq in the future. In order to continue listing its securities on Nasdaq, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and stock price levels. Generally, we must maintain a minimum amount in stockholders\u2019 equity (generally $2,500,000) and a minimum number of holders of its securities (generally 300 public holders). Additionally, we are required to demonstrate compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements, which are more rigorous than Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on Nasdaq. For instance, our stock price would generally be required to be at least $4 per share and its stockholders\u2019 equity would generally be required to be at least $5 million and we will be required to have a minimum of 300 public holders. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at all times.\nIf Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\na limited availability of market quotations for its securities;\n\u2022\nreduced liquidity for its securities;\n\u2022\na determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in the common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u2022\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u2022\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nOur common stock price may change significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile. The stock market recently has experienced extreme volatility. This volatility often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. You may not be able to resell your shares of our common stock at an attractive price due to a number of factors such as those listed in \u201cRisk Factors Relating to Our Operations and Business\u201d and the following:\n\u2022\nresults of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nresults of operations that vary from our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates and investment recommendations by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\ndeclines in the market prices of stocks generally;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint ventures, other strategic relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nany significant change in our management;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in business or regulatory conditions, including new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nguidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;\n\u2022\nthe development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock;\n\u2022\nactions by institutional or activist stockholders;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from pandemics, natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism or responses to these events.\nThese broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low.\nIn the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation. If we were involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.\nBecause there are no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock at a price greater than what you paid for it.\nWe intend to retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and there are no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors. The board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, implications of the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by its subsidiaries to it and such other factors as the board of directors may deem relevant. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nOur stockholders may experience dilution in the future.\nThe percentage of shares of our common stock owned by current stockholders may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including, without limitation, equity awards that we may grant to its directors, officers and employees, or exercise of warrants. Such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our common stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our businesses. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us or our business, the trading price for our common stock could be negatively impacted. In the event securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our securities or publish unfavorable research about our businesses, or if our operating results do not meet analyst expectations, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our common stock price and trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.\nThe sale of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that it deems appropriate.\nAs of March 31, 2022, we have a total of 51,253,591 shares of our common stock outstanding. All shares held by public stockholders prior to the Business Combination and all of the shares issued in the Business Combination to former Old Advent stockholders are freely tradable without registration under the Securities Act, and without restriction by persons other than our \u201caffiliates\u201d (as defined under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, \u201cRule 144\u201d), including our directors, executive officers and other affiliates.\nThe shares of Advent\u2019s common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan will become eligible for sale in the public market once those shares are issued, subject to any applicable vesting requirements, lockup agreements and other restrictions imposed by law. A total of 6,915,892 shares of common stock have been reserved for future issuance under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan. We are expected to file one or more registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock issued pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan. Any such Form S-8 registration statements will automatically become effective upon filing. Accordingly, shares registered under such registration statements will be available for sale in the open market. The initial registration statement on Form S-8 is expected to cover shares of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nAs a public company, we are subject to additional laws, regulations and stock exchange listing standards, which impose additional costs on us and may strain our resources and divert our management\u2019s attention.\nAdvent previously operated on a private basis and following the Business Combination it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of a public company that is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the listing requirements of Nasdaq and other applicable securities laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, which may strain our resources or divert management\u2019s attention.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. We may continue to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We cannot predict whether investors will find securities issued by us less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find those securities less attractive as a result of its reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.\nWe may redeem unexpired public warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous for warrant holders.\nWe will have the ability to redeem outstanding public warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of\u2009 $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of our common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. If and when the public warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right when the registration statement to which this Annual Report forms a part comes into effect with respect to the shares of common stock underlying such warrants. Redemption of the outstanding public warrants could force you to: (1) exercise your warrants and pay the related exercise price at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so; (2) sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants; or (3) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding public warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. None of the placement warrants or working capital warrants will be redeemable by us for cash so long as they are held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees.\nChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAccounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, leases and stock-based compensation, are complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in accounting pronouncements or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance.\nThe exercise of Warrants for our common stock would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 26,369,557 shares of our common stock outstanding. To the extent remaining Warrants are exercised, additional shares of common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the then-existing holders of common stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market or the fact that such Warrants may be exercised could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe valuation of our Warrants could increase the volatility in our net income (loss) in our consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\nThe change in fair value of our Warrants is the result of changes in stock price and Warrants outstanding at each reporting period. The Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities represents the mark-to-market fair value adjustments to the outstanding Warrants issued in connection with the initial public offering of ACMI and the concurrent private placement. Significant changes in our stock price or number of Warrants outstanding may adversely affect our net income (loss) in our consolidated statements of earnings (loss).", "PERMNO": 18302, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "AMCI"}
