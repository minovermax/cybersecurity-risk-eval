Risk Factors.\nForward looking statements and risk factors\nAll statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report, including, without limitation, those statements contained in Item 1, are statements that constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The words \u201cexpect\u201d, \u201cestimate\u201d, \u201canticipate\u201d, \u201cpredict\u201d, \u201cbelieve\u201d and similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements appear in a number of places in this report and include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of the Company, its directors or its officers with respect to, among other things: (i) trends affecting the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition, results of\noperations or cash flows; (ii) the Company\u2019s financing plans; (iii) the Company\u2019s business and growth strategies, including potential acquisitions; and (iv) other plans and objectives for future operations. Investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those predicted in the forward-looking statements or which may be anticipated from historical results or trends.\nOur Company operates in technology-based markets that involve a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. The following discussion highlights some risks and uncertainties that investors should consider, in conjunction with all other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company may impair the Company\u2019s business and operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company\u2019s business, consolidated financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be materially affected.\nHistory of losses and declining liquidity\nDeclining liquidity and lack of credit availability could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\ngenerating insufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our payment obligations;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flow for operating activities and as a result reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, capitalize on future business opportunities and expand our business and execute our strategy;\n\u2022\ncausing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and to react to competitive pressure and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have access to a line of credit.\nChanges in government priorities may affect military spending, and our consolidated financial condition and results of operations or cash flows could suffer if their purchases decline.\nWe currently derive a portion of our net sales (52% in fiscal 2020) from direct and indirect sales to the U.S. government. If we are unable to replace expiring contracts, which are typically less than twelve months in duration, with contracts for new business, our sales could decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. We expect that direct and indirect sales to the U.S. government will continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales in the foreseeable future. We have no assurance that these government-related sales will continue to reach or exceed historical levels in future periods.\nOur inability to secure financing could negatively affect the future of our business.\n\u2022\nOur inability to secure financing with our current bank or others, if necessary, could expose us to the risk of losing business; and\n\u2022\nOur inability to secure financing with a commercial bank could expose us to the risk of increased interest rates.\nOur industry is highly competitive and competitive conditions may adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to compete in markets that are highly competitive, with rapid technological advances and products that require constant improvement in both price and performance. In most of our markets, we are experiencing increased competition, and we expect this trend to continue. This environment may result in changes in relationships with customers or vendors, the ability to develop new relationships, or the business failure of customers or vendors, which may negatively affect our business. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing new technology and products, our business may be adversely affected.\nCompetitive pressures may increase or change through industry consolidation, entry of new competitors, marketing changes or otherwise. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to compete effectively with existing or potential competitors.\nCompetitors or third-parties may infringe on our intellectual property.\nThe Company holds patents with respect to certain products and services. The Company also sells products under various trademarks and trade names. Should competitors or third-parties infringe on these rights, costly legal processes may be required to defend our intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our business.\nMigration to flat panel and other technology may negatively affect our CRT business.\nThe Company acquires CRT inventory when the replacement market appears to demonstrate adequate future demand and the purchase price allows a reasonable profit for the risk. Due to the extended time frame for the replacement market to develop (five to seven years), these purchased inventories may not sell as quickly as other inventories. If the Company is unable to manage CRT inventory levels in coordination with reduced future CRT demand due to the growth of flat panel technology, the marketability of inventory on hand may be affected and the Company may incur significant costs in the disposal of excess inventory.\nThe Company anticipates that flat panel and other technology products, due to their lower space and power requirements, has become the display of choice in many display applications. Given this shift, the Company has focused its efforts and its acquisition strategy toward flat panel technologies. If the Company is unable to replace any future declines in CRT sales with products based on other technologies, our business may be adversely affected.\nFuture acquisitions may not provide benefits to the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s growth strategy includes expansion through acquisitions that enhance the profitability and shareholder value of the Company. The Company continues to seek new products through acquisitions and internal development that complement existing profitable product lines. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete further acquisitions or that past or future acquisitions will not have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated operations.\nIf we are unable to retain certain key personnel and hire new, highly-skilled personnel, we may not be able to execute our business plan.\nOur future success depends on the skills, experience, and efforts of our senior managers. The loss of services of any of these individuals, or our inability to attract and retain qualified individuals for key management positions, could negatively affect our business.\nOur business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately.\nWe depend upon our information technology systems in the conduct of our operations and financial reporting. If our major information systems fail to perform as anticipated, we could experience difficulties in maintaining normal business operations. Such systems-related problems could adversely affect product development, sales, and profitability.\nOur business operations could be adversely impacted by the effects of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) or any other related adverse public health developments.\nThe risk of the Coronavirus to our employees, customers and supply chain could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business due to threat of illness, quarantines, restrictions of movement and closures of key customers and suppliers.\nWe may not be entitled to forgiveness of our recently received PPP Loan, and our application for the PPP Loan could in the future be determined to have been impermissible or could result in damage to our reputation.\nIn April 2020, we received proceeds of approximately $1.0 million from a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act, a portion of which may be forgiven, which we intend to use to retain employees, maintain payroll and make lease and utility payments. A portion of the PPP Loan may be forgiven by the SBA upon our application beginning 60 days but not later than 120 days after loan approval and upon documentation of expenditures in accordance with the SBA requirements. Under the CARES Act, loan forgiveness is available for the sum of documented payroll costs, covered rent payments, covered mortgage interest and covered utilities during the eight week period beginning on the date of loan approval. Not more than 25% of the forgiven amount may be for non-\npayroll costs. The amount of the PPP Loan eligible to be forgiven is reduced if our full-time headcount declines or if salaries and wages for employees with salaries of $100,000 or less annually are reduced by more than 25%. We will be required to repay any portion of the outstanding principal that is not forgiven, along with accrued interest, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be eligible for loan forgiveness or that any amount of the PPP Loan will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA.\nIn order to apply for the PPP Loan, we were required to certify, among other things, that the current economic uncertainty made the PPP Loan request necessary to support our ongoing operations. We made this certification in good faith after analyzing, among other things, our financial situation and access to alternative forms of capital, and believe that we satisfied all eligibility criteria for the PPP Loan, and that our receipt of the PPP Loan is consistent with the broad objectives of the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act. The certification described above does not contain any objective criteria and is subject to interpretation. However, on April 23, 2020, the SBA issued guidance stating that it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith. The lack of clarity regarding loan eligibility under the Paycheck Protection Program has resulted in significant media coverage and controversy with respect to public companies applying for and receiving loans. If, despite our good-faith belief that we satisfied all eligible requirements for the PPP Loan, we are later determined to have violated any of the laws or governmental regulations that apply to us in connection with the PPP Loan, such as the False Claims Act, or it is otherwise determined that we were ineligible to receive the PPP Loan, we may be subject to penalties, including significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, and could be required to repay the PPP Loan in its entirety. In addition, our receipt of the PPP Loan may result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation, and a review or audit by the SBA or other government entity or claims under the False Claims Act could consume significant financial and management resources.\nChanges to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our results of operations.\nNew accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future. Future changes to accounting rules or regulations or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price may be negatively affected by a variety of factors.\nIn addition to any impact the Company\u2019s operating performance, potential future Company sales or repurchases of common stock, the Company\u2019s dividend policies or possible anti-takeover measures available to the Company may have, changes in securities markets caused by general foreign or domestic economic, consumer or business trends, the impact of interest rate policies by the federal reserve board, and other factors outside the Company\u2019s control may negatively affect our stock price.\nOur stock may be traded infrequently and in low volumes, so you may be unable to sell your shares at or near the quoted bid price if you need to sell your shares.\nOur stock is quoted on the OTC Markets and the shares of our common stock may trade infrequently and in low volumes, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. An investor may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock or to sell his or her shares at or near bid prices, if at all.\nChanges to estimates, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates, may cause us to incur impairment charges.\nIf the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, then it applies the processes prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 360 \u201cProperty, Plant, and Equipment.\u201d We make certain estimates and projections in connection with our impairment analyses for other long-term assets. If these estimates or projections change or prove incorrect, we may be required to record impairment charges. If these impairment charges were significant, our consolidated financial position or results of operations would be adversely affected.\nInternational factors could negatively affect our business.\nA significant portion of our consolidated net sales (11% in fiscal 2020) is made to foreign customers. We also receive a significant amount of our raw materials from foreign vendors. We are subject to the risks inherent in conducting our business across national boundaries, many of which are outside of our control. These risks include the following:\n\u2022\nEconomic downturns;\n\u2022\nCurrency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nChanges in governmental policy or laws including, among others, those relating to taxation;\n\u2022\nInternational military, political, diplomatic and terrorist incidents;\n\u2022\nGovernment instability;\n\u2022\nNationalization of foreign assets;\n\u2022\nNatural disasters; and\n\u2022\nTariffs and governmental trade policies.\nWe cannot ensure that one or more of these factors will not negatively affect our international customers and, as a result, our business and consolidated financial performance.", "PERMNO": 92874, "SIC": 3670, "TIC": "VIDE"}
