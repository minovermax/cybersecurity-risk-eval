RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our company involves various risks, including the risk that you might lose your entire investment. Our results of operations depend upon many factors including our ability to implement our business strategy, the availability of opportunities to acquire assets, the level and volatility of interest rates, the cost and availability of short- and long-term credit, financial market conditions and general economic conditions.\nThe following discussion concerns the material risks associated with our business. These risks are interrelated, and you should consider them as a whole. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us may also materially and adversely affect the value of our capital stock and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. In connection with the forward-looking statements that appear in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including these risk factors and elsewhere, you should carefully review the section entitled \u201cCautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Information.\u201d\nRisks Related to our Principal Investing Activities\nChanges in interest rates and adverse market conditions could negatively affect the value of our MBS investments and increase the cost of our borrowings, which could result in reduced earnings or losses and negatively affect the cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nWe acquire indirect interests in mortgage loans by purchasing MBS, and we currently intend to continue this strategy. Under a normal yield curve, an investment in MBS will decline in value if long-term interest rates increase. In addition, net interest income could decrease if the yield curve becomes inverted or flat. Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac guarantees of the agency MBS we own do not protect us from declines in market value caused by changes in interest rates. Declines in market value may ultimately reduce earnings or result in losses to us, which may negatively affect cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nA significant risk associated with our portfolio of mortgage-related assets is the risk that both long-term and short-term interest rates will increase significantly. If long-term rates were to increase significantly, the market value of these MBS would decline and the duration and weighted average life of these MBS would increase. We could realize a loss in the future if the MBS in our portfolio are sold. With respect to the other end of the yield curve, an increase in short-term interest rates would increase the financing costs on the repurchase agreements we enter into in order to finance the purchase of MBS, thereby decreasing net interest margin if all other factors remain constant.\nMarket values of MBS may decline without any general increase in interest rates for a number of reasons, such as increases in default of the mortgages underlying such MBS, increases in voluntary prepayments of the mortgages underlying such MBS and widening of credit spreads. If the market values of our investments were to decline for any reason, the value of your investment in our securities could also decline.\nHedging against interest rate exposure may not completely insulate us from interest rate risk and may adversely affect our earnings, which could adversely affect cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nWe engage in certain hedging transactions to limit our exposure from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates on our short-term financing agreements and our net book value, and therefore may expose our company to the risks associated with such transactions. We have historically entered into and may enter into interest rate swap agreements, Eurodollar futures, interest rate swap futures, U.S. Treasury note futures, put options or pursue other hedging strategies. Our hedging activities are generally designed to limit certain exposures and not to eliminate them. Hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. Such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the portfolio positions should increase. Moreover, it may not be possible to hedge against an interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we are not able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price.\nThere are no perfect hedging strategies, and interest rate hedging may fail to protect us from loss. The success of our hedging transactions depends on our ability to accurately predict movements of interest rates and credit spreads. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged may vary. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. Furthermore, our hedging strategies may adversely affect us because hedging activities involve costs that we incur regardless of the effectiveness of the hedging activity, which may decrease our net interest margin. Our hedging activity will vary in scope based on the level and volatility of interest rates and principal prepayments, the amount of leverage, the type of MBS held, and other changing market conditions.\nInterest rate hedging may fail to protect or could adversely affect us because, among other things:\n\u2022 interest rate hedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of rising and volatile interest rates;\n\u2022 available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought;\n\u2022 the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related asset or liability;\n\u2022 the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction; and\n\u2022 the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay.\nOur hedging activity may adversely affect our earnings and result in volatile fluctuations in the fair value of our hedges, net income and book value per share, which could adversely affect cash available for distribution to our shareholders and the value of your investment in our securities.\nOur hedging strategies are generally not designed to mitigate spread risk.\nWhen the market spread widens between the yield on our assets and benchmark interest rates, our net book value could decline if the value of our assets falls by more than the offsetting fair value increases on our hedging instruments tied to the underlying benchmark interest rates. We refer to this scenario as an example of \u201cspread risk\u201d or \u201cbasis risk.\u201d The spread risk associated with our mortgage assets and the resulting fluctuations in fair value of these securities can occur independently of changes in benchmark interest rates and may relate to other factors impacting the mortgage and fixed income markets, such as actual or anticipated monetary policy actions by the Federal Reserve, market liquidity, or changes in required rates of return on different assets. Consequently, while we use interest rate swap agreements, Eurodollar futures, U.S. Treasury note futures, put options and interest rate swap futures and other supplemental hedges to attempt to protect against moves in interest rates, such instruments typically will not protect our net book value against spread risk, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDeclines in the market values of our MBS portfolio may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and market price of our Class A common stock or Senior Notes.\nOur MBS investments are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reported in either net income or other comprehensive income. As a result, a decline in the fair value of our investments would reduce our net income and book value per share. Fair values for our MBS investments can be volatile. The fair values can change rapidly and significantly and changes can result from various factors, including changes in interest rates, actual and perceived risk, supply, demand, expected prepayment rates, and actual and projected credit performance. Declines in the market values of our MBS portfolio would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and market price of our Class A common stock or Senior Notes.\nOur mortgage investing strategy involves leverage, which could adversely affect our operations and negatively affect cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nWe may increase our investment exposure in MBS or other investment opportunities by funding a portion of those acquisitions with repurchase agreements or other borrowing arrangements. To the extent that revenue derived from such levered assets exceeds our interest expense, hedging expense and other costs of the financing, our net income will be greater than if we had not borrowed funds and had not invested in such assets on a leveraged basis. Conversely, if the revenue from our MBS does not sufficiently cover the interest expense, hedging expense and other costs of the financing, our net income will be less or our net loss will be greater than if we had not borrowed funds. Because of the credit and interest rate risks inherent in our strategy, we closely monitor the leverage of our MBS portfolio. From time to time, our leverage ratio may increase or decrease due to several factors, including changes in the value of the underlying portfolio holdings and the timing and amount of acquisitions.\nAn increase in our borrowing costs relative to the interest we receive on our assets may impair our profitability and thus our cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nAs our repurchase agreements and other short-term borrowings mature, we must either enter into new borrowings or liquidate certain of our investments at times when we might not otherwise choose to do so. Lenders may also seek to use a maturity date as an opportune time to demand additional terms or increased collateral requirements that could be adverse to us and harm our operations. Due to the short-term nature of our repurchase agreements used to finance our MBS investments, our borrowing costs are particularly sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. An increase in short-term interest rates when we seek new borrowings would reduce the spread between our returns on our assets and the cost of our borrowings. This would reduce the returns on our assets, which might reduce earnings and in turn cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nDifferences in the stated maturity of our fixed-rate assets and short-term borrowings may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe rely primarily on short-term, variable rate borrowings to acquire fixed-rate securities with long-term maturities. The relationship between short-term and longer-term interest rates is often referred to as the \u201cyield curve.\u201d Ordinarily, short-term interest rates are lower than longer-term interest rates. If short-term interest rates rise disproportionately relative to longer-term interest rates, resulting in a \u201cflattening\u201d of the yield curve, our borrowing costs may increase more rapidly than the interest income earned on our assets. Because our investments generally bear interest at longer-term rates than we pay on our borrowings under our repurchase agreements, a flattening of the yield curve would tend to decrease our net interest income and the market value of our investment portfolio. Additionally, to the extent cash flows from investments that return scheduled and unscheduled principal are reinvested, the spread between the yields on the new investments and available borrowing rates may decline, which would likely decrease our net income. It is also possible that short-term interest rates may exceed longer-term interest rates (a yield curve \u201cinversion\u201d), in which event our borrowing costs may exceed our interest income, we could incur operating losses, and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders could be hindered.\nOur lenders may require us to provide additional collateral, especially when the market values for our investments decline, which may restrict us from leveraging our assets as fully as desired, and reduce our liquidity, earnings and cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nWe currently use repurchase agreements to finance our investments in MBS. Our repurchase agreements allow the lenders, to varying degrees, to determine a new market value of the collateral to reflect current market conditions. If the market value of the securities pledged or sold by us to a funding source declines in value, we may be required by the lender to provide additional collateral or pay down a portion of the funds advanced on minimal notice, which is known as a margin call. Posting additional collateral will reduce our liquidity and limit our ability to leverage our assets, which could adversely affect our business. Additionally, in order to satisfy a margin call, we may be required to liquidate assets at a disadvantageous time, which could cause us to incur further losses and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and may impair our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. In the event we do not have sufficient liquidity to satisfy these margin calls, lending institutions can accelerate our indebtedness, increase our borrowing rates, liquidate our collateral and terminate our ability to borrow. Such a situation would likely result in a rapid deterioration of our financial condition and possibly necessitate a filing for protection under the bankruptcy code.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate financing through repurchase agreements or to renew or replace existing borrowings upon maturity, we will be limited in our ability to implement our principal investing activities, which will adversely affect our results of operations and may, in turn, negatively affect the market value of our Class A common stock or Senior Notes and our ability to make dividends to our shareholders.\nWe depend upon repurchase agreement financing to purchase our target assets and reach our target leverage ratio. We cannot assure you that sufficient repurchase agreement financing will be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us. Investors and financial institutions that lend in the securities repurchase market have tightened lending standards and some have stopped lending entirely in the repurchase market in response to regulatory capital requirements imposed upon our lenders and the difficulties and changed economic conditions that have materially adversely affected the MBS market. Our lenders also may revise their eligibility requirements for the types of assets they are willing to finance or the terms of such financings based on, among other factors, the regulatory environment and their perceived risk. If we fail to obtain adequate funding or to renew or replace existing funding upon maturity, we will be limited in our ability to implement our business strategy, which will adversely affect our results of operations and may, in turn, negatively affect the market value of our Class A common stock or Senior Notes and our ability to make dividends to our shareholders.\nAdoption of the Basel III standards and other proposed supplementary regulatory standards may negatively impact our access to financing or affect the terms of our future financing arrangements.\nIn response to various financial crises and the volatility of financial markets, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision adopted the Third Basel Accord (\u201cBasel III\u201d), a global, voluntary framework to strengthen the regulation, supervision, and risk management of the banking sector focusing on bank capital adequacy, stress testing and market liquidity risk. U.S. regulators have elected to implement substantially all of the Basel III standards. Financial institutions will have until 2019 to fully comply with the Basel III standards, which could cause an increase in capital requirements for, and could place constraints on, the financial institutions from which we borrow.\nIn April 2014, U.S. regulators adopted rules requiring enhanced supplemental leverage ratio standards beginning in January 2018, which would impose capital requirements more stringent than those of the Basel III standards. These supplemental regulatory standards adopted by U.S. regulators may negatively impact our access to financing or affect the terms of our future financing arrangements.\nNew assets we acquire may not generate yields as attractive as yields on our current assets, resulting in a decline in our earnings over time.\nWe receive monthly cash flows consisting of principal and interest payments from many of our assets. Principal payments reduce the size of our current portfolio (i.e., reduce the amount of our long-term assets) and generate cash for us. We may also sell assets from time to time as part of our portfolio management and capital reallocation strategies. In order to maintain and grow our portfolio size and our earnings, we must reinvest in new assets a portion of the cash flows we receive from principal and interest payments and asset sales. New investment opportunities may not generate the same investment returns as our current investment portfolio. If the assets we acquire in the future earn lower returns than the assets we currently own, our reported earnings will likely decline over time as the older assets pay down, are called, or are sold.\nClearing facilities or exchanges upon which some of our hedging instruments are traded may increase margin requirements on our hedging instruments in the event of adverse economic developments.\nOur hedging agreements typically require that we pledge collateral on such agreements. Our exchange-traded derivatives, such as Eurodollar futures, interest rate swap futures and U.S. Treasury note futures, are, in effect, settled on a daily basis by the exchange of cash variation margin. For our centrally cleared interest rate swaps, the clearing exchange has the sole discretion to determine the value of interest rate swaps and the value of the collateral required to secure such instruments. In the event of a margin call of our centrally cleared interest rate swaps, we must generally pledge additional collateral on the same business day. In response to events having or expected to have adverse economic consequences or which create market uncertainty, clearing facilities or exchanges upon which our hedging instruments are traded may require us to pledge additional collateral against our hedging instruments. In the event that future adverse economic developments or market uncertainty result in increased margin requirements for our hedging instruments, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity position, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and related efforts, along with any changes in laws and regulations affecting the relationship between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the federal government, may adversely affect our business.\nThe agency MBS in which we invest depend on a steady stream of payments on the mortgages underlying the MBS. The interest and principal payments we receive on the agency MBS that we acquire are guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are GSEs, but their guarantees are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\nIn response to the general market instability, and more specifically, the financial condition of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 established the FHFA as the new regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In 2008, the FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship, which is a statutory process pursuant to which the FHFA operates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in an effort to stabilize the entities. The FHFA, together with the U.S. Treasury and the U.S. Federal Reserve, has also undertaken actions designed to boost investor confidence in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, support the availability of mortgage financing and protect taxpayers. As part of these actions, the U.S. Treasury has agreed to support the continuing operations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with any necessary capital contributions while in conservatorship. Although the U.S. Treasury has committed to support the positive net worth of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two GSEs could default on their guarantee obligations, which would materially and adversely affect the value of our agency MBS.\nShortly after Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed in federal conservatorship, the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, in announcing the actions, noted that the guarantee structure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac required examination and that change in the structures of the entities were necessary to reduce risk to the financial system. The future roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could be significantly reduced and the nature of their guarantees could be eliminated or considerably limited relative to historical measurements. Any changes to the nature of the guarantees provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could redefine what constitutes agency MBS, have broad adverse market implications and negatively impact us.\nBased on various legislative proposals, significant differences in views appear to exist within Congress regarding housing finance reform. It is unclear which, if any, of these proposals will be enacted, when, if ever, they will be enacted, and, if any are enacted, what the effects would be. It is possible that the 2016 election may result in meaningful housing finance debate and reform to occur, while it is also possible that the status quo will prevail for some time to come.\nIn September 2015, the FHFA issued a progress report on the initiatives outlined in the Strategic Plan for the Enterprise Conservatorships detailing important progress toward the building of a new secondary mortgage market infrastructure. According to the progress report, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have made some progress in developing the common securitization infrastructure (\u201cCSP\u201d). The FHFA has also established an independent corporate entity, Common Securitization Solutions, LLC, that will develop, build, own, and operate the CSP. While some progress has been made in developing the CSP, the project faces considerable challenges that could undermine its prospects for success, including: (i) the difficulties inherent in developing a large-scale information technology system and (ii) the risks involved with preparing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to integrate with the CSP, including modifying internal financial and information systems. If such initiatives are achieved, it is unclear what the effects might be.\nLegislation has changed the relationship between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the U.S. government and requires Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to reduce the amount of mortgage loans they own or the amount of agency MBS for which they provide guarantees. The passage of any additional new legislation affecting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may create market uncertainty and reduce the actual or perceived credit quality of securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government through a new or existing successor entity to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. If the charters of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were revoked, it is unclear what effect, if any, this would have on the value of the existing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agency MBS. It is also possible that the above-referenced proposed legislation, if made law, could adversely impact the market for securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government and the spreads at which they trade. The foregoing could materially adversely affect the pricing, supply, liquidity and value of our target assets and otherwise materially adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nIf Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac were eliminated, or their structures were to change radically, we may not be able to acquire agency MBS from these companies, which could drastically reduce the amount and type of agency MBS available for investment, thereby increasing the price of these assets. Additionally, the current credit support provided by the U.S. Treasury to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and any additional credit support it may provide in the future, could have the effect of lowering the interest rate we receive from agency MBS, thereby tightening the spread between the interest we earn on our portfolio and our financing costs. Additionally, the U.S. government could elect to stop providing credit support of any kind to the mortgage market. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders could be materially adversely affected.\nTo the extent that we invest in agency MBS that are guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we are subject to the risk that these GSEs may not be fully able to satisfy their guarantee obligations or that these guarantee obligations may be repudiated, which would adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and our ability to sell or finance these securities.\nAll of the agency MBS in which we invest depend on a steady stream of payments on the mortgages underlying the MBS. The interest and principal payments we receive on agency MBS issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac are guaranteed by these GSEs, but are not guaranteed by the U.S. government. To the extent these GSEs are not able to fully satisfy their guarantee obligations or that these guarantee obligations are repudiated or otherwise defaulted upon, the value of our investment portfolio and our ability to sell or finance these securities would be adversely affected.\nMarket conditions and actions by governmental authorities may disrupt the historical relationship between interest rate changes and prepayment trends, which would make it more difficult for us to analyze our investment portfolio.\nOur success depends on our ability to analyze the relationship of changing interest rates on prepayments of the mortgage loans that underlie our MBS. Changes in interest rates and prepayments affect the market price of MBS that we intend to purchase and any MBS that we hold at a given time. As part of our overall portfolio risk management, we analyze interest rate changes and prepayment trends separately and collectively to assess their effects on our investment portfolio. In conducting our analysis, we depend on certain assumptions based upon historical trends with respect to the relationship between interest rates and prepayments under normal market conditions. If recent or future government actions or other developments change the way that prepayment trends have historically responded to interest rate changes, our ability to (i) assess the market value of our investment portfolio, (ii) implement our hedging strategies and (iii) implement techniques to reduce our prepayment rate volatility would be significantly affected. If we are unable to accurately forecast interest and prepayment rates, our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nAn increase in prepayment rates could negatively affect the value of our MBS purchased at a premium, which could result in reduced earnings or losses and negatively affect the cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nOur investment portfolio includes securities backed by pools of residential mortgage loans. For securities backed by pools of residential mortgage loans, we receive income, generally, from the payments that are made by the borrowers under underlying mortgage loans. We may purchase securities that have a higher interest rate than the then-prevailing market interest rate. In exchange for this higher interest rate, we may pay a premium to par value to acquire such securities. Homeowners tend to prepay mortgage loans more quickly when interest rates decline. Prepayments are generally reflected as a reduction of the premium over par value, which means that prepayments may result in recognition of loss of asset value for us. Also, when borrowers prepay their mortgage loans at rates that are faster or slower than expected, it results in amortizations that are faster or slower than anticipated on our assets, which may result in overall lower returns on our investments than originally expected.\nAlthough prepayment rates generally increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise, changes in prepayment rates are difficult to predict. Prepayments can also occur when borrowers sell the property and use the sale proceeds to prepay the mortgage as part of a physical relocation or when borrowers default on their mortgages and the mortgages are prepaid from the proceeds of a foreclosure sale of the property. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will generally, among other conditions, purchase mortgages that are 120 days or more delinquent from holders of such mortgages when the cost of guarantee payments to such holders, including advances of interest at the loan coupon rate, exceeds the cost of holding the nonperforming loans in their portfolios. Consequently, prepayment rates also may be affected by conditions in the housing and financial markets, which may result in increased delinquencies on mortgage loans, the GSEs\u2019 cost of capital, general economic conditions and the relative interest rates on fixed and adjustable rate loans, which could lead to an acceleration of the payment of the related principal. Furthermore, changes in the GSEs\u2019 policies regarding the repurchase of delinquent loans can materially impact prepayment rates. In addition, the introduction of new government programs could increase the availability of mortgage credit to a large number of homeowners in the United States, which could impact the prepayment rates for the entire MBS market, and in particular for agency MBS. Any new programs or changes to existing programs could cause substantial uncertainty around the magnitude of changes in prepayment speeds.\nMoreover, if prepayment rates decrease due to a rising interest rate environment, the average life or duration of our fixed-rate assets will generally be extended. This could have a negative impact on our results from operations, as the maturities of our interest rate hedges are fixed and will, therefore, cover a smaller percentage of our funding exposure on our MBS assets to the extent that the average lives of the mortgages underlying such MBS increase due to slower prepayments.\nAccordingly, faster or slower than expected payments may affect our ability to maintain targeted amounts of leverage and may adversely affect our profitability and cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nMortgage loan modification programs, future legislative action and changes in the requirements necessary to qualify for refinancing a mortgage with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae may adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, the MBS in which we invest.\nOver the last few years, the U.S. government, through the Federal Housing Administration (\u201cFHA\u201d), the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d), has implemented a variety of programs designed to provide homeowners with assistance in avoiding residential mortgage loan foreclosures, which allows certain distressed borrowers to refinance their mortgages into FHA-insured loans. In addition, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac instituted programs designed to assist distressed homeowners avoid foreclosure. These and any future programs may involve, among other things, the modification of mortgage loans to reduce the principal amount of the loans or the rate of interest payable on the loans, or to extend the payment terms of the loans.\nIt is likely that loan modifications would result in increased prepayments on agency MBS. See \u201cRisks to our Business - An increase in prepayment rates could negatively affect the value of our MBS purchased at a premium, which could result in reduced earnings or losses and negatively affect the cash available for distribution to our shareholders\u201d for information relating to the impact of prepayments on our business. These initiatives, any loan modification programs and future legislative or regulatory actions, including amendments to the bankruptcy laws, that result in the modification of outstanding mortgage loans, as well as changes in the requirements necessary to qualify for refinancing a mortgage with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae, may adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, our MBS.\nOur use of repurchase agreements may give our lenders greater rights in the event that either we or any of our lenders file for bankruptcy, which may make it difficult for us to recover our collateral.\nOur borrowings under repurchase agreements may qualify for special treatment under the bankruptcy code, giving our lenders the ability to avoid the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code and take possession of and liquidate our collateral under the repurchase agreements without delay if we file for bankruptcy. Furthermore, the special treatment of repurchase agreements under the bankruptcy code may make it difficult for us to recover our pledged assets in the event that any of our lenders file for bankruptcy. Thus, the use of repurchase agreements exposes our pledged assets to risk in the event of a bankruptcy filing by either our lenders or us. In addition, if the lender is a broker or dealer subject to the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 or an insured depository institution subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, our ability to exercise our rights to recover our investment under a repurchase agreement or to be compensated for any damages resulting from the lender\u2019s insolvency may be further limited by those statutes.\nIf the lending institution under one or more of our repurchase agreements defaults on its obligation to resell the underlying security back to us at the end of the agreement term, we will lose money on our repurchase transactions.\nWhen we engage in a repurchase transaction, we initially sell securities to the transaction counterparty under a master repurchase agreement in exchange for cash from the counterparty. The counterparty is obligated to resell the same securities back to us at the end of the term of the repurchase agreement, which typically is 30 to 90 days, but may have terms from one day to up to three years or more. The cash we receive when we initially sell the collateral is less than the value of the collateral, which is referred to as the \u201chaircut.\u201d If the counterparty in a repurchase transaction defaults on its obligation to resell the securities back to us, we will incur a loss on the transaction equal to the amount of the haircut (assuming no change in the value of the securities). Losses incurred on our repurchase transactions would adversely affect our earnings and our cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nIf we default on our obligations under our repurchase agreements, we may be unable to establish a suitable replacement facility on acceptable terms or at all.\nIf we default on one of our obligations under a repurchase agreement, the counterparty may terminate the agreement and cease entering into any other repurchase agreements with us. In that case, we would likely need to establish a replacement repurchase facility with another financial institution in order to continue to leverage the assets in our investment portfolio and to carry out our investment strategy. We may be unable to establish a suitable replacement repurchase facility on acceptable terms or at all.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt, which could have important consequences to you.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had total unsecured indebtedness (excluding payables, derivative liabilities and recourse liability) of $75.3 million, which includes $25 million in principal amount of our 6.625% Notes, $35.3 million in principal amount of our 6.75% Notes, and $15 million in principal amount of subordinated unsecured long-term debentures due between 2033 and 2035. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to you, because:\n\u2022 it could affect our ability to satisfy our financial obligations;\n\u2022 a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022 it may impair our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future;\n\u2022 it may limit our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity;\n\u2022 it may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u2022 it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.\nOur operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt. If we fail to make payment on the Senior Notes, we could default on the Senior Notes.\nLimitations on our access to capital could impair our liquidity and our ability to conduct our business.\nLiquidity, or ready access to funds, is essential to our business. Failures of similar businesses have often been attributable in large part to insufficient liquidity. Liquidity is of particular importance to our business and perceived liquidity issues may affect our counterparties\u2019 willingness to engage in transactions with us. Our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption, the payment of significant legal defense and indemnification costs, expenses, damages or settlement amounts, or an operational problem that affects us or third parties. Further, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time or the market is experiencing significant volatility. Our inability to maintain adequate liquidity would materially harm our business and operations.\nOur investments may include subordinated tranches of private-label MBS, which are subordinate in right of payment to more senior securities.\nOur investments may include subordinated tranches of private-label MBS, which are subordinated classes of securities in a structure of securities collateralized by a pool of mortgage loans and, accordingly, are the first or among the first classes of securities in such a structure to bear the loss upon a restructuring or liquidation of the underlying collateral and the last to receive payment of interest and principal. Furthermore, our private-label MBS may also consist of subordinate classes of re-securitized senior class MBS. Estimated fair values of these subordinated interests tend to be more sensitive to changes in economic conditions than more senior securities. As a result, such subordinated interests generally are not actively traded and may not provide holders thereof with liquid investments.\nInvestments in non-investment grade private-label MBS may be illiquid, may have a higher risk of default and may not produce current returns.\nWe may invest in private-label MBS that are non-investment grade, which means that major rating agencies rate them below the top four investment-grade rating categories (i.e., \u201cAAA\u201d through \u201cBBB\u201d). Non-investment grade, private-label MBS tend to be less liquid, may have a higher risk of default and may be more difficult to value than investment grade bonds. Recessions or poor economic or pricing conditions in the markets associated with private-label MBS may cause defaults or losses on loans underlying such securities. Non-investment grade securities are considered speculative, and their capacity to pay principal and interest in accordance with the terms of their governing indentures is not certain.\nOur investment portfolio may be concentrated in terms of credit risk.\nAlthough as a general policy we seek to acquire and hold a diverse portfolio of investments, we are not required to observe specific diversification criteria, except as may be set forth in any investment guidelines that may be adopted by our Board of Directors from time to time. Therefore, our investment portfolio may at times be concentrated in certain asset types that are subject to higher risk of foreclosure or secured by properties concentrated in a limited number of geographic locations. To the extent that our portfolio is concentrated in any one region or type of asset, downturns relating generally to such region or type of asset may result in defaults on a number of our assets within a short time period, which may reduce our net asset value, our net income, the value of our securities and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. Our portfolio may contain other concentrations of risk, and we may fail to identify, detect or hedge against those risks, resulting in large or unexpected losses.\nOur due diligence of potential investments may not reveal all of the liabilities associated with those investments and may not reveal aspects of the investments which could lead to investment losses.\nBefore making certain investments, we may undertake due diligence efforts with respect to various aspects of the acquisition, including investigating the strengths and weaknesses of the originator or issuer of the asset and, in the case of acquisitions of private-label MBS, verifying certain aspects of the underlying assets themselves as well as other factors and characteristics that may be material to the performance of the investment. In making the assessment and otherwise conducting due diligence, we rely on resources available to us and, in some cases, third party information. There can be no assurance that any due diligence process that we conduct will uncover relevant facts that could be determinative of whether or not an investment will be successful.\nWe may invest in non-prime mortgage loans or investments collateralized by non-prime mortgage loans, which are subject to increased risks.\nWe may invest in non-prime mortgage loans or investments collateralized by pools of non-prime mortgage loans. In general, non-prime mortgage loans are loans that have been originated using underwriting standards that do not conform to the underwriting guidelines of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Non-prime mortgage loans may allow borrowers to qualify for a mortgage loan with reduced or alternative forms of documentation. They are typically characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher loan-to-value ratios and include a higher percentage of investment properties.\nNon-prime mortgage loans may experience delinquency, foreclosure, bankruptcy and loss rates that are higher, and that may be substantially higher, than those experienced by mortgage loans underwritten in a more traditional manner. Thus, because of the higher delinquency rates and losses associated with non-prime mortgage loans, the performance of non-prime mortgage loans or investments backed by non-prime mortgage loans in which we may invest could be correspondingly adversely affected, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nThe securities and loans we own are likely to lead to variable returns.\nWe actively manage the risks associated with acquiring, holding and disposing of MBS. No amount of risk management or mitigation, however, can change the variable nature of the cash flows, fair values of, and financial results generated by these loans and securities. Changes in the credit performance or the prepayments on the loans underlying private-label MBS and changes in interest rates impact the cash flows on these securities, and the impact could be significant for our securities with concentrated risks. Changes in cash flows lead to changes in our return and also to potential variability in reported income.\nThe revenue recognized on our private-label MBS is based on an estimate of the yield over the remaining life of the asset. Thus, changes in our estimates of expected cash flow from an asset will result in changes in our reported earnings on that asset on a prospective basis. We may be forced to recognize adverse changes in expected future cash flows as a reduction of current income, further adding to earnings volatility.\nOur investments are recorded at fair value based upon assumptions that are inherently subjective, and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of our investments are materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon their disposal.\nWe measure the fair value of our investments quarterly, in accordance with guidance set forth in FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. Ultimate realization of the value of an asset depends to a great extent on economic and other conditions that are beyond our control. Further, fair value is only an estimate based on good faith judgment of the price at which an investment can be sold because market prices of investments can only be determined by negotiation between a willing buyer and seller. If we were to liquidate a particular asset, the realized value may be more than or less than the amount at which such asset is valued. Accordingly, the value of our Class A common stock and Senior Notes could be adversely affected by our determinations regarding the fair value of our investments, whether in the applicable period or in the future. Additionally, such valuations may fluctuate over short periods of time.\nOur determination of the fair value of our agency MBS is based on price estimates provided by third-party pricing services. In general, pricing services heavily disclaim their valuations. Depending on the complexity and illiquidity of a security, valuations of the same security can vary substantially from one pricing service to another. Our private-label MBS trade infrequently and may be considered illiquid. Our determination of the fair value of our private-label MBS is based on significant unobservable inputs based on various assumptions made by management of the Company. These significant unobservable inputs may include assumptions regarding future interest rates, prepayment rates, discount rates, credit loss rates, and the timing of credit losses. These assumptions are inherently subjective and involve a high degree of management judgment, and our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a public market for these securities existed. Therefore, our results of operations for a given period could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair market value of these investments are materially different than the values that we ultimately realize upon their disposal.\nBeginning in fiscal year 2016, the Company intends to change its accounting policy for recognizing interest income on investments in agency MBS classified as trading securities. This change may have a material effect on the Company\u2019s historical and future reported periodic net interest income.\nBeginning in fiscal year 2016, the Company intends to change its accounting policy for recognizing interest income on its investments in agency MBS classified as trading securities by amortizing purchase premiums (or accreting purchase discounts) as an adjustment to interest income in accordance with the \u201cinterest method\u201d permitted by GAAP. The change in accounting policy will be retrospectively applied to all historical periods. Because the Company accounts for investments in trading agency MBS on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value with all periodic changes in fair value reflected in the Company\u2019s net income, this change in accounting policy will not have an effect on the Company\u2019s historical or future consolidated balance sheets nor will it have an effect on the Company\u2019s historical or future reported net income or comprehensive income. The change in accounting policy will, however, result in a reclassification between reported \u201cinvestment gains (losses), net\u201d and interest income on the Company\u2019s historical and future periodic consolidated statements of comprehensive income. As the Company\u2019s agency MBS have generally been acquired at a premium to par value, historical and future reported periodic interest income will be reduced by periodic premium amortization, while periodic investment gains (losses) reported as a component of \u201cinvestment gain (loss), net\u201d will be increased (decreased) by an equal and offsetting amount. While this change in financial reporting is not indicative of a change in the underlying economics of the Company\u2019s business or results of operations, a reduction in the Company\u2019s reported periodic net interest income may, nonetheless, adversely affect market participants\u2019 perception of our results of operations and, in turn, adversely affect the market value of our Class A common stock and Senior Notes.\nCredit ratings assigned to investment debt securities by the credit rating agencies may not accurately reflect the risks associated with those securities.\nWe make certain investment decisions after factoring in a series of data, including credit ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. However, a credit rating may not accurately reflect the risks associated with a particular debt security, such as private-label MBS. Rating agencies rate certain debt securities based upon their assessment of the safety of the receipt of principal and interest payments. Rating agencies do not consider the risks of fluctuations in fair value or other factors that may influence the value of debt securities and, therefore, the assigned credit rating may not fully reflect the true risks of an investment. Also, rating agencies may fail to make timely adjustments to credit ratings based on available data or changes in economic outlook or may otherwise fail to make changes in credit ratings in response to subsequent events, such that our investments may be of higher or lower credit risk than the ratings indicate. A downgrade in credit rating can materially adversely affect the fair value of a rated security. Our assessment of the quality of a potential investment that relies, in part, on that security\u2019s credit rating may prove to be inaccurate, and we may incur credit losses in excess of our initial expectations.\nFurthermore, credit rating agencies may change their methods of evaluating credit risk and determining ratings on MBS. These changes may occur quickly and often. The market\u2019s ability to understand and absorb these changes, and the impact to the securitization market in general, are difficult to predict. Such changes will have an impact on the amount of investment-grade and non-investment-grade securities that are created or placed on the market in the future. A change in the amount of investment-grade and non-investment-grade securities that are created or placed in the market could materially adversely impact the value of the MBS in our portfolio and potentially limit or increase the value of MBS available for purchase in the future.\nCredit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold the Senior Notes or our other senior unsecured debt that we may issue from time to time, and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time.\nOne or more independent credit rating agencies may assign and maintain credit ratings to our Senior Notes and other indebtedness that we may offer from time to time. The credit ratings reflect rating agencies\u2019 assessment of our ability to perform our obligations under the Senior Notes, including an assessment of credit risks in determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under such debt. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, risk and other factors relating to, and that may affect the value of, such securities. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. Ratings do not reflect market prices or suitability of a security for a particular investor. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Senior Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Senior Notes, as well as other of our senior unsecured debt that we may issue from time to time.\nWe may change our investment strategy, hedging strategy, asset allocation and operational policies without shareholder consent, which may result in riskier investments and adversely affect the market value of our Class A common stock and Senior Notes and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.\nWe may change our investment strategy, hedging strategy, asset allocation and operational policies at any time without the consent of our shareholders, which could result in our making investment or hedge decisions that are different from, and possibly riskier than, the investments and hedges described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A change in our investment or hedging strategy may increase our exposure to interest rate and real estate market fluctuations. A change in our asset allocation could result in us making investments in securities, assets or business different from those described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our Board of Directors oversees our operational policies, including those with respect to our acquisitions, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and distributions or approves transactions that deviate from these policies without a vote of, or notice to, our shareholders. Operational policy changes could adversely affect the market value of our Class A common stock or Senior Notes and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. Investing in assets other than MBS or pursuing business activities other than investing in MBS may not be successful and could adversely affect our results of operations and the market value of our Class A common stock or Senior Notes.\nOur Board of Directors does not approve each of our investment decisions.\nOur Board of Directors oversees our operational policies and periodically reviews our investment guidelines and our investment portfolio. However, our Board of Directors does not review all of our proposed investments. In addition, in conducting periodic reviews, our Board of Directors may rely primarily on information provided to them by our management. Furthermore, transactions entered into or structured for us by our management may be difficult or impossible to unwind by the time they are reviewed by our directors.\nWe operate in a highly-competitive market for investment opportunities, which could make it difficult for us to purchase or originate investments at attractive yields and thus have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe gain access to investment opportunities only to the extent that they become known to us. Gaining access to investment opportunities is highly competitive. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than us and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources, more long-standing relationships, broader product offerings and other advantages. Some of our competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. The Federal Reserve\u2019s continuing reinvestment of principal and interest payments on the MBS held in its portfolio may result in increased competition for attractive opportunities in our target investments. As a result of this competition, we may not be able to purchase or originate our target investments at attractive yields, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Business and Structure\nOur Rights Plan could inhibit a change in our control.\nWe have a Rights Plan designed to protect against a possible limitation on our ability to use our NOLs, NCLs and built-in losses by dissuading investors from aggregating ownership of our Class A common stock and triggering an \u201cownership change\u201d for purposes of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Under the terms of the Rights Plan, in general, if a person or group acquires or commences a tender or exchange offer for beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock upon a determination by our Board of Directors (an \u201cAcquiring Person\u201d), all of our other Class A and Class B common shareholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a discount to such securities\u2019 fair market value, thus causing substantial dilution to the Acquiring Person. The Rights Plan may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control not approved by our Board of Directors and, notwithstanding its purpose, could adversely affect our shareholders\u2019 ability to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for our common stock in connection with such a transaction. In addition, because our Board of Directors can prevent the Rights Plan from operating, in the event our Board of Directors approves of an Acquiring Person, the Rights Plan gives our Board of Directors significant discretion over whether a potential acquirer\u2019s efforts to acquire a large interest in us will be successful. Consequently, the Rights Plan could impede transactions that would otherwise benefit our shareholders.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock or Senior Notes may be adversely affected by factors outside of our control.\nAny negative changes in the public\u2019s perception of the prospects for our business or the types of assets in which we invest could depress our stock price regardless of our results. The following factors, among others, could contribute to the volatility of the price of our Class A common stock or Senior Notes:\n\u2022 actual or unanticipated variations in our quarterly results;\n\u2022 changes in our financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022 conditions or trends affecting companies that make investments similar to ours;\n\u2022 changes in interest rate environments and the mortgage market that cause our borrowing costs to increase, our reported yields on our MBS portfolio to decrease or that cause the value of our MBS portfolio to decrease;\n\u2022 changes in the market valuations of the securities in our MBS portfolio and other principal investments;\n\u2022 negative changes in the public\u2019s perception of the prospects of investment or financial services companies;\n\u2022 changes in the regulatory environment in which our business operates;\n\u2022 dilution resulting from new equity issuances;\n\u2022 general economic conditions such as a recession, or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations; and\n\u2022 additions or departures of our key personnel.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control.\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results.\nOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to a combination of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the market value of the MBS we acquire, the performance of our hedging instruments, prepayment rates and changes in interest rates. As a result, we may fail to meet profitability or dividend expectations, which could negatively affect the market price of our Class A common stock and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe cannot assure you that we will pay dividends in the future.\nPursuant to our variable dividend policy, our Board of Directors evaluates dividends on a quarterly basis and, in its sole discretion, approves the payment of dividends. Our dividend policy differs from many of our competitors who qualify as REITs that must distribute to their shareholders at least 90% of their REIT taxable income each taxable year. There can be no assurances that our Board of Directors will continue to approve the payment of future dividends at the current levels, if any at all.\nLitigation involving our company could result in significant legal expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs described under \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we may in the future become subject to litigation. Such litigation may result in significant defense costs and potentially significant judgments against us, some of which are not, or cannot be, insured against. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any litigation, and cannot estimate the likelihood or potential dollar amount of any adverse results. We may be unable to accurately estimate our exposure to litigation risk when we record balance sheet reserves for probable loss contingencies. As a result, any reserves we establish to cover any settlements or judgments, if any, may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure, which may have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In the event of an adverse judgment in any action or proceeding, we may be required to pay damages or penalties, or other remedies may be imposed upon us, which could have a material adverse impact upon our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and could also cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our business and prospects.\nIndemnification obligations to certain of our current and former directors and officers may increase the costs to us of legal proceedings involving our company.\nOur charter contains a provision that limits the liability of our directors and officers to us and our shareholders for money damages, except for liability resulting from willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the criminal law or any federal or state securities law. Our charter also requires us to indemnify our directors and officers in connection with any liability incurred by them in connection with any action or proceeding (including any action by us or in our right) to which they are or may be made a party by reason of their service in those or other capacities if the conduct in question was in our best interests and the person was acting on our behalf or performing services for us, unless the person engaged in willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the criminal law. The Virginia Stock Corporation Act requires a Virginia corporation (unless its charter provides otherwise, which our charter does not) to indemnify a director or officer who has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he is made a party by reason of his service in that capacity.\nIn addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with certain of our current and former directors and officers under which we are generally required to indemnify them against liability incurred by them in connection with any action or proceeding to which they are or may be made a party by reason of their service in those or other capacities, if the conduct in question was in our best interests and the person was conducting themselves in good faith (subject to certain exceptions, including liabilities arising from willful misconduct, a knowing violation of the criminal law or receipt of an improper benefit).\nIn the future we may be the subject of indemnification assertions under our charter, Virginia law or these indemnification agreements by our current and former directors and officers who are or may become party to any action or proceeding. We maintain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policies that may limit our exposure and enable us to recover a portion of any amounts paid with respect to such obligations. However, if our coverage under these policies is reduced, denied, eliminated or otherwise not available to us, our potential financial exposure would be increased. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations could be significant. Amounts paid pursuant to our indemnification obligations could adversely affect our financial results and the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nLoss of our exclusion from regulation as an investment company under the 1940 Act would adversely affect us and may reduce the market price of our shares.\nWe rely on Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act for our exclusion from the registration requirements of the 1940 Act. This provision requires that 55% of our assets, on an unconsolidated basis, consist of qualifying assets, such as agency whole pool certificates, and 80% of our assets, on an unconsolidated basis, consist of qualifying assets or real estate-related assets. We will need to ensure not only that we qualify for an exclusion or exemption from regulation under the 1940 Act, but also that each of our subsidiaries qualifies for such an exclusion or exemption. We intend to maintain our exclusion by monitoring the value of our interests in our subsidiaries. We may not be successful in this regard.\nIf we fail to maintain our exclusion and another exclusion or exemption is not available, we may be required to register as an investment company, or we may be required to acquire or dispose of assets in order to meet our exemption. Any such asset acquisitions or dispositions may include assets that we would not acquire or dispose of in the ordinary course of business, may be at unfavorable prices and result in a decline in the price of our Class A common stock or Senior Notes. If we are required to register under the 1940 Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure (including our ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the 1940 Act), and portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration and other matters. Accordingly, registration under the 1940 Act could limit our ability to follow our current investment and financing strategies and result in a decline in the price of our Class A common stock or Senior Notes.\nFailure to obtain and maintain an exemption from being regulated as a commodity pool operator could subject us to additional regulation and compliance requirements and may result in fines and other penalties which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive new regulatory framework for derivative contracts commonly referred to as \u201cswaps.\u201d As a result, any investment fund that trades in swaps or other derivatives may be considered a \u201ccommodity pool,\u201d which would cause its operators (in some cases the fund\u2019s directors) to be regulated as \u201ccommodity pool operators,\u201d or CPOs. Under rules adopted by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) for which the compliance date generally was December 31, 2012 as to those funds that become commodity pools solely because of their use of swaps, CPOs must by then have filed an application for registration with the National Futures Association (\u201cNFA\u201d) and have commenced and sustained good faith efforts to comply with the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC\u2019s regulations with respect to capital raising, disclosure, reporting, recordkeeping and other business conduct applicable for their activities as CPOs as if the CPOs were in fact registered in such capacity (which also requires compliance with applicable NFA rules). However, the CFTC\u2019s Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight issued a no-action letter saying, although it believes that mortgage REITs are properly considered commodity pools, it would not recommend that the CFTC take enforcement action against the operator of a mortgage REIT who does not register as a CPO if, among other things, the mortgage REIT limits the initial margin and premiums required to establish its swaps, futures and other commodity interest positions to not more than five percent (5%) of its total assets, the mortgage REIT limits the net income derived annually from those commodity interest positions which are not qualifying hedging transactions to less than five percent (5%) of its gross income, and interests in the mortgage REIT are not marketed to the public as or in a commodity pool or otherwise as or in a vehicle for trading in the commodity futures, commodity options or swaps markets.\nWe use hedging instruments in conjunction with our investment portfolio and related borrowings to reduce or mitigate risks associated with changes in interest rates, yield curve shapes and market volatility. These hedging instruments include interest rate swaps, interest rate swap futures, Eurodollar futures, options, and U.S. Treasury note futures. We do not currently engage in any speculative derivatives activities or other non-hedging transactions using swaps, futures or options on futures. We do not use these instruments for the purpose of trading in commodity interests, and we do not consider our company or its operations to be a commodity pool as to which CPO registration or compliance is required. We have claimed the relief afforded by the above-described no-action letter. Consequently, we will be restricted to operating within the parameters discussed in the no-action letter and will not enter into hedging transactions covered by the no-action letter if they would cause us to exceed the limits set forth in the no-action letter. However, there can be no assurance that the CFTC will agree that we are entitled to the no-action letter relief claimed.\nThe CFTC has substantial enforcement power with respect to violations of the laws over which it has jurisdiction, including their anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions. For example, the CFTC may suspend or revoke the registration of or the no-action relief afforded to a person who fails to comply with commodities laws and regulations, prohibit such a person from trading or doing business with registered entities, impose civil money penalties, require restitution and seek fines or imprisonment for criminal violations. In the event that the CFTC staff does not provide the no action letter relief we requested or asserts that we are not entitled to the mortgage REIT no-action letter relief claimed or if CFTC otherwise determines that CPO registration and compliance is required of us, we may be obligated to furnish additional disclosures and reports, among other things. Further, a private right of action exists against those who violate the laws over which the CFTC has jurisdiction or who willfully aid, abet, counsel, induce or procure a violation of those laws. In the event that we fail to comply with statutory requirements relating to derivatives or with the CFTC\u2019s rules thereunder, including the mortgage REIT no-action letter described above, we may be subject to significant fines, penalties and other civil or governmental actions or proceedings, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face competition for personnel, which could adversely affect our business and in turn negatively affect the market price of our Class A common stock or Senior Notes and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe are dependent on the highly-skilled, and often highly-specialized, individuals we employ. Retention of specialists to manage our portfolio is particularly important to our prospects. Competition for the recruiting and retention of employees may increase elements of our compensation costs. We may not be able to recruit and hire new employees with our desired qualifications in a timely manner. Our incentives may be insufficient to recruit and retain our employees. Increased compensation costs could adversely affect the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders and our failure to recruit and retain qualified employees could materially and adversely affect our future operating results.\nWe are dependent upon a small number of key senior professionals and the loss of any of these individuals could adversely affect our financial results which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our Class A common stock and Senior Notes and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe currently do not have employment agreements with any of our senior officers and other key professionals. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to have access to members of our senior management team or other key professionals. The loss of any members of our senior management and other key professionals could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are highly dependent upon communications and information systems operated by third parties, and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our Class A common stock and Senior Notes and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nOur business is highly dependent upon communications and information systems that allow us to monitor, value, buy, sell, finance and hedge our investments. These systems are primarily operated by third parties and, as a result, we have limited ability to ensure their continued operation. Furthermore, in the event of systems failure or interruption, we will have limited ability to affect the timing and success of systems restoration. Any failure or interruption of our systems or third-party trading or information systems could cause delays or other problems in our securities trading activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the market price of our Class A common stock and Senior Notes and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nIf we issue additional debt securities or other equity securities that rank senior to our common stock, our operations may be restricted and we will be exposed to additional risk and the market price of our Class A common stock and Senior Notes could be adversely affected.\nIf we decide to issue additional debt securities in the future, it is likely that such securities will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable or other securities registered pursuant to our shelf registration statement that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our Class A common stock. Also shares of preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments that could limit our ability to make a dividend distribution to the holders of our Class A common stock. We, and indirectly our shareholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Holders of debt securities may be granted specific rights, including but not limited to, the right to hold a perfected security interest in certain of our assets, the right to accelerate payments due under the indenture, rights to restrict dividend payments, and rights to approve the sale of assets. Such additional restrictive covenants, operating restrictions and preferential dividends could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the market price of our Class A common stock and our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders.\nTax Risks of our Business and Structure\nWe may not be able generate future taxable income to fully utilize our tax benefits.\nWe recognize the expected future tax benefit from a deferred tax asset when the tax benefit is considered more likely than not to be realized. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against the deferred tax asset. Assuming the recoverability of a deferred tax asset requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flow from operations, the character of expected income or loss as either ordinary or capital and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and the amount or character of taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize the deferred tax asset could be impacted. To the extent our estimates of our ability to realize our tax benefits change, we would be required to record changes to our valuation allowance applied against our deferred tax asset. In addition, our NOL carry-forwards begin to expire in 2027 and our NCL carry-forwards begin to expire in 2019. We may not generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate tax character to fully utilize these carry-forwards prior to their expiration. To the extent that our NOL or NCL carry-forwards expire unutilized, we would be required to write off the corresponding deferred tax asset. If we were to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax asset or if we were to write off expired loss carry-forwards, our net income and net book value would be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to use our tax benefits could be substantially limited if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d\nOur NOL and NCL carry-forwards and certain recognized built-in losses may be limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if 5% shareholders increase their collective ownership of the aggregate amount of the outstanding shares of our company by more than 50 percentage points looking back over the relevant testing period. If an ownership change occurs, our ability to use our NOLs, NCLs and certain recognized built-in losses to reduce our taxable income in a future year would be limited to a Section 382 limitation equal to the fair market value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt interest rate in effect for the month of the ownership change. The long-term tax-exempt rate for January 2016 is 2.65%. In the event of an ownership change, NOLs and NCLs that exceed the Section 382 limitation in any year will continue to be allowed as carry-forwards for the remainder of the carry-forward period and such losses can be used to offset taxable income for years within the carry-forward period subject to the Section 382 limitation in each year. However, if the carry-forward period for any NOL or NCL were to expire before that loss had been fully utilized, the unused portion of that loss would be lost. Our use of new NOLs or NCLs arising after the date of an ownership change would not be affected by the Section 382 limitation (unless there were another ownership change after those new losses arose).\nWe have a Rights Plan designed to protect against the occurrence of an ownership change. The Rights Plan is intended to act as a deterrent to any person or group acquiring 4.9% or more of our outstanding Class A common stock without the approval of our Board of Directors. See \u201cRisks Related to our Business and Structure - Our Rights Plan could inhibit a change in our control\u201d for information on our Rights Plan. The Rights Plan, however, does not protect against all transactions that could cause an ownership change, such as public issuances and repurchases of shares of Class A common stock. The Rights Plan may not be successful in preventing an ownership change within the meaning of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, and we may lose all or most of the anticipated tax benefits associated with our prior losses.\nBased on our knowledge of our stock ownership, we do not believe that an ownership change has occurred since our losses were generated. Accordingly, we believe that at the current time there is no annual limitation imposed on our use of our NOLs and NCLs to reduce future taxable income. The determination of whether an ownership change has occurred or will occur is complicated and depends on changes in percentage stock ownership among shareholders. Other than the Rights Plan, there are currently no restrictions on the transfer of our stock that would discourage or prevent transactions that could cause an ownership change, although we may adopt such restrictions in the future. As discussed above, the Rights Plan is intended to discourage transactions that could cause an ownership change. In addition, we have not obtained, and currently do not plan to obtain, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, regarding our conclusion as to whether our losses are subject to any such limitations. Furthermore, we may decide in the future that it is necessary or in our interest to take certain actions that could result in an ownership change. Therefore, no assurance can be provided as to whether an ownership change has occurred or will occur in the future.\nPreserving the ability to use our NOLs and NCLs may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities.\nLimitations imposed by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code may discourage us from, among other things, repurchasing our stock or issuing additional stock to raise capital or to acquire businesses or assets. Accordingly, our desire to preserve our NOLs and NCLs may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities.\nIf we elect in the future to be treated as a REIT, complying with the REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities, may result in higher income tax rates on dividends you may receive, and could result in a reduction in our net book value.\nWe revoked our status as a REIT effective January 1, 2009, in part to maximize the use of tax benefits associated with our NOLs and NCLs. In the future, we might make an election again to be taxed as a REIT for various business reasons, including if we no longer have the benefit of NOL carry-forwards. To qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we would be required to continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our shareholders and the ownership of our stock. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to forego attractive business or investment opportunities. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits. In addition, in order to qualify as a REIT, an entity must distribute to its shareholders, each calendar year, at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. As a result, if we elect to be treated as a REIT, we generally will be required to distribute our earnings to our shareholders rather than retaining our earnings for reinvestment in our business.\nCurrently as a C-corporation, distributions to our shareholders of current or accumulated earnings and profits are qualified dividends eligible for the 23.8% federal income tax rate whereas similar distributions to shareholders of a REIT of current or accumulated earnings and profits are nonqualified dividends subject to the higher 43.4% federal income tax rate on ordinary income (both percentages inclusive of the 3.8% Medicare tax). If we were to elect to be treated as a REIT, future dividends you receive could be subjected to a higher tax rate. If our dividends are subject to a higher tax rate, the market value of our common stock could also be adversely affected.\nIf we were to elect in the future to be treated as a REIT, any remaining net deferred tax asset would likely need to be written off for GAAP accounting purposes. As a result, our net income and net book value could be adversely affected upon our election to be taxed as a REIT.\nThe decision to elect REIT status is in the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that we will, or will not, elect such status for 2016 or in the future.", "PERMNO": 85653, "SIC": 6799, "TIC": "AI"}
