{"cik": "1289460", "company": "Texas Roadhouse, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nFrom time to time, in periodic reports and oral statements and in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we present statements about future events and expectations that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future financial and operating performance and growth plans, taking into account the information currently available to us. These statements are not statements of historical fact. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations of future results we express or imply in any forward-looking statements.\nCareful consideration should be given to the risks described below. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Growth and Operating Strategy\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, it could harm our business.\nFailure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business. We have grown significantly since our inception and intend to continue growing in the future. Our objective is to grow our business and increase stockholder value by (1) expanding our base of company restaurants (and, to a lesser extent, franchise restaurants) that are profitable and (2) increasing sales and profits at existing restaurants. While both these methods of achieving our objective are important to us, historically the most significant means of achieving our objective has been through opening new restaurants and operating these restaurants on a profitable basis. As we open and operate more restaurants, our rate of expansion relative to the size of our existing restaurant base will decline, which may make it increasingly difficult to achieve levels of sales and profitability growth that we have seen in the past. In addition, our existing restaurant management systems, financial and management controls and information systems may not be adequate to support our planned expansion. Our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems, procedures and controls and to locate, hire, train and retain management and operating personnel. We also place a lot of importance on our culture, which we believe has been an important contributor to our success. As we grow, we may have difficulty maintaining our culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to respond on a timely basis to all of the changing demands that our planned expansion will impose on management and on our existing infrastructure. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business and operating results could be materially adversely impacted.\nOur growth strategy, which primarily depends on our ability to open new restaurants that are profitable, is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to open new restaurants in accordance with our expansion plans. We have experienced delays in opening some of our restaurants in the past and may experience delays in the future. Delays or failures in opening new restaurants could materially adversely affect our growth strategy. One of our biggest challenges in executing our growth strategy is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new restaurant sites. Competition for suitable restaurant sites in our target markets is intense. Our ability to open new restaurants will also depend on numerous other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nour ability to find sufficient suitable locations for new restaurant sites;\n\u00b7\nour ability to hire, train and retain qualified operating personnel, especially market partners and managing partners;\n\u00b7\nour ability to negotiate suitable purchase or lease terms;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of construction materials and labor;\n\u00b7\nour ability to control construction and development costs of new restaurants;\n\u00b7\nour ability to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u00b7\nthe delay or cancellation of new site development by developers and landlords;\n\u00b7\nour ability to secure liquor licenses;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nthe cost and availability of capital to fund construction costs and pre-opening expenses; and\n\u00b7\nthe impact of inclement weather, natural disasters and other calamities.\nOnce opened, we anticipate that our new restaurants will generally take several months to reach planned operating levels due to start-up inefficiencies typically associated with new restaurants. We cannot assure you that any restaurant we open will be profitable or obtain operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants. Some of our new restaurants will be located in areas where we have little or no meaningful experience. Restaurants opened in new markets may open at lower average weekly sales volume than restaurants opened in existing markets and may have higher restaurant-level operating expense ratios than in existing markets. Sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to reach average unit volume, if at all, thereby affecting our overall profitability. Our ability to operate new restaurants profitably will depend on numerous factors, including those discussed below impacting our average unit volume and comparable restaurant sales growth, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\ncompetition, either from our competitors in the restaurant industry or our own restaurants;\n\u00b7\nconsumer acceptance of our restaurants in new domestic or international markets;\n\u00b7\nchanges in consumer tastes and/or discretionary spending patterns;\n\u00b7\nlack of market awareness of our brands;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of the market partner and the managing partner to execute our business strategy at the new restaurant;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions which can affect restaurant traffic, local labor costs, and prices we pay for the food products and other supplies we use;\n\u00b7\nchanges in government regulation;\n\u00b7\nroad construction and other factors limiting access to the restaurant; and\n\u00b7\nthe impact of inclement weather, natural disasters and other calamities.\nOur failure to successfully open new restaurants that are profitable in accordance with our growth strategy could harm our business and future prospects. In addition, our inability to open new restaurants and provide growth opportunities for our employees could result in the loss of qualified personnel which could harm our business and future prospects.\nYou should not rely on past changes in our average unit volume or our comparable restaurant sales growth as an indication of our future results of operations because they may fluctuate significantly.\nA number of factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our average unit volume and comparable restaurant sales growth, including, among other factors:\n\u00b7\nconsumer awareness and understanding of our brands;\n\u00b7\nour ability to execute our business strategy effectively;\n\u00b7\nunusual initial sales performance by new restaurants;\n\u00b7\ncompetition, either from our competitors in the restaurant industry or our own restaurants;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of inclement weather, natural disasters and other calamities;\n\u00b7\nconsumer trends and seasonality;\n\u00b7\nour ability to increase menu prices without adversely impacting guest traffic counts or per person average check growth;\n\u00b7\nintroduction of new menu items;\n\u00b7\nnegative publicity regarding food safety, health concerns, quality of service, and other food or beverage related matters, including the integrity of our or our suppliers\u2019 food processing;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions, which can affect restaurant traffic, local labor costs and prices we pay for the food products and other supplies we use; and\n\u00b7\neffects of actual or threatened terrorist attacks.\nOur average unit volume and comparable restaurant sales growth may not increase at rates achieved in the past, which may affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting our profitability. In addition, changes in our average unit volume and comparable restaurant sales growth could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nThe development of new restaurant concepts may not contribute to our growth.\nThe development of new restaurant concepts may not be as successful as our experience in the development of the Texas Roadhouse concept. In May 2013, we launched a new concept, Bubba\u2019s 33, a family-friendly, sports restaurant, which currently has lower brand awareness and less operating experience than most Texas Roadhouse restaurants and a higher initial investment cost. As a result, the development of the Bubba\u2019s 33 concept may not contribute to our average unit volume growth and/or profitability in a meaningful way. As of December 25, 2018, we have expanded the concept to 25 restaurants and expect to open as many as four additional locations in 2019. However, we can provide no assurance that new units will be accepted in the markets targeted for the expansion of this concept or that we will be able to achieve our targeted returns when opening new locations. In the future, we may determine not to move forward with any further expansion of Bubba\u2019s 33 or other concepts. These decisions could limit our overall long-term growth. Additionally, expansion of Bubba\u2019s 33 or other concepts might divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and could have an adverse impact on our core Texas Roadhouse business.\nOur expansion into international markets may present increased economic, political, regulatory and other risks.\nAs of December 25, 2018, our operations include 22 Texas Roadhouse franchise restaurants in nine countries outside the United States, and we expect to have further international expansion in the future. The entrance into international markets may not be as successful as our experience in the development of the Texas Roadhouse concept domestically or any success we have had in international restaurants. In addition, operating in international markets may require significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic, and political risks that are different from and incremental to those in the United States. In addition to the risks that we face in the United States, our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\u00b7\nthe need to adapt our brand for specific cultural and language differences;\n\u00b7\nnew and different sources of competition;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to identify appropriate business partners;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in adapting and sourcing product specifications for international restaurant locations;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in complying with local laws, regulations, and customs in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\npolitical or social unrest, economic instability and destabilization of a region;\n\u00b7\neffects of actual or threatened terrorist attacks;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar laws in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\ndifferences in enforceability and registration of intellectual property and contract rights;\n\u00b7\nadverse tax consequences;\n\u00b7\nprofit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds; and\n\u00b7\ndifferent and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws.\nOur failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our future international operations and our overall business and results of our operations.\nWe are also subject to governmental regulations throughout the world impacting the way we do business with our international franchisees. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs, tariffs and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could adversely impact our business and financial performance.\nAcquisition of existing restaurants from our domestic franchisees and other strategic initiatives may have unanticipated consequences that could harm our business and our financial condition.\nWe plan to opportunistically acquire existing restaurants from our domestic franchisees over time. Additionally, from time to time, we evaluate potential mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives to acquire or develop additional concepts. To successfully execute any acquisition or development strategy, we will need to identify\nsuitable acquisition or development candidates, negotiate acceptable acquisition or development terms and obtain appropriate financing.\nAny acquisition or future development that we pursue, including the on-going development of new concepts, whether or not successfully completed, may involve risks, including:\n\u00b7\nmaterial adverse effects on our operating results, particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the acquisition or development as the restaurants are integrated into our operations;\n\u00b7\nrisks associated with entering into new domestic or international markets or conducting operations where we have no or limited prior experience;\n\u00b7\nrisks inherent in accurately assessing the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates, and our ability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies; and\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns.\nFuture acquisitions of existing restaurants from our franchisees or other strategic partners, which may be accomplished through a cash purchase transaction, the issuance of shares of common stock or a combination of both, could have a dilutive impact on holders of our common stock, and result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and impairment charges related to goodwill and other tangible and intangible assets, any of which could harm our business and financial condition.\nApproximately 14% of our company restaurants are located in Texas and, as a result, we are sensitive to economic and other trends and developments in that state.\nAs of December 25, 2018, we operated a total of 67 company restaurants in Texas. As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse trends and economic conditions in this state, including its labor market. In addition, given our geographic concentration in this state, negative publicity regarding any of our restaurants in Texas could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations, as could other occurrences in Texas such as local strikes, energy shortages or extreme fluctuations in energy prices, droughts, earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters.\nChanges in consumer preferences and discretionary spending could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the popularity of our food products. Continued social concerns or shifts in consumer preferences away from our restaurants or cuisine, particularly beef, would harm our business. Also, our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. Accordingly, we may experience declines in sales during economic downturns or during periods of uncertainty. Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of several factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses;\n\u00b7\nrestaurant operating costs for our newly-opened restaurants, which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation than thereafter;\n\u00b7\nlabor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel including mandated changes in federal and/or state minimum and tipped wage rates, overtime regulations, state unemployment taxes, or health benefits;\n\u00b7\nprofitability of our restaurants, particularly in new markets;\n\u00b7\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of litigation, including negative publicity;\n\u00b7\nincreases and decreases in average unit volume and comparable restaurant sales growth;\n\u00b7\nimpairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill, and any loss on restaurant relocations or closures;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions which can affect restaurant traffic, local labor costs, and prices we pay for the food products and other supplies we use;\n\u00b7\nnegative publicity regarding food safety, health concerns and other food and beverage related matters, including the integrity of our or our suppliers\u2019 food processing;\n\u00b7\nnegative publicity relating to the consumption of beef or other products we serve;\n\u00b7\nchanges in consumer preferences and competitive conditions;\n\u00b7\nexpansion to new domestic and/or international markets;\n\u00b7\nadverse weather conditions which impact guest traffic at our restaurants;\n\u00b7\nincreases in infrastructure costs;\n\u00b7\nadoption of new, or changes in existing, accounting policies or practices;\n\u00b7\nchanges in and/or interpretations of federal and state tax laws;\n\u00b7\nactual self-insurance claims varying from actuarial estimates;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in commodity prices;\n\u00b7\ncompetitive actions; and\n\u00b7\nthe impact of inclement weather, natural disasters and other calamities.\nOur business is also subject to minor seasonal fluctuations. Historically, sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the winter months of each year. Holidays, changes in weather, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. As a result, our quarterly operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate as a result of seasonality. Accordingly, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease. In the future, operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the price of our common stock could decrease.\nRisks Related to the Restaurant Industry\nChanges in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs. Any increase in food prices, particularly proteins, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control, such as food supply constrictions, weather conditions, food safety concerns, product recalls, global market and trade conditions, and government regulations. We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results. Extreme and/or long term increases in commodity prices could adversely affect our future results, especially if we are unable, primarily due to competitive reasons, to increase menu prices. Additionally, if there is a time lag between the increasing commodity prices and our ability to increase menu prices or if we believe the commodity price increase to be short in duration and we choose not to pass on the cost increases, our short-term results could be negatively affected. Also, if we adjust pricing there is no assurance that we will realize the full benefit of any adjustment due to changes in our guests\u2019 menu item selections and guest traffic.\nWe currently purchase the majority of our beef from three beef suppliers under annual contracts. While we maintain relationships with additional suppliers, if any of these vendors were unable to fulfill its obligations under its contracts, we could encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies, either of which would harm our business.\nOur business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or labor shortages.\nLabor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business. We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our restaurant managers and hourly employees. Increased labor costs due to competition, unionization, increased minimum and tipped wages, changes in overtime pay, state unemployment rates or employee benefits costs, or otherwise would adversely impact our operating expenses.\nIncreased competition for qualified employees caused by a shortage in the labor pool exerts upward pressure on wages paid to attract and retain such personnel, resulting in higher labor costs, together with greater recruitment and training expense. We could suffer from significant indirect costs, including restaurant disruptions due to management or hourly labor turnover and potential delays in new restaurant openings. A shortage in the labor pool could also cause our restaurants to be required to operate with reduced staff which could negatively impact our ability to provide adequate service levels to our guests resulting in adverse guest reactions and a possible reduction in guest traffic counts.\nWe have many restaurants located in states or municipalities where the minimum and/or tipped wage is greater than the federal minimum and/or tipped wage. We anticipate that additional legislation increasing minimum and/or tipped wage standards will be enacted in future periods and in other jurisdictions. In 2016, the Department of Labor published changes related to the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") which resulted in changes to the threshold for overtime pay. The changes were scheduled to go into effect on December 1, 2016, however, in late November 2016, a federal judge blocked the implementation. Despite the injunction, we implemented the changes to our overtime policy as originally defined by the Department of Labor. We implemented the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (\"PPACA\") as it relates to health care reform and related rules and regulations and continue to monitor the impact of this law on our business. Further regulatory action may occur as a result of the current political environment which could result in changes to healthcare eligibility, design and cost structure. Any increases in minimum or tipped wages or increases in employee benefits costs will result in higher labor costs.\nOur operating margin will be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable or are unwilling to offset any increase in these labor costs through higher prices on our products. Our distributors and suppliers also may be affected by higher minimum wage and benefit standards which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us. Our success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees to keep pace with our growth strategy. If we are unable to do so, our results of operations may also be adversely affected.\nOur objective to increase sales and profits at existing restaurants could be adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions.\nDuring 2019 and beyond, the U.S. and global economies could suffer from a downturn in economic activity. Recessionary economic cycles, higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, inflation, increases in commodity prices, higher levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws or other economic factors that may affect consumer spending or buying habits could adversely affect the demand for our products. As in the past, we could experience reduced guest traffic or we may be unable or unwilling to increase the prices we can charge for our products to offset higher costs or fewer transactions, either of which could reduce our sales and profit margins. Also, landlords or other tenants in the shopping centers in which some of our restaurants are located may experience difficulty as a result of macroeconomic trends or cease to operate, which could in turn negatively affect guest traffic at our restaurants. All of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nOur success depends on our ability to compete with many food service businesses.\nThe restaurant industry is intensely competitive. We compete with many well-established food service companies on the basis of taste, quality and price of products offered, guest service, atmosphere, location, take-out and delivery options and overall guest experience. Our competitors include a large and diverse group of restaurant chains and individual restaurants that range from independent local operators that have opened restaurants in various markets to well-capitalized national restaurant companies. We also face competition from meal kit delivery services as well as the\nsupermarket industry. In addition, improving product offerings of fast casual and quick-service restaurants, together with negative economic conditions could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives. Many of our competitors or potential competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing, marketing and the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry better than we can. As our competitors expand their operations, we expect competition to intensify. We also compete with other restaurant chains and other retail establishments for quality site locations and employees.\nThe food service industry is affected by litigation and publicity concerning food quality, health and other issues, which can cause guests to avoid our restaurants and result in significant liabilities or litigation costs.\nFood service businesses can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from guests, consumer groups or government authorities resulting from food quality, illness, injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one restaurant or a limited number of restaurants. Adverse publicity about these allegations may negatively affect us, regardless of whether the allegations are true, by discouraging guests from eating at our restaurants. We could also incur significant liabilities if a lawsuit or claim results in a decision against us or litigation costs regardless of the result.\nOur business could be adversely affected by our inability to respond to or effectively manage social media.\nGiven the marked increase in the use of social media platforms along with smart phones in recent years, individuals have access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. The availability of information on social media platforms is virtually immediate as is its impact. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on the accuracy of the content posted. Information concerning our company may be posted on such platforms at any time. Information posted may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, each of which may harm our business. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs part of our marketing strategy, we utilize social media platforms to promote our brands and attract and retain guests. Our strategy may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without improvement in guest traffic or brand relevance. In addition, a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media, including improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about us, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, or dissemination of false information. The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.\nHealth and social concerns relating to the consumption of beef or other food products could affect consumer preferences and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nLike other restaurant chains, consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about the consumption of beef, the key ingredient in many of our menu items, or negative publicity concerning food quality and food safety, including food-borne illnesses. In addition, consumer preferences may be impacted by current and future menu-labeling requirements. A number of jurisdictions around the U.S. have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menu boards or make other nutritional information available. In May 2018, new federal disclosure requirements went into effect under PPACA requiring new menu nutritional labeling requirements. However, future regulatory action may occur as a result of the current political environment which could result in changes in the federal nutritional disclosure requirements. We cannot make any assurances regarding our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health perceptions and to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits. The imposition of menu-labeling laws could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as the restaurant industry in general. The labeling requirements and any negative publicity concerning any of the food products we serve may adversely affect demand for our food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants. If we react to the labeling requirements or negative publicity by changing our concept or our menu offerings or their ingredients, we may lose guests who do not prefer the new concept or products, and we may not be able to attract sufficient new guests to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. In addition, we may have different or additional competitors for our intended guests as a result of a change in our concept and may not be able to compete successfully against those competitors. A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or concept could materially harm our business.\nFood safety and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business by reducing demand and increasing costs.\nFood safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to help our guests enjoy safe, quality food products. However, food-borne illnesses and food safety issues occur in the food industry from time to time. Any report or publicity, whether true or not, linking us to instances of food-borne illness or other food safety issues, including food tampering or contamination, could adversely affect our brands and reputation as well as our revenue and profits. In addition, instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our revenue and profits.\nFurthermore, our reliance on third-party food suppliers and distributors increases the risk that food-borne illness incidents could be caused by factors outside of our control and that multiple locations would be affected rather than a single restaurant. We cannot assure that all food items are properly maintained during transport throughout the supply chain and that our employees will identify all products that may be spoiled and should not be used in our restaurants. If our guests become ill from food-borne illnesses, we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants. Furthermore, any instances of food contamination, whether or not at our restaurants, could subject us or our suppliers to a food recall.\nThe United States and other countries have experienced, or may experience in the future, outbreaks of viruses, such as Hepatitis A, Norovirus, Ebola, Avian Flu, SARS and H1N1. To the extent that a virus is food-borne, future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product. To the extent that a virus is transmitted by human-to-human contact, our employees or guests could become infected, or could choose, or be advised or required, to avoid gathering in public places, any one of which could adversely affect our business.\nThe possibility of future misstatement exists due to inherent limitations in our control systems, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe cannot be certain that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all possible error and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of error or fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely heavily on information technology, and any material failure, weakness or interruption could prevent us from effectively operating our business.\nWe rely heavily on information systems in all aspects of our operations, including point-of-sale systems, financial systems, marketing programs, cyber-security and various other processes and transactions. Our point-of-sale processing in our restaurants includes payment of obligations, collection of cash, credit and debit card transactions and other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. As our business needs continue to evolve, these systems will require upgrading and maintenance over time, consequently requiring significant future commitments of resources and capital. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, maintenance problems, upgrading or transitioning to new platforms could result in delays in guest service and reduce efficiency in our operations.\nWe outsource certain business processes to third-party vendors that subject us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs.\nSome business processes are currently outsourced to third parties. Such processes include information technology processes, gift card tracking, credit card authorization and processing, insurance claims processing, payroll tax filings, check payment processing, and other accounting processes. We also continue to evaluate our other business processes to determine if additional outsourcing is a viable option to accomplish our goals. We make a diligent effort to validate that all providers of outsourced services maintain customary internal controls, such as redundant processing facilities and adequate security frameworks to guard against breaches or data loss; however, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services or internal controls over their processes could have an\nadverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or ability to accomplish our financial and management reporting.\nWe may incur costs and adverse revenue consequences resulting from breaches of security related to confidential guest and/or employee information or the fraudulent use of credit cards.\nThe nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of information about our guests and employees. Hardware, software or other applications we develop and procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems and facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our employees or vendors. In addition, we accept electronic payment cards for payment in our restaurants. During 2018, approximately 79% of our transactions were by credit or debit cards, and such card usage could increase. Other retailers have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card along with employee information may have been stolen. We may in the future become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of alleged theft of guest and/or employee information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings relating to these types of incidents. Any such claim or proceeding could cause us to incur significant unplanned expenses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may result in material adverse revenue consequences for us and our restaurants.\nIn recent years, the payment card industry began to shift liability for certain transactions to retailers who are not able to accept Europay, Mastercard, and Visa (\"EMV\") chip card transactions. We are in the process of implementing EMV chip card technology. Until the implementation of EMV chip card technology is completed by us, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to additional transaction fees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to obtain and maintain licenses and permits necessary to operate our restaurants and compliance with governmental laws and regulations could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe restaurant industry is subject to various federal, state and local government regulations, including those relating to the sale of food and alcoholic beverages. Such regulations are subject to change from time to time, sometimes without notice to us. The failure to obtain and maintain these licenses, permits and approvals, including liquor licenses, could adversely affect our operating results. Difficulties or failure to obtain the required licenses and approvals could delay or result in our decision to cancel the opening of new restaurants. Local authorities may revoke, suspend or deny renewal of our liquor licenses if they determine that our conduct violates applicable regulations.\nIn addition to our having to comply with these licensing requirements, various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs. These laws include minimum and tipped wage requirements, overtime pay, health benefits, unemployment taxes, workers\u2019 compensation, work eligibility requirements and working conditions. A number of factors could adversely affect our operating results, including:\n\u00b7\nadditional government-imposed increases in minimum and/or tipped wages, overtime pay, paid leaves of absence, sick leave, and mandated health benefits;\n\u00b7\nincreased tax reporting and tax payment requirements for employees who receive gratuities;\n\u00b7\nany failure of our employees to comply with laws and regulations governing citizenship or residency requirements resulting in disruption of our work force and adverse publicity;\n\u00b7\na reduction in the number of states that allow gratuities to be credited toward minimum wage requirements; and\n\u00b7\nincreased employee litigation including claims under federal and/or state wage and hour laws.\nThe federal Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. Although our restaurants are designed to be accessible to the disabled, we could be required to make modifications to our restaurants to provide service to, or make reasonable accommodations, for disabled persons.\nOur failure or inability to enforce our trademarks or other proprietary rights could adversely affect our competitive position or the value of our brand.\nWe own certain common law trademark rights and a number of federal and international trademark and service mark registrations, including our trade names and logos, and proprietary rights relating to certain of our core menu offerings. We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. Therefore, we devote appropriate resources to the protection of our trademarks and proprietary rights. However, the protective actions that we take may not be enough to prevent unauthorized usage or imitation by others, which could harm our image, brand or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal fees. Our inability to register or protect our marks and other propriety rights in foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect our competitive position in international markets.\nWe cannot assure you that third parties will not claim that our trademarks or menu offerings infringe upon their proprietary rights. Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause delays in introducing new menu items in the future or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nWe are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us.\nIncreasing legal complexity will continue to affect our operations and results. We could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations, employment and personal injury claims, claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding consumer, workplace and employment matters, wage and hour claims, discrimination and similar matters, landlord/tenant disputes, disputes with current and former suppliers, claims by current and former franchisees, and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed upon another party\u2019s trademarks, copyrights or patents). Inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation which could result in significant judgments, including punitive and liquidated damages, and injunctive relief.\nOccasionally, our guests file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered as a result of a visit to our restaurants, or that we have problems with food quality or operations. In addition, we are subject to \"dram shop\" statutes. These statutes generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Some litigation against restaurant chains has resulted in significant judgments, including punitive damages, under dram shop statutes. Because a plaintiff may seek punitive damages, which may not be covered by insurance, this type of action could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation involving our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us for employment law purposes, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. We are also subject to the legal and compliance risks associated with privacy, data collection, protection and management, in particular as it relates to information we collect when we provide optional technology-related services to franchisees.\nOur operating results could also be affected by the following:\n\u00b7\nThe relative level of our defense costs and nature and procedural status of pending proceedings;\n\u00b7\nThe cost and other effects of settlements, judgments or consent decrees, which may require us to make disclosures or to take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products;\n\u00b7\nAdverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition and preparation of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices; and\n\u00b7\nThe scope and terms of insurance or indemnification protections that we may have.\nRegardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A judgment significantly in excess of any applicable insurance coverage could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt our business.\nOur current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims.\nWe currently maintain insurance customary for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure. Such damages could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or liquidity. In addition, we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our health, workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, employment practices liability and property insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nDecreased cash flow from operations, or an inability to access credit could negatively affect our business initiatives or may result in our inability to execute our revenue, expense, and capital allocation strategies.\nOur ability to fund our operating plans and to implement our capital allocation strategies depends on sufficient cash flow from operations and/or other financing, including the use of funding under our amended revolving credit facility. We also may seek access to the debt and/or equity capital markets. There can be no assurance, however, that these sources of financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. Our capital allocation strategies include, but are not limited to, new restaurant development, payment of dividends, refurbishment or relocation of existing restaurants, repurchases of our common stock and franchise acquisitions. If we experience decreased cash flow from operations, our ability to fund our operations and planned initiatives, and to take advantage of growth opportunities, may be delayed or negatively affected. In addition, these disruptions or a negative effect on our revenues could affect our ability to borrow or comply with our covenants under our amended revolving credit facility. If we are unable to raise additional capital, our growth could be impeded.\nOur existing credit facility limits our ability to incur additional debt.\nThe lenders\u2019 obligation to extend credit under our amended revolving credit facility depends on our maintaining certain financial covenants, including a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.00 to 1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. If we are unable to maintain these ratios, we would be unable to obtain additional financing under this amended revolving credit facility. The amended revolving credit facility permits us to incur additional secured or unsecured indebtedness outside the revolving credit facility, except for the incurrence of secured indebtedness that in the aggregate is equal to or greater than $125.0 million and 20% of our consolidated tangible net worth or circumstances where the incurrence of secured or unsecured indebtedness would prevent us from complying with our financial covenants. If we are unable to borrow additional capital, our growth could be impeded.\nWe may be required to record additional impairment charges in the future.\nIn accordance with accounting guidance as it relates to the impairment of long-lived assets, we make certain estimates and projections with regard to company restaurant operations, as well as our overall performance in connection with our impairment analyses for long-lived assets. When impairment triggers are deemed to exist for any company restaurant, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the restaurant are compared to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge would be recorded equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value.\nWe also review the value of our goodwill on an annual basis and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets may exceed the fair value of such assets. The estimates of fair value are based upon the best information available as of the date of the assessment and incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows and contemplate other valuation measurements and techniques.\nThe estimates of fair value used in these analyses require the use of judgment, certain assumptions and estimates of future operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates or assumptions, additional impairment charges may be required in the future. If impairment charges are significant, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFailure to retain the services of our key management personnel, or to successfully execute succession planning and attract additional qualified personnel could harm our business.\nOur future success depends on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel. Our future performance will depend on our ability to motivate and retain these and other key officers and managers, particularly regional market partners, market partners and managing partners. Competition for these employees is\nintense. The loss of the services of members of our senior management team or other key officers or managers or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed could materially harm our business. In addition, our business could suffer from the misconduct of any of our key personnel.\nOur franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.\nOur franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with Texas Roadhouse standards. We also provide training and support to franchisees. However, most franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and these franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants. As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards, the Texas Roadhouse image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure, Our Stock Ownership and Our Common Stock\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain several provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions include, among other things, advance notice for raising business or making nominations at meetings and \"blank check\" preferred stock. Blank check preferred stock enables our Board of Directors, without approval of the stockholders, to designate and issue additional series of preferred stock with such dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights, including the right to issue convertible securities with no limitations on conversion, as our Board of Directors may determine. The issuance of blank check preferred stock may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock as our Board of Directors may designate and issue preferred stock with terms that are senior to our common stock. These provisions may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock. These provisions also may delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their common stock.\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits us from engaging in \"business combinations\" with \"interested shareholders\" (with some exceptions) unless such transaction is approved in a prescribed manner. The existence of this provision could have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the Board of Directors, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock.\nPayment of cash dividends on our common stock is subject to compliance with applicable laws and depends on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Although we have paid dividends in the past, there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividends in the future.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our common stock.\nWe value constructive input from our stockholders and the investment community. Our Board of Directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders. There is no assurance that the actions taken by our Board of Directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with our stockholders will be successful.\nResponding to actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan. The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction also resulting from activist strategies could also affect the market price and volatility of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90427, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "TXRH"}
