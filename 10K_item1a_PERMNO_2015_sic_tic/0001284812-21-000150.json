{"cik": "1284812", "company": "COHEN & STEERS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur business, operations, and investments are subject to risks associated with and arising from epidemic diseases, such as the ongoing global outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19.\nCapital, equity, and credit markets, as well as the real estate and real property markets, have experienced and may continue to experience ongoing volatility and dislocations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The full scope and duration of the social, market, and economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic remains difficult to predict, and these conditions could worsen dramatically from those already experienced, including the possibility of a steep and prolonged economic downturn or global recession. Various parts of the globe experienced a resurgence in COVID-19 cases during the fourth quarter of 2020 which continued into 2021, a period during which newly detected variants of the disease also spread to several countries, leading to the re-implementation of lockdowns and other restrictions. A further resurgence of COVID-19, or an outbreak of any new, more virulent or more transmissible variants or mutations of the disease or other viral pathogens or epidemic diseases in any region could trigger broader and more severe health crises, market and economic turbulence, and governmental restrictions for a sustained period of time.\nIf we were to experience a sustained decline in the performance of the portfolios and strategies we manage as a result of negative market, financial, and economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our assets under management and the fees we earn in future periods could be adversely impacted. In addition, these market declines and disruptions could significantly reduce the demand for, and availability of, our investment products and services, and contribute to redemptions and withdrawals from our funds and the loss of institutional separate account clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and net income. Any actual or anticipated reduction in our profitability could impair our future dividend capacity and cash management policies and have a significant negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\nEpidemic diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic also pose continuing risk that we and our third-party intermediaries, service providers, and key vendors may be unable to provide services or conduct business activities or critical operations at full capacity for a period of time, including due to the spread of a disease or virus or restrictions or shutdowns that are requested or mandated by governmental authorities. These conditions could lead to operational issues and interruptions for the Company and certain of our products, require us to incur significant additional costs, and negatively impact our business. Both we and our third-party intermediaries, service providers, and key vendors are also subject to a heightened risk of cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents due to the ongoing remote working environment and prevalent use of virtual communication platforms.\nEpidemic diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic also present a significant threat to our employees\u2019 safety and welfare. Our key employees or executive officers may become sick or otherwise unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time. Precautionary measures we have taken to help minimize these risks during the COVID-19 pandemic, including our general implementation of a \u201cwork-from-home\u201d operating environment, could negatively affect our business, particularly our \u201cclient-facing\u201d operations, as well as employee productivity and human capital resources generally. In addition, continuing to carry out these precautionary measures, or implementing and carrying out additional precautionary or protective measures to respond to conditions or comply with regulations that have resulted or may result from the COVID-19 pandemic or other epidemic diseases, including rules and regulations applicable to any reopening or reuse of our offices, may result in the incurrence of significant additional costs and expenses by us and reduce our profitability.\nFurther, any re-entry of employees to the workplace or other use of our offices under pandemic or similar conditions, or resumption of other \u201cin-person\u201d business activities such as client meetings and business travel, may expose us to heightened risk of litigation. Such litigation may include claims of contraction of COVID-19 or other illnesses in the workplace or claims related to workplace safety, privacy, employment, or anti-discrimination laws and regulations. The threat or occurrence of any such litigation, or the circumstances giving rise to any such litigation, may consume significant amounts of our management\u2019s time and resources, result in regulatory investigation or sanction, increase our costs and expenses and reduce our profitability, as well as cause reputational harm.\nA decline in the absolute or relative performance or value of real estate securities, or the attractiveness of real estate portfolios or investment strategies, would have an adverse effect on the assets we manage and our revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 60.1% of the assets we managed were concentrated in real estate securities. Real estate securities and real property investments owned by the issuers of real estate securities are subject to varying degrees of risk that could affect investment performance. Returns on investments in real estate securities depend on the amount of income and capital appreciation or loss realized by the underlying real property. Income and real estate values may\nbe adversely affected by, among other things, unfavorable changes to tax laws and other laws and regulations applicable to real estate securities, the cost of compliance with applicable laws and regulations, interest rates, the availability of financing, the creditworthiness of tenants, and the limited ability of issuers of real estate securities to vary their portfolios promptly in response to changes in market conditions. The financial performance and underlying valuations of certain areas of the real estate market, including without limitation office and retail shopping locations, residential rental property, and real estate concentrated in urban areas, were severely affected and may continue to be affected by the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. If the underlying properties do not generate sufficient income to pay for ongoing operating expenses, the income and the ability of an issuer of real estate securities to pay interest and principal on debt securities or any dividends on common or preferred stocks will be adversely affected. A decline in the performance or value of real estate securities would have an adverse effect on the assets we manage and reduce the fees we earn and our revenue.\nOur growth and the execution of our real estate investment strategy may be constrained by the size and number of real estate securities issuers, as well as REIT ownership restrictions.\nInvestments in real estate securities continue to play an important role in our overall investment strategy. Our ability to fully utilize our investment capacity and continue to increase our ownership of real estate securities depends, in part, on growth in the size and number of issuers in the real estate securities market, particularly in the U.S. Limited growth, or any consolidation activity in the real estate sector, could limit or reduce the number of investment opportunities otherwise available to us. In addition, increased competition for investment opportunities due to large amounts of available capital dedicated to real estate strategies, or a real or perceived trend towards merger and acquisition activity in the sector, could affect real estate valuations and prices. A limited number of investment targets could adversely impact our ability to make new investments based on fundamental valuations or at all, impair the full utilization of our overall investment capacity, and otherwise negatively affect our investment strategy.\nOur ability to increase our ownership, or maintain existing levels of ownership, may also be constrained by REIT ownership limits, which limit the percentage ownership of a REIT\u2019s outstanding capital stock, common stock, and/or preferred stock. REIT charters generally grant a REIT the right to unilaterally reduce any ownership amount that it deems to be in violation of its ownership limits. Such charters do not typically provide for the elimination of such right even in the event a REIT has previously provided waivers from such limits or acknowledgements that ownership levels do not violate such limits. To the extent these ownership restrictions prevent us from acquiring new or additional real estate securities, or force us to reduce existing ownership amounts, our revenue and our ability to invest available assets and increase the assets we manage could be negatively affected.\nA decline in the absolute or relative performance or value of preferred securities, or the attractiveness of preferred securities portfolios or investment strategies, would have an adverse effect on the assets we manage and our revenue.\nThe amount of assets we manage in our preferred securities strategies has grown significantly in recent years. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 29.0% of our total assets under management, including 14.1% in the Cohen & Steers Preferred Securities and Income Fund alone, was concentrated in these strategies. Our preferred securities investments are subject to varying degrees of market, contractual, financial, regulatory, and other risks that could affect investment performance and attractiveness, including risks related to interest rates, counterparty credit, income and distributions, and applicable tax treatment. Certain components of our preferred securities portfolios may also be subject to risks related to the expected discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate, or \u201cLIBOR,\u201d and uncertainty around the identification and use of alternative reference rates. See \u201cThe expected discontinuation of LIBOR, and uncertainty around the identification and use of alternative reference rates, may adversely affect the value of certain LIBOR-based assets we manage and expose us to additional risks.\u201d Further, to the extent limitations may arise in the overall supply of preferred securities investments at attractive prices or at all, whether due to performance concerns about the asset class, shifts in market trends or investor preferences, redemptions, or decreased volume of new issuances, our ability to deploy our available investment capacity may become constrained. A decline in the performance or value of preferred securities, or diminishment in the attractiveness or availability of preferred securities investments, would have an adverse effect on the assets we manage, limit our ability to increase and invest assets in these strategies, and reduce the fees we earn and our revenue.\nA significant portion of our revenue for 2020 was derived from a single institutional client.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our largest institutional client, Daiwa Asset Management, which held most of its assets in U.S. REIT strategies subadvised by us in Japan, represented approximately 6.7% of our total revenue for 2020. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 27.9% of the institutional account assets we managed, and approximately 11.6% of our total assets under management were derived from this client. Investor demand for the products we subadvise for this client\ncan be affected by, among other things, changes in the distributions paid by those products, the strength of the Japanese yen compared to the currencies in which the assets held in those products are denominated, and the market and regulatory environment in the Japanese mutual fund market. Changes in the distribution rates could decrease investor demand for these products, resulting in outflows of assets subadvised by us which would negatively impact our revenue and adversely affect our financial condition.\nSeed investments made to support the launch of new strategies and products may expose us to potential losses on invested capital.\nOur success is partially dependent on our ability to develop, launch, market, and manage new investment strategies and products. From time to time, we support the launch of new investment strategies and products by making seed investments in those strategies and products. Numerous risks and uncertainties are associated with all stages of the seed investment product life cycle, including investment performance, market risks, shifting client or market preferences, the introduction of competing products, compliance with regulatory requirements, and, in some cases, potentially illiquid investments and/or contractual lock-up or other restrictions on our ability to withdraw capital. Seed investments in new strategies and products utilize capital that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes and expose us to potential capital losses, against which we may not hedge entirely. To the extent we realize losses on our seed investments, our earnings and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nThe loss of any members of our senior management team or our failure to manage executive succession could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe success of our business depends largely on the experience, expertise and continued service of our executive management team. The loss of any members of our senior management team, or our failure to adequately prepare for the succession and retention of our executive management team or to effectively implement executive succession plans, could materially adversely affect our business, strategic initiatives and financial condition. While we have succession plans in place for members of our executive management team, and continue to review and update those plans, there is no guarantee that their implementation or execution will operate as intended or otherwise be effective. In addition, we do not carry \u201ckey person\u201d or similar insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of any of the members of our management team.\nOn February 21, 2021, our company experienced a significant transition in executive leadership roles and responsibilities when Robert H. Steers, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and a member of our board of directors, took a medical leave of absence. In connection with Mr. Steers\u2019 leave of absence, our board of directors appointed Joseph M. Harvey, our President and a member of our board of directors, as Acting Chief Executive Officer. The effectiveness of this transition, and any further transition, could have a significant impact on our business.\nRegulations restricting the use of commission credits to pay for research have increased, and may continue to increase, our operating expenses.\nOn behalf of our clients, we make decisions to buy and sell securities, select broker-dealers to execute trades, and negotiate brokerage commission rates. In connection with these transactions and subject to best execution, we receive commission credits to pay for eligible research and services from broker-dealers and other eligible service providers. As a result of regulations in the European Union, we eliminated the use of commission credits to pay for research and eligible services for accounts where we had obligations directly within the scope of MiFID II (together with substantially similar national rules of the U.K. and implementing rules and regulations). Our operating expenses include payment for research and eligible services for these accounts.\nDepending on the evolution of market practices and regulatory developments, we may elect to pay for research and expenses globally, subject to applicable SEC regulations, which would further increase our operating expenses.\nWe face substantial competition in all aspects of our business.\nThe investment management industry is highly competitive, and investors are increasingly fee sensitive. We compete against a large number of investment products offered by other investment management companies, investment dealers, banks, and insurance companies, and many institutions we compete with have greater financial resources than us. We compete with these firms on the basis of investment performance, diversity of products, distribution capability, scope and quality of services, reputation, and the ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors.\nOur actively managed investment strategies compete not only against other active strategies but also against similarly positioned passive strategies. The continuing shift in market demand toward index funds and other passive strategies, and the growing availability of investment options to meet these demands, reduces opportunities for active managers and may accelerate fee compression. In the event that competitors charge lower fees for substantially similar products, we may be forced to compete on the basis of price in order to attract and retain clients. In order to maintain our current fee structure in a competitive environment, we must be able to provide clients with investment returns and service commensurate with the level of fees we charge. To the extent current or potential clients decide to invest in products sponsored by our competitors, the sales of our products as well as our market share, revenue, and net income could decline.\nThe inability to access clients through third-party intermediaries could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA significant portion of the assets we manage is attributable to the distribution of our products through third-party intermediaries. Our ability to distribute our products is highly dependent on access to the client bases and product platforms of international, national and regional securities firms, investment advisory firms, banks, insurance companies, defined contribution plan administrators, and other intermediaries, which generally offer competing investment products that could limit the distribution of our products. In addition, our separate account business, subadvisory, and model delivery services depend in part on recommendations by consultants, financial planners, and other professional advisors, as well as our existing clients.\nThe structure and terms of the distribution arrangements with intermediaries, including fees or rebates paid by us or our funds to intermediaries to assist with distribution efforts, and the ability of our funds to participate in these intermediary platforms are subject to changes driven by market competition and regulatory developments. Our existing relationships with third-party intermediaries and access to new intermediaries could be adversely affected by continued consolidation within the financial services industry. Consolidation may result in increased distribution costs, a reduction in the number of third parties distributing our investment products, or increased competition to access third-party distribution channels. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain access to these channels. Loss of any of these third-party distribution channels, or changes to their structure and terms, or any reduction in our ability to access clients and investors through existing and new distribution channels, could adversely affect our business.\nOur growth could be adversely affected if we are unable to manage the costs or realize the anticipated benefits associated with the expansion of our business.\nOur growth strategy continues to involve expanding our business and diversifying our investment management business to include products and services outside of investments in real estate securities. As part of the implementation of our strategy, we have emphasized the development of broader real assets strategies and have expanded our geographical presence and capabilities as well as product and service offerings outside the U.S. As a result, our fixed costs and other expenses have increased to support the development and launch of new strategies and products, to expand the availability and marketability of our existing strategies and products, to grow our potential client base, and to enhance our infrastructure, including additional office space, technology, operations, and personnel.\nDeveloping and implementing new investment strategies and products may require significant upfront management time and attention, the hiring of highly-compensated personnel, seed capital commitments, and other financial resources, including potential subsidies of operating expenses for an extended period of time, as well as ongoing marketing and other support. The success of our business strategy and future growth is contingent upon our ability to continue to support and invest in the development of new strategies and products, to generate sufficient assets under management and fee revenue at the levels and within the timeframe anticipated in order to support the compensation and other costs and expenses underlying such new strategies and products, to expand the availability of our existing strategies and products, and to successfully manage multiple offices and navigate legal and regulatory systems both domestically and internationally. The upfront and ongoing costs of adequately supporting such growth and initiatives will have an effect on our operating margin and other financial results.\nOur clients may withdraw or reduce the amount of assets we manage or otherwise change the terms of our relationship, which could have an adverse impact on our revenue.\nOur institutional clients, and firms with which we have strategic alliances, may terminate their relationship with us, reduce the amount of assets we manage, shift their assets to other types of accounts with different fee structures, or renegotiate the fees we charge them for any number of reasons, including investment performance, redemptions by beneficial owners of funds we manage or subadvise, actual or perceived competition between the accounts we subadvise and our proprietary investment products, changes in the key members of an investment team, changes in prevailing interest rates, and\nfinancial market performance. Certain investors in the funds we manage hold their shares indirectly through platforms sponsored by financial institutions that have the authority to make investment and asset allocation decisions on behalf of such investors. Decisions by investors to redeem assets may require selling investments at a disadvantageous time or price, which could negatively affect the amount of our assets under management or our ability to continue to pursue certain investment strategies. In a declining market or in conditions of poor relative or absolute performance, the pace of redemptions and withdrawals and the loss of institutional and individual separate account clients could accelerate. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our revenue.\nLimitations on our ability to utilize leverage in the closed-end funds we sponsor could reduce our assets under management and revenue.\nCertain of the closed-end funds sponsored by us utilize leverage in the form of bank financing, which in the aggregate amounted to approximately $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2020. To the extent any closed-end fund sponsored by us elects or is required by regulation or the terms of its bank financing to reduce leverage, such fund may need to liquidate its investments. Reducing leverage or liquidating investments during adverse market conditions would reduce the Company\u2019s assets under management and revenue.\nWe could incur financial losses, reputational harm and regulatory penalties if we fail to implement effective information security policies and procedures.\nOur business is dependent on the effectiveness of our information and cyber security policies and procedures to protect our network and telecommunications systems and the data that reside in or are transmitted through such systems. As part of our normal operations, we maintain and transmit confidential information about our employees and clients\u2019 portfolios as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations. We maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity, including misappropriation of our assets, fraudulent financial reporting, and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential information is either prevented or timely detected and remediated. However, our technology systems may still be vulnerable to unauthorized access or may be corrupted by cyberattacks, computer viruses or other malicious software code, or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information. The nature of these threats is constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated. Although we take precautions to password protect and encrypt our employees\u2019 mobile electronic devices, if such devices are stolen, misplaced or left unattended, they may become vulnerable to hacking or other unauthorized use, creating a possible security risk. Like other companies, we have experienced, and will continue to experience, ongoing cyber security threats and attacks. During 2020, we experienced a cyber incident which did not materially impact our operations and has subsequently been addressed. There can be no assurance that our efforts to maintain and monitor the security and integrity of our information technology systems will be effective at all times.\nAny breach or other failure of our or certain other parties\u2019 technology systems, including those systems of service providers, key vendors, and third parties with whom we do business, could result in the loss of valuable information, liability for stolen assets or information, remediation costs to repair damage caused by the incident, additional security costs to mitigate against future incidents, regulatory penalties, and litigation costs resulting from the incident. In addition, our increased use of mobile and cloud technologies could increase these and other operational risks, and any failure by mobile or cloud technology service providers to adequately safeguard their systems could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption, or loss of confidential or proprietary information.\nFor many companies, remote work arrangements resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have made their network and communication systems more vulnerable to cyberattacks and incursions, and there has been an overall increase in both the frequency and severity of cyber incidents as such vulnerabilities have been exploited. Our remote work environment subjects us to heightened risk of cyberattacks, unauthorized access, or other privacy or data security incidents, both directly as well as indirectly through third-party intermediaries, service providers, and key vendors that have access or other connections to our systems.\nLoss of confidential client information could harm our reputation, result in the termination of contracts by our existing clients, and subject us to litigation or liability under laws and agreements that protect confidential and personal data, resulting in increased costs and/or loss of revenues. We maintain a cyber insurance policy to help mitigate against any potential losses relating to information security breaches. However, such insurance may only partially reimburse us for our losses, if at all, and if a claim is successful and exceeds or is not covered by our insurance policy, we may be required to pay a substantial amount to satisfy such successful claim.\nThe expected discontinuation of LIBOR, and uncertainty around the identification and use of alternative reference rates, may adversely affect the value of certain LIBOR-based assets we manage and expose us to additional risks.\nLIBOR is the offered rate for short-term Eurodollar deposits between major international banks. LIBOR is used as a reference rate for various financial instruments, products and contracts globally to determine payment obligations, financing terms, hedging strategies, or investment value. In 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that the continuation of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed after the end of calendar 2021. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, announced a plan to extend the date as of which most U.S. LIBOR values would cease being computed from December 31, 2021 to June 30, 2023. Regulators and industry working groups have suggested alternative reference rates, but global consensus has not been achieved, and the potential for further regulatory changes addressing the use of LIBOR remains unclear.\nAny market transition away from LIBOR in its current form will be complex and introduce a number of risks for us, our clients, and the financial services industry more widely. These include legal implementation risks, as extensive changes to documentation for new and existing clients and transactions may be required, financial risks arising from any changes in the valuation of financial instruments linked to benchmarks, pricing risks, as changes to benchmarks could impact pricing mechanisms on some instruments, operational risks due to the potential requirement to adapt information technology systems, trade reporting infrastructure and operational processes, and relationship risks relating to client communications and engagement during the transition away from LIBOR or other financial benchmarks currently utilized. The transition away from LIBOR may lead to increased volatility and illiquidity in markets and investments tied to LIBOR, and any alternative reference rate may be an ineffective substitute resulting in prolonged adverse market conditions, which would negatively impact our investments and which may result in the reduced effectiveness of our hedging strategies.\nFailure to maintain adequate business continuity plans could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its products.\nSignificant portions of our business operations and those of our critical third-party service providers are concentrated in a few geographic areas, including New York and New Jersey. Critical operations that are geographically concentrated in New York include portfolio management, trading operations, information technology, investment administration, and portfolio accounting services for our products as well as corporate accounting systems. Should we, or any of our critical service providers, experience a significant local or regional disaster or other significant business disruption, our ability to remain operational will depend in part on the safety and availability of our personnel, our office facilities, and the proper functioning of our network, telecommunication, and other related systems and operations. We have backup systems and contingency plans, but we cannot ensure that they will be adequate under all circumstances or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur. In addition, we rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for disaster recovery support, and we cannot guarantee that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner. Failure by us, or any of our critical service providers, to maintain up-to-date business continuity plans, including system backup facilities, would impede our ability to operate in the event of a significant business disruption, which could result in financial losses to the Company and our clients and investors.\nWe could experience loss of client relationships if our reputation is harmed.\nOur reputation is important to the success of our business. We believe that the Cohen & Steers brand has been, and continues to be, well received globally both in our industry and with our clients, reflecting the fact that our brand, like our business, is based in part on trust and confidence. Our reputation may be harmed by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, poor investment performance, operational failures, cyber incidents, negative publicity, claims, or disputes arising from our management of COVID-19 or other pandemic conditions, the dissemination by current or former clients of unfavorable opinions about our services, changes in key members of an investment team or changes in our senior management, and the imposition of legal or regulatory sanctions or penalties in connection with our business activities. If our reputation is harmed, existing clients and investors may reduce amounts held in, or withdraw entirely from, funds or accounts that we manage, or funds or accounts may terminate their relationship with us. In addition, reputational harm may cause us to lose current employees and we may be unable to attract new ones with similar qualifications or skills, which could negatively affect our operations. If we fail to address, or appear to fail to address, successfully and promptly, the underlying causes of any reputational harm, we may be unsuccessful in repairing any damage to our reputation and our future business prospects would likely be affected, and the loss of client relationships could reduce our assets under management, revenue and earnings.\nThe failure of a key vendor to fulfill its obligations to the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its products.\nWe depend on a number of key vendors for various fund administration, fund and corporate accounting, custody and transfer agent services, information technology services, market data, and other operational needs. The failure or inability of the Company to establish backup for key services or the failure of any key vendor to fulfill its obligations for any reason, including those that may be beyond our or such vendor\u2019s control, could lead to operational issues for the Company and certain of its products, which could result in financial losses for the Company and its clients.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nA significant portion of our common stock is owned or controlled by our Chief Executive Officer and our Chairman and their respective family members, which may limit the ability of other stockholders to influence the affairs of the Company.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and a member of his family beneficially owned or controlled approximately 24.6% of our common stock as of December 31, 2020. In addition, our Chairman and a member of his family beneficially owned or controlled approximately 20.4% of our common stock as of December 31, 2020. Such levels of ownership or control create the ability to meaningfully influence, among other things:\n\u2022the election of members of our board of directors, thereby indirectly influencing the management and affairs of the Company;\n\u2022the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders; and\n\u2022any unsolicited acquisition of us and, consequently, potentially adversely affect the market price of our common stock or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium on their shares.\nThe interests of one or more of such persons may differ from those of other stockholders in instances where, for example, management compensation is being determined or where an unsolicited acquisition of us could result in a change in our management. The concentration of beneficial ownership in such persons may limit the ability of our other stockholders to influence the affairs of the Company.\nWe may change our dividend policy at any time and there is no guarantee that we will pay dividends in the future.\nAlthough we have a long history of paying regular and special cash dividends, there is no guarantee or requirement that we pay cash dividends in the future. Our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders. The declaration and amount of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and in accordance with applicable law and only after taking into account various factors that our board of directors deems relevant, including our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity, current and anticipated cash needs and capital requirements, and potential alternative uses of cash. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will pay dividends at any rate or at all.\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and the issuance of additional shares will dilute your percentage ownership in the Company.\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sale may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chairman, together with certain of their respective family members, beneficially owned or controlled 11,746,364 shares and 9,728,847 shares, respectively, of our common stock as of December 31, 2020. Any of such persons may sell shares of our common stock in the open market, subject to any restrictions imposed by U.S. federal securities laws on sales by affiliates.\nIn connection with our initial public offering in 2004, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with our Chief Executive Officer and our Chairman and certain trust entities controlled by certain of their respective family members that requires us to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, shares of our common stock (and other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of common stock) held by them under certain circumstances. In May 2018, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 covering (i) the resale of up to an aggregate of 22,911,757 shares owned or controlled by our Chief Executive Officer and our Chairman and certain other persons and (ii) the offer and sale of an indeterminate number of shares by us to the public. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and any additional shares that we issue will dilute your percentage ownership in the Company.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain certain anti-takeover provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of the Company without negotiating with our board of directors. Such provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for the Company\u2019s common stock. Certain of these provisions allow the Company to issue preferred stock with rights more senior to those of our common stock, impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions, and set forth rules about how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at annual meetings.\nWe believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or other unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess acquisition proposals. However, these provisions apply even if an acquisition proposal may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition. In the event that our board of directors determines that a potential business combination transaction would be beneficial to the Company and its stockholders, such stockholders may elect to sell their shares in the Company and the trading price of our common stock could decrease.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory changes in the U.S. and internationally.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to new regulations and revisions to, and evolving interpretations of, existing regulations in the U.S. and internationally. In recent years, regulators in the U.S. and abroad have increased oversight of the financial services industry, which may result in regulation that increases the Company\u2019s cost of conducting its business and maintaining its global compliance standards or limit or change the Company\u2019s current or prospective business.\nU.S. regulatory agencies have proposed and adopted multiple regulations that could impact the mutual fund industry. The SEC\u2019s final rules and amendments that modernize reporting and disclosure, along with other potential upcoming regulations, could, among other things, restrict the funds we manage from engaging in certain transactions, impact flows, and/or increase expenses as well as compliance costs.\nIn Europe, rules and regulations under MiFID II and MiFIR, along with substantially similar national rules of the U.K. and implementing rules and regulations, have had, and will continue to have, direct and indirect effects on our operations in Europe, including increased costs for investment research and increased compliance, disclosure, reporting, and other obligations. In addition, European and international regulations and rules around environmental, social, and governance disclosures are expected to have direct and indirect effects on our global operations, including increased costs for increased compliance through disclosure and reporting, among other obligations.\nThere has been an increase in data and privacy regulations globally. In addition to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), U.S. state data breach and privacy legislation, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, have come into effect requiring us to comply with stringent requirements, and we expect that there will be further regulation and legislation that will come into effect in the future that will require us to comprehensively review our systems and processes and may result in additional costs.\nThe U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union on January 31, 2020 (referred to as Brexit) and end of the transition period on December 31, 2020 may continue to disrupt our business operations and impact our reported financial results as well as the liquidity and value of our investments. Brexit has caused significant geo-political and legal uncertainty and market volatility in the U.K. and elsewhere, which may continue during continued negotiations between the U.K. and Europe. CSUK\u2019s ability to market and provide its services or serve as a distributor of financial products within the European Union could be restricted temporarily or in the long term as a result of Brexit. Our contingency plans for Brexit require the cooperation of counterparties or a regulator of financial services to make timely arrangements. While we believe it is in the best interests of counterparties and regulators to cooperate, we cannot guarantee that counterparties or regulators will cooperate or the timeliness of their cooperation. Our operating expenses have increased as we implement our plan to continue to market and provide our services and distribute our products in the short and/or long term.\nThe expected discontinuation of LIBOR and uncertainty around the identification and use of alternative reference rates introduces a number of risks for us, our clients, and the financial services industry more widely. See \u201cThe expected discontinuation of LIBOR, and uncertainty around the identification and use of alternative reference rates, may adversely affect the value of certain LIBOR-based assets we manage and expose us to additional risks.\u201d\nAlthough the full extent of the foregoing regulatory changes is still unclear, they may affect our business operations and increase our operating expenses.\nOur involvement in legal proceedings could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nMany aspects of our business involve risks of legal liability. Claims against us may arise in the ordinary course of business, including employment-related claims, and from time to time, we may receive subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. and non-U.S. governmental or regulatory authorities and third parties in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific, or other investigations or proceedings. In addition, certain funds we manage may become subject to lawsuits, any of which could potentially impact the investment returns of the applicable fund.\nWe carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate to cover potential liabilities related to litigation. However, we cannot guarantee that our insurance will cover all liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed, or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees. As our insurance policies are due for renewal, we may need to assume higher deductibles or pay higher premiums, which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income.\nThe tax treatment of certain of our funds involves the interpretation of complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no precedent may be available and may be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment of certain of our funds depends in some instances on determinations of fact and interpretations of complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. U.S. federal income tax rules are constantly under review by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, frequently resulting in revised interpretations of established concepts, statutory changes, revisions to regulations, and other modifications and interpretations. Recent and ongoing changes to U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof could cause us to change our investments and commitments, affect the tax considerations of an investment in us and our funds, and change the character or treatment of portions of our income. In addition, the Company may be required to make certain assumptions when electing a particular tax treatment. It is possible that the IRS could assert successfully that the assumptions made by us do not satisfy the technical requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and/or Treasury Regulations and could require items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit, including interest deductions, be adjusted, reallocated, or disallowed in a manner that adversely affects us and our clients.", "PERMNO": 90303, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "CNS"}
