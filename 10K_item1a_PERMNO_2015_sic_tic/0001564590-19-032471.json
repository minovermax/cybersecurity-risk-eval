The following material risk factors may cause our future results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. You should carefully consider these factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when evaluating an investment in our securities.\nInvestments in future markets of potential significant growth may not result in the expected return.\nWe continue to make investments in programs with the goal of gaining a greater share of end markets using semiconductor lasers and other components including those used for 3D sensing and emerging 5G technology. We cannot guarantee that our investments in capital and capabilities will be sufficient. The potential end markets, as well as our ability to gain market share in such markets, may not materialize on the timeline anticipated or at all. We cannot be sure of the end market price, specification or yield for products incorporating our technologies. Our technologies could fail to fulfill, partially or completely, our target customers\u2019 specifications. We cannot guarantee the end market customers\u2019 acceptance of our technologies. Further, we may be unable to fulfill the terms of our contracts with our target customers, which could result in penalties of a material nature, including damages, loss of market share and loss of reputation.\nOur competitive position depends on our ability to develop new products and processes.\nTo meet our strategic objectives, we must develop, manufacture and market new products and continue to update our existing products and processes to keep pace with market developments to address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. Our success in developing and selling new and enhanced products and processes depends upon a variety of factors including strategic product selection, efficient completion of product design and development, timely implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes, effective sales and marketing, and high-quality and successful product performance in the market.\nThe introduction by our competitors of products or processes using new developments better or faster than ours could render our products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. We intend to continue to make significant investments in RD&E to achieve our goals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and maintain our competitive position and on our results of operations and/or financial condition.\nGlobal economic downturns may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nCurrent and future conditions in the global economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction of the global economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors and regions of the economy, including the industrial, aerospace and defense, optical communications, telecommunications, semiconductor, and medical and life science markets in which we participate. All aspects of our company forecast depend on estimates of growth or contraction in the markets we serve. Thus, prevailing global economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures very difficult to make.\nGlobal economic downturns may affect industries in which our customers operate. These changes could include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers\u2019 products. Such conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for our customers\u2019 products, and in turn, on demand for our products.\nAdverse changes may occur in the future as a result of declining or flat global or regional economic conditions, fluctuations in currency and commodity prices, wavering confidence, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment, decline in stock markets, contraction of credit availability or other factors affecting economic conditions. For example, factors that may affect our operating results include disruption in the credit and financial markets in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, adverse effects of slowdowns in the U.S., European or Chinese economies, reductions or limited growth in consumer spending or consumer credit, global trade tariffs, and other adverse economic conditions that may be specific to the Internet, e-commerce and payments industries.\nAdverse changes could also occur as a result of economic upswings, such as increased wages and scarce labor pools, and increased interest rates.\nThese changes may negatively affect sales of products and increase exposure to losses from bad debt and commodity prices, the cost and availability of financing, and costs associated with manufacturing and distributing products. Any economic downturn, or surge, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nSome systems that use our products are complex in design, and our products may contain defects that are not detected until deployed, which could increase our costs, reduce our revenues, cause us to lose key customers and may expose us to litigation arising from lawsuits related to our products.\nSome systems that use our products are inherently complex in design and require ongoing maintenance. Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors which may contain defects. Should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to correct defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things, loss of customers, increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses, damage to our brand reputation, failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance, diversion of development and engineering resources, or legal action by our customers.\nThe occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nForeign currency risk may negatively affect our revenues, cost of sales and operating margins and could result in foreign exchange losses.\nWe conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate. Our net sales outside the United States represented a majority of our total sales in each of the last three fiscal years. We incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it operates or holds assets or liabilities in a currency different than its functional currency. Changes in exchange rates can also affect our results of operations when the value of sales and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. We cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations. Further, given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be able to effectively manage our currency risks, and any volatility in currency exchange rates may increase the price of our products in local currency to our foreign customers or increase the manufacturing cost of our products, either of which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and profitability.\nOur competitive position may still require significant investments.\nWe continuously monitor the marketplace for strategic opportunities, and our business strategy includes expanding our product lines and markets through both internal product development and acquisitions. Consequently, we expect to continue to consider strategic acquisition of businesses, products or technologies complementary to our business. This may require significant investments of management time and financial resources. If market demand is outside our organic capabilities, if a strategic acquisition is required and we cannot identify one or execute on it, and/or if financial investments that we undertake distract management, do not result in the expected return on investment, expose us to unforeseen liabilities or jeopardize our ability to comply with our credit facility covenants due to any inability to integrate the business, adjust to operating a larger and more complex organization, adapt to additional political and other requirements associated with the acquired business, retain staff, or work with customers, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement our acquisitions strategy or integrate acquired companies and personnel with existing operations.\nWe have in the past acquired several companies, and our announced acquisition of Finisar is pending. We may continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions. We may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for many reasons, including increasing competition from other potential acquirers, the effects of consolidation in our industries, and potentially high valuations of acquisition candidates. In addition, applicable antitrust laws and other regulations may limit our ability to acquire targets or force us to divest an acquired business line. If we are unable to identify suitable targets or complete acquisitions, our growth prospects may suffer, and we may not be able to realize sufficient scale and technological advantages to compete effectively in all markets.\nTo the extent we are successful in making acquisitions, we may be unsuccessful in integrating acquired companies or product lines with existing operations, or the integration may be more difficult or more costly than anticipated. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize anticipated benefits from acquired companies, businesses or assets include those associated with:\n\u2022\nunexpected losses of key employees of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nconforming the acquired company\u2019s standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations, including integrating Enterprise Resource Planning (\u201cERP\u201d) systems and other key business applications;\n\u2022\ncoordinating new product and process development;\n\u2022\nincreasing complexity from combining operations;\n\u2022\nincreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how; and\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns.\nIn connection with acquisitions, we may:\n\u2022\nuse a signification portion of our available cash;\n\u2022\nissue equity securities, which would dilute current shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u2022\nincur significant debt;\n\u2022\nincur or assume contingent liabilities, known or unknown, including potential lawsuits, infringement actions or similar liabilities;\n\u2022\nincur impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangibles; and\n\u2022\nface antitrust or other regulatory inquiries or actions.\nIn addition, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected if the effect of any acquisitions on our consolidated financial results is dilutive or is below the market's or financial analysts' expectations, or if there are unanticipated changes in the business or financial performance of the target company or the combined company. Any failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses may disrupt our business and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success depends on continued international sales, and our global operations are complex, and present multiple challenges to manage.\nSales to customers in countries other than the United States accounted for approximately 70%, 68% and 69% of revenues during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. If we do not maintain our current volume of international sales, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nWe manufacture products in the United States, China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, and through a contract manufacturer in Thailand. We also maintain direct sales offices in Hong Kong, Japan, Germany, China, Switzerland, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Italy, South Korea, and Taiwan. Our operations vary by location and are influenced on a location-by-location basis by local customs, languages and work practices, as well as different local weather conditions, management styles and education systems. In addition, multiple complex issues may arise concurrently in different countries, potentially hampering our management\u2019s ability to respond in an effective and timely manner. Any inability to respond in an effective and timely manner to issues in our global operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to complex and rapidly changing import and export regulations.\nWe are subject to the passage of and changes in the interpretation of regulation by U.S. government entities at the federal, state and local levels and non-U.S. agencies, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nWe are required to comply with import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our ability to enter into or complete transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. We may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item, and granting of a required license cannot be assured. Compliance with the import laws that apply to our businesses may restrict our access to, and may increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and could interrupt our supply of imported inventory.\n\u2022\nExported technologies necessary to develop and manufacture certain products are subject to U.S. export control laws and similar laws of other jurisdictions. We may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences, including government oversight of facilities and export transactions, monetary penalties and other sanctions for violations of these laws. In certain instances, these regulations may prohibit the Company from developing or manufacturing certain of its products for specific applications outside the United States. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies could impact the Company\u2019s international operations and the cost of goods imported into the United States, which may narrow the size of our markets, materially impact our revenues or increase our operating costs and expose us to contract litigation.\nIn March 2018, President Trump announced new steel and aluminum tariffs, in April 2018, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued a denial order against two companies in the telecommunications market, and in May 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce placed Huawei and its affiliates on the U.S. Entity List. Other international trade actions and initiatives also have been implemented, notably the imposition by the U.S. of additional tariffs on products of Chinese origin, and China\u2019s imposition of additional tariffs on U.S.-origin goods. If we cannot obtain relief from, or if we cannot take other action to mitigate the impact of, these additional restrictions and duties, our business and profits may be materially and adversely affected. Further changes in the trade policy of the United States or of other countries with which we do cross-border business, or additional sanctions, could result in retaliatory actions by other countries that could materially and negatively impact the volume of economic activity in the United States or globally, which, in turn, may decrease our access to customers and markets, reduce our revenues, and increase our operating costs.\nExports of certain of our products are subject to export controls imposed by the U.S. Government and administered by the U.S. Departments of State and Commerce. In certain instances, these regulations may require pre-shipment authorization from the administering department. For products subject to the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, administered by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security, the requirement for a license is dependent on the type and end use of the product, the final destination, the identity of the end user and whether a license exception might apply. Virtually all exports of products subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, administered by the Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, require a license. Certain of our fiber optics products are subject to EAR controls and we historically have sold some\nproducts, including certain products developed with government funding, subject to ITAR. Products developed and manufactured in our foreign locations are subject to export controls of the applicable foreign nation. Given the current global political climate, obtaining export licenses can be difficult and time-consuming. Failure to obtain export licenses for these shipments, or having one or more of our customers be restricted from receiving exports from us, could significantly reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Compliance with regulations of the United States and other governments also subjects us to additional fees and costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. We have previously been the subject of inquiries from the Department of State and the Department of Justice regarding compliance with ITAR. Although these inquiries were closed with no action being taken, we expended significant time and resources to resolve them, and future inquiries of this type could also be costly to resolve.\nAny inability to access financial markets from time to time to raise required capital, finance our working capital requirements or our acquisition strategies, or otherwise to support our liquidity needs could negatively impact our ability to finance our operations, meet certain obligations or implement our growth strategy.\nWe borrow under our existing credit facilities to fund operations, including working capital investments, and to finance our acquisition strategies. In the past, market disruptions experienced in the United States and abroad have materially impacted liquidity in the credit and debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive, and, in certain cases, have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. Uncertainty in the financial markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing or to refinance our existing credit facilities or existing debt arrangements on favorable terms or at all, which could negatively affect our ability to fund current and future expansion as well as future acquisitions and development. These disruptions may include turmoil in the financial services industry, volatility in the markets where our outstanding securities trade, and changes in general economic conditions in the areas where we do business. If we are unable to access funds at competitive rates, or if our short-term or long-term borrowing costs increase, our ability to finance our operations, meet our short-term obligations and implement our operating strategies could be adversely affected.\nIn the future we may be required to raise additional capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business and prospects. Additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to undertake certain activities that we otherwise would find to be desirable. Further, debt service obligations associated with any debt financing could reduce our profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.\nWe may not be able to settle conversions of our convertible senior notes in cash or repurchase the notes in accordance with their terms.\nHolders of our outstanding convertible senior notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the notes) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, upon conversion of the notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversions (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of surrendered notes, or pay cash with respect to notes being converted.\nIn addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the governing indenture, or to pay any cash upon conversion of the notes as required would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself also could lead to a default under agreements governing our credit facility and any of our future indebtedness. If the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes.\nWe may fail to accurately estimate the size and growth of our markets and our customers\u2019 demands.\nWe make significant decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements. We use our estimates to determine the levels of business we seek and accept, production schedules, personnel needs and other resource requirements.\nCustomers may require rapid increases in production on short notice. We may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. Rapid customer ramp-up and significant increases in demand may strain our resources or negatively affect our margins. Inability to satisfy customer demand in a timely manner may harm our reputation, reduce our other opportunities, damage our relationships with customers, reduce revenue growth, and/or incur contractual penalties.\nAlternatively, downturns in the industries in which we compete may cause our customers to significantly reduce their demand. With respect to orders we initiate with our suppliers to address anticipated demand from our customers, certain suppliers may have required non-cancelable purchase commitments or advance payments from us, and those obligations and commitments could reduce our ability to adjust our inventory or expense levels to reflect declining market demands. Unexpected declines in customer demands can result in excess or obsolete inventory and additional charges. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand likely would decrease our gross margins and operating income.\nWe may encounter increased competition.\nWe may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market, including established companies with significant resources. Some of our competitors may have financial, technical, marketing or other capabilities that are more extensive than ours. They may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures. We may not be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThere are limitations on the protection of our intellectual property and we may from time to time be involved in costly intellectual property litigation or indemnification.\nWe rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, combined with employee confidentiality, noncompetition and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future.\nAsserting our intellectual property rights or defending against third-party claims could involve substantial expense. In the event a third-party were successful in a claim that one of our processes infringed its proprietary rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or royalties, or spend substantial amounts in order to obtain a license or modify processes so that they no longer infringe such proprietary rights. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nA significant portion of our business is dependent on cyclical industries.\nOur business is dependent on the demand for products produced by end-users of industrial lasers, optical communication products, components for semiconductor capital equipment, and components for 3D sensing. Many of these end-users are in industries that have historically experienced a highly cyclical demand for their products. As a result, demand for our products is subject to these cyclical fluctuations. Fluctuations in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur global operations are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements.\nWe manufacture products in the United States, China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, and through a contract manufacturer in Thailand. We also maintain direct sales offices in Hong Kong, Japan, Germany, China, Switzerland, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Italy, South Korea and Taiwan. Operations inside and outside of the United States are subject to many legal and regulatory requirements, some of which are not aligned with others. These include tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers, restrictions on the export or import of technology, potentially limited intellectual property protection, import and export requirements and restrictions, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, foreign investment rules and regulations, data privacy requirements, competition laws, employment and labor laws, pensions and social insurance, and environmental health and safety laws and regulations.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations can be onerous and expensive, and requirements differ among jurisdictions. New laws, changes in existing laws, and abrogation of local regulations by national laws may result in significant uncertainties in how they will be interpreted and enforced. Failure to comply with any of these foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in laws and regulations governing data privacy and data protection could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to many data privacy, data protection, and data breach notification laws, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May of 2018. While we have taken measures to assess the requirements of, and to comply with, the GDPR, as well as new and existing data-related laws and regulations of other jurisdictions, these measures may be challenged, including by authorities that regulate data-related compliance. We could incur significant expense in facilitating and responding to investigations, and if the measures we have taken prove to be inadequate, we could face fines, penalties or damages, and incur reputational harm, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nData breach incidents and breakdown of information and communication technologies could disrupt our operations and impact our financial results.\nIn the course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property (both our own and that of our customers), as well as proprietary business information. We could be subject to service outages or breaches of security systems which may result in disruption, unauthorized access, misappropriation, or corruption of this information. Security breaches of our network or data, including physical or electronic break-ins, vendor service outages, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar breaches can create system disruptions, shutdowns, and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If we are unable to prevent or contain such security or privacy breaches, our operations could be disrupted or we could suffer legal claims, loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage, or regulatory penalties.\nWe have entered into supply agreements which commit us to supply products on specified terms.\nWe have supply agreements with some customers which require us to supply products and to allocate sufficient capacity to make these products. We have also agreed to pricing schedules and methodologies which could result in penalties if we fail to meet development, supply, capacity and quality commitments. Failure to do so may cause us to be unable to generate the amount of revenue or the level of profitability we expect from these arrangements. Our ability to realize a profit under some of these agreements will be subject to the level of customer demand, the cost of maintaining facilities and manufacturing capacity, and supply chain capability.\nIf we fail to fulfill our commitments under these supply agreements, our business, after using all remedies available, financial conditions and results of operations may suffer a material adverse effect.\nWe depend on highly complex manufacturing processes that require feeder materials, components and products from limited sources of supply.\nOur operations are dependent upon a supply chain of difficult-to-make or difficult-to-refine products and materials. Some of our product inflow is subject to yield reductions from growth or fabrication losses, and thus the quantities we may receive are not consistently predictable. Customers may also change the specification for a product that our suppliers cannot meet.\nWe also make products for which the Company is one of the world\u2019s largest suppliers. We use high-quality, optical grade ZnSe in the production of many of our IR optical products. We are a leading producer of zinc selenide (\u201cZnSe\u201d) for our internal use and for external sale. The production of ZnSe is a complex process requiring a highly controlled environment. A number of factors, including defective or contaminated materials, could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of high quality ZnSe. Lack of adequate availability of high quality ZnSe could have a material adverse effect upon our business. There can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yield inefficiencies which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe produce hydrogen selenide gas which is used in our production of ZnSe. There are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material. Our lack of proper handling of hydrogen selenide could require us to curtail our production of hydrogen selenide. Our potential inability to internally produce hydrogen selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, we produce and use other high purity and relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture our products including, but not limited to, zinc sulfide (\u201cZnS\u201d), gallium arsenide (\u201cGaAs\u201d), Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (\u201cYAG\u201d), Yttrium Lithium Fluoride (\u201cYLF\u201d), Calcium Fluoride, Germanium, Selenium, Telluride, Bismuth Telluride (\u201cBi2Te3\u201d) and silicon carbide (\u201cSiC\u201d). A significant failure of our internal production processes or our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of these necessary materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIncreases in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of increases in commodity prices. Our businesses purchase, produce and sell high-purity selenium and other raw materials based upon quoted market prices from minor metal exchanges. The negative impact from increases in commodity prices might not be recovered through our product sales which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and financial condition.\nWe use and generate potentially hazardous substances that are subject to stringent environmental regulations.\nHazardous substances used or generated in some of our research and manufacturing facilities are subject to stringent environmental regulation. We believe that our handling of such substances is in material compliance with applicable local, state and federal environmental, safety and health regulations at each operating location. We invest substantially in proper personal protective equipment, process controls, including monitoring and specialized training to minimize risks to employees, surrounding communities and the environment that could result from the presence and handling of such hazardous substances. When exposure problems or potential exposure problems have been uncovered, corrective actions have been implemented and re-occurrence has been minimal or non-existent.\nWe have in place an emergency response plan with respect to our generation and use of the hazardous substances Hydrogen Selenide, Hydrogen Sulfide, Arsine and Phosphine. Special attention has been given to all procedures pertaining to these gaseous materials to minimize the chances of its accidental release into the atmosphere.\nWith respect to the manufacturing, use, storage and disposal of the low-level radioactive material Thorium Fluoride, our facilities and procedures have been inspected and licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Thorium-bearing by-products are collected and shipped as solid waste to a government-approved low-level radioactive waste disposal site in Clive, Utah.\nThe generation, use, collection, storage and disposal of all other hazardous by-products, such as suspended solids containing heavy metals or airborne particulates, are believed by us to be in material compliance with regulations. We believe that we have obtained all of the permits and licenses required for operation of our business.\nAlthough we do not know of any material environmental, safety or health problems in our properties or processes or products, there can be no assurance that problems will not develop in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nUnfavorable changes in tax rates, tax liabilities or tax accounting rules could negatively affect future results.\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions. As such, we must exercise a level of judgment in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates or changes in tax laws. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate.\nThe enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) in December 2017 significantly affected U.S. tax law by changing how the U.S. imposes tax on multinational corporations. The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority under the Tax Act to issue regulations and interpretive guidance. We have applied available guidance to estimate our tax obligations, but new guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department may cause us to make adjustments to our tax estimates in future periods.\nIn addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provision and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operation or financial condition.\nNatural disasters or other global or regional catastrophic events could disrupt our operations, give rise to substantial environmental hazards and adversely affect our results.\nWe may be exposed to business interruptions due to catastrophe, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorism or acts of war that are beyond our control. Disruptions to our facilities or systems, or to those of our key suppliers, could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. As a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, retain and develop key personnel and requires continued good relations with our employees.\nWe are highly dependent upon the experience and continuing services of certain scientists, engineers, production and management personnel. Competition for the services of these personnel is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract the personnel necessary for our success. The loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur stock price has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future.\nThe market price for our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market varied between a high of $50.75 and a low of $29.31 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. We expect that this volatility will continue. Factors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price include, among other things, general economic and market conditions, actual or anticipated variations in operating results, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts\u2019 estimates or expectations, conditions or trends in the industries in which our products are purchased, announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives, capital commitments, additions or departures of key personnel, sales of our common stock or equity-linked securities and issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with conversions of our outstanding convertible senior notes.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. However, these factors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, in recent years, the stock market in general, and The Nasdaq Stock Market and the securities of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations have in the past, and may in the future, materially and adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results. This volatility may affect the price at which our shareholders can sell our common stock.\nSome anti-takeover provisions contained in our articles of incorporation and by-laws, as well as provisions of Pennsylvania law, could impair a takeover attempt, which could also reduce the market price of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that could make us a less attractive target for a hostile takeover and could make more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, a tender offer or a proxy contest. Such provisions include:\n\u2022\nA requirement that shareholder-nominated director nominees be nominated in advance of the meeting at which directors are elected and that specific information be provided in connection with such nomination;\n\u2022\nThe ability of our board of directors to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock without shareholder approval; and\n\u2022\nCertain provisions requiring supermajority approval (at least two-thirds of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class).\nIn addition, the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (the \u201cBCL\u201d) contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. Many of these provisions are triggered if any person or group acquires, or discloses the intent to acquire, 20% or more of a corporation\u2019s voting power, subject to certain exceptions. These provisions:\n\u2022\nprovide the other shareholders of the corporation with certain rights against the acquiring group or person;\n\u2022\nprohibit the corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with the acquiring group or person;\n\u2022\nrestrict the voting and other rights of the acquiring group or person; and\n\u2022\nprovide that certain profits realized by the acquiring group or person from the sale of our equity securities belong to and are recoverable by us.\nRegardless of the amount of a person\u2019s holdings, if a shareholder or shareholder group (including affiliated persons) would be a party to certain proposed transactions with us or would be treated differently from other shareholders of ours in certain proposed transactions, the BCL requires approval by a majority of votes entitled to be cast by all shareholders other than the interested shareholder or affiliate group, unless the transaction is approved by independent directors or other criteria are satisfied. Furthermore, under the BCL, a \u201cshort-form\u201d merger of II-VI cannot be implemented without the consent of our board of directors.\nIn addition, as permitted by Pennsylvania law, an amendment to our articles of incorporation or other corporate action that is approved by shareholders may provide mandatory special treatment for specified groups of non-consenting shareholders of the same class. For example, an amendment to our articles of incorporation or other corporate action may provide that shares of common stock held by designated shareholders of record must be cashed out at a price determined by the corporation, subject to applicable dissenters\u2019 rights.\nFurthermore, the BCL provides that directors may, in discharging their duties, consider, to the extent they deem appropriate, the effects of any action upon shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers and the communities in which its offices are located. Directors are not required to consider the interests of shareholders to a greater degree than other constituencies\u2019 interests. The BCL expressly provides that directors do not violate their fiduciary duties solely by relying on \u201cpoison pills\u201d or the anti-takeover provisions of the BCL. We do not currently have a \u201cpoison pill.\u201d\nAll of these provisions may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.\nBecause we do not currently intend to pay dividends, holders of our common stock will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value, and by the intended anti-dilution actions of our share-buyback program.\nWe have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock, and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the development of our business. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will maintain its value or appreciate in value.\nWe contract with a number of large end-user service providers and product companies that have considerable bargaining power, which may require us to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues.\nLarge end-user service providers and product companies comprise a significant portion of our customer base. These customers generally have greater purchasing power than smaller entities and, accordingly, often request and receive more favorable terms from suppliers, including us. As we seek to expand our sales to existing customers and acquire new customers, we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that are favorable to our customers and that may affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue, increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, large customers have increased buying power and ability to require onerous terms in our contracts with them, including pricing, warranties, and indemnification terms. If we are unable to satisfy the terms of these contracts, it could result in liabilities of a material nature, including litigation, damages, additional costs, loss of market share and loss of reputation. Additionally, the terms these large customers require, such as most-favored customer or exclusivity provisions, may impact our ability to do business with other customers and generate revenues from such customers.\nWe may be adversely affected by climate change regulations.\nIn many of the countries in which we operate, government bodies are increasingly enacting legislation and regulations in response to potential impacts of climate change. These laws and regulations may be mandatory. They have the potential to impact our operations directly or indirectly as a result of required compliance by our customers or our supply chain. Inconsistency of regulations may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which we operate.\nWe may incur increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations, added costs to purchase or lower profits from sales of our products, allowances or credits under a \u201ccap and trade\u201d system, increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage, a change in competitive position relative to industry peers, and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by us and indirectly, from changes in costs of goods sold.\nWe depend on large purchases from a few significant customers, and any loss, cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business.\nA small number of customers have consistently accounted for a significant portion of our revenues, although none individually greater than 10% of total revenues. Our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with our major customers. Although we are attempting to expand our customer base, we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future. We may not be able to offset any decline in revenues from our existing major customers with revenues from new customers, and our quarterly results may be volatile because we are dependent on large orders from these customers that may be reduced, delayed, or cancelled. The markets in which we have historically sold our optical subsystems and components products are dominated by a relatively small number of systems manufacturers, thereby limiting the number of our potential customers.\nOur dependence on large orders from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each customer critically important to our business. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain our major customers, attract additional customers, or that our customers will be successful in selling their products that incorporate our products. We have in the past experienced delays and reductions in orders from some of our major customers. In addition, our customers have in the past sought price concessions from us, and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future. Expense reduction measures that we have implemented over the past several years, and additional action we are taking to reduce costs, may adversely affect our ability to introduce new and improved products which may, in turn, adversely affect our relationships with some of our key customers. Further, some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products from us to our competitors or to joint ventures between these customers and our competitors, or may in certain circumstances produce competitive products themselves. The loss of one or more of our major customers, any reduction or delay in sales to these customers, our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers, or future price concessions that we may make could significantly harm our business.\nThe manufacturing of our products may be adversely affected if we are unable to manufacture certain products in our manufacturing facilities.\nWe manufacture some of the components that we provide to our contract manufacturer, along with our own finished goods. For some of the components and finished goods we are the sole manufacturer. Our manufacturing processes are highly complex, and issues are often difficult to detect and correct. From time to time we have experienced problems achieving acceptable yields in our manufacturing facilities, resulting in delays in the availability of our products. In addition, if we experience problems with our manufacturing facilities, it would be costly and require a long period of time to move the manufacture of these components and finished good products to a different facility or contract manufacturer, which could result in interruptions in supply, and would likely materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, for a variety of reasons, including changes in circumstances at our contract manufacturers or our own business strategies, we may be required to, or voluntarily may, transfer the manufacturing of certain products to other manufacturing sites.\nChanges in manufacturing processes are often required due to changes in product specifications, changing customer needs and the introduction of new products. These changes may reduce manufacturing yields at our contract manufacturers and at our own manufacturing facilities, resulting in reduced margins on those products. In addition, many of our products are sourced from suppliers based outside of the United States, primarily in Asia. Uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries has recently increased. Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the imposition of tariffs on imported products, could increase our product and product-related costs or require us to seek alternative suppliers, either of which could result in decreased sales or increases product and product-related costs.\nFailure to accurately forecast our revenues could result in additional charges for obsolete or excess inventories or non-cancelable purchase commitments.\nWe base many of our operating decisions, and enter into purchase commitments, on the basis of anticipated revenue trends which are highly unpredictable. Some of our purchase commitments are not cancelable, and in some cases we are required to recognize a charge representing the amount of material or capital equipment purchased or ordered, which exceeds our actual requirements. Should revenues in future periods fall substantially below our expectations, or should we fail to accurately forecast changes in demand mix, we could be required to record substantial charges for obsolete or excess inventories or non-cancelable purchase commitments\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and Nasdaq listing requirements. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.\nAny failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could cause us to delay reporting of our financial results, be subject to one or more investigations or enforcement actions by state or federal regulatory agencies, stockholder lawsuits or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs, pay fines, settlements or judgments. Any such failures could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq stock market.\nRisks Relating to the Merger\nAlthough II-VI expects that its acquisition of Finisar will result in cost savings, synergies and other benefits, the combined company may not realize those benefits because of integration difficulties and other challenges.\nThe success of II-VI\u2019s acquisition of Finisar will depend in large part on the success of the management of the combined company in integrating the operations, strategies, technologies and personnel of the two companies following the completion of the Merger. The combined company may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected. The failure of the combined company to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the operations of the two companies or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the Merger, including additional cost savings and synergies, could impair the operations of the combined company. In addition, II-VI anticipates that the overall integration of Finisar will be a time-consuming and expensive process that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt the combined company\u2019s business.\nPotential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nthe integration of management teams, strategies, technologies and operations, products and services;\n\u2022\nthe disruption of ongoing businesses and distraction of their respective management teams from ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022\nthe retention of and possible decrease in business from the existing customers of both companies;\n\u2022\nthe creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;\n\u2022\nthe reduction of the costs associated with each company\u2019s operations;\n\u2022\nthe integration of corporate cultures and maintenance of employee morale;\n\u2022\nthe retention of key employees; and\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities associated with the Merger.\nThe anticipated cost savings, synergies and other benefits of the Merger assume a successful integration of the companies and are based on projections and other assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. Even if integration is successful, anticipated cost savings, synergies and other benefits may not be achieved.\nII-VI and Finisar will incur significant transaction-related costs in connection with the Merger.\nII-VI and Finisar expect to incur a number of non-recurring transaction-related costs associated with completing the Merger, combining the operations of the two companies and achieving desired synergies. These fees and costs will be significant. Non-recurring transaction costs include, but are not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial and accounting advisors, filing fees and printing costs. II-VI will incur significant costs with respect to the financing for the cash consideration to be paid in connection with the Merger. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of II-VI and Finisar. There can be no assurance that the elimination of certain duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses, will offset the incremental transaction-related costs over time. Thus, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, the long term or at all.\nOur pending acquisition of Finisar is subject to conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied, and may not be completed on a timely basis, or at all. Failure to complete the Merger could have material and adverse effects on us.\nThe completion of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, which make the completion and timing of the completion of the Merger uncertain. Also, either Finisar or II-VI may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger has not been completed by November 8, 2019, although this termination right is not available if failure to comply with the Merger Agreement is a principal cause of or results in the failure of the Merger to occur before November 8, 2019.\nIf the Merger is not completed on a timely basis, or at all, II-VI\u2019s and Finisar\u2019s respective ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, II-VI and Finisar will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nII-VI and Finisar will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees;\n\u2022\nunder the Merger Agreement, each of II-VI and Finisar is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing the Merger, which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies;\n\u2022\ntime and resources committed by II-VI\u2019s and Finisar\u2019s respective management to matters relating to the Merger could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of II-VI Common Stock could decline below current market prices to the extent that such current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed.\nIn addition, if the Merger is not completed, II-VI may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from its customers and employees. II-VI could also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or to enforcement proceedings commenced against II-VI to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement. If the Merger is not completed, II-VI cannot assure its shareholders that the risks described above will not materialize and will not adversely affect the business, financial results and stock prices of II-VI.\nEach of II-VI and Finisar is subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending, which could adversely affect each of Finisar\u2019s and II-VI\u2019s business and operations.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, Finisar and II-VI are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of their respective business prior to completing the Merger, which may adversely affect each party\u2019s ability to execute certain of its business strategies. Such limitations could negatively affect each party\u2019s businesses and operations prior to the completion of the Merger. Furthermore, the process of planning to integrate two businesses and organizations for the post-Merger period can divert management attention and resources and could ultimately have an adverse effect on each of Finisar and II-VI.\nIn connection with the Merger, parties with which Finisar or II-VI does business may experience uncertainty associated with the Merger, including with respect to current or future business relationships with Finisar, II-VI or the combined business. It is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom Finisar or II-VI has a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with Finisar or II-VI, as applicable, as a result of the Merger, which could negatively affect Finisar\u2019s or II-VI\u2019s revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of shares of II-VI Common Stock, regardless of whether the Merger is completed.\nThe market price of II-VI Common Stock may decline in the future as a result of the Merger.\nThe market price of II-VI Common Stock may decline in the future as a result of the Merger for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nthe unsuccessful integration of Finisar and II-VI (including for the reasons set forth in the preceding risk factor);\n\u2022\nthe need to pay cash amounts owing on conversion of, or in respect of any demands for repurchase of, Finisar\u2019s outstanding convertible notes in connection with the Merger and to issue II-VI Common Stock in connection with any future conversion of the Finisar\u2019s outstanding convertible notes, which may cause substantial dilution to holders of II-VI Common Stock; and\n\u2022\nthe failure of the combined company to achieve the perceived benefits of the Merger, including financial results, as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts.\nThese factors are, to some extent, beyond the control of II-VI. As a consequence, II-VI shareholders could lose the value of their investment in II-VI Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 11752, "SIC": 3827, "TIC": "IIVI"}
