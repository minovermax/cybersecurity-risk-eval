{"cik": "746210", "company": "Oblong, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-05-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business faces numerous risks, including those set forth below and those described elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks that we face, nor are they necessarily listed in order of significance. Other risks and uncertainties may also affect our business. Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. When making an investment decision with respect to our common stock, you should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have experienced declines in revenue in recent fiscal years and may continue to experience further revenue decline in future periods.\nBoth Glowpoint and Oblong Industries have experienced declines in revenue for the last several years. We believe that these revenue declines are primarily due to net attrition of customers and lower demand for our services given the competitive environment and pressure on pricing that exists in our industry. During the past several years, Glowpoint had limited resources to invest in product development and sales and marketing in order to reverse the Company\u2019s revenue trends. With the acquisition of Oblong Industries, our goal is to grow revenue from an increase in adoption of Oblong Industries\u2019 product offerings. If we cannot successfully gain adoption of our Mezzanine product offering in the Cisco partner channel or through other channels, we may not be able to grow revenue and/or increase the market share of our products. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available to invest in sales and marketing and continued product development in order to achieve revenue growth.\nWe have a history of substantial net operating losses and we may incur future net losses.\nBoth Glowpoint and Oblong Industries reported substantial net losses in recent years. We may not be able to achieve revenue growth or profitability or generate positive cash flow on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. If we do not achieve profitability in the future, the value of our common stock may be adversely impacted, and we could have difficulty obtaining capital to continue our operations.\nOur business activities may require additional financing that might not be obtainable on acceptable terms, if at all, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity and its ability to operate as a going concern in the future.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2019, we had $4.6 million of cash, an accumulated consolidated deficit of $185.4 million resulting from historical net losses, and $5.6 million of total obligations under the Silicon Valley Bank (\u201cSVB\u201d) Loan Agreement. In addition, the former Glowpoint business has experienced declines in revenue in recent fiscal years, with revenue of $14.8 million, $12.6 million and $9.7 million in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nThe SVB Loan Agreement provides that interest-only payments were due through March 31, 2020, after which equal monthly principal and interest payments will be payable in order to fully repay the loan by September 1, 2021 (the \u201cMaturity Date\u201d). Prior to April 1, 2020, SVB (i) indicated its agreement via e-mail to defer the monthly principal payment of $291,500 and a prior deferral fee of $100,000 that were each due on April 1, 2020 and (ii) verbally agreed to defer the monthly principal payment of $291,500 that was due on May 1, 2020, in each case to June 1, 2020. Failure to make these payments will constitute an event of default under the SVB Loan Agreement. However, the Company and SVB are currently in negotiations to restructure the SVB Loan Agreement, though there can be no assurance that the Company and SVB will be able to reach any agreement. In April 2020, we received cash proceeds from a loan for $2,416,600 (the \u201cPPP Loan\u201d) from MidFirst Bank under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) contained within the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The PPP Loan has a term of two years, is unsecured, and is guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). The PPP Loan carries a fixed interest rate of one percent (1.0%) per annum, with the first six months of interest deferred. Our capital requirements in the future will continue to depend on numerous factors, including the timing and amount of revenue for the combined organization, customer renewal rates and the timing of collection of outstanding accounts receivable, in each case particularly as it relates to the combined organization\u2019s major customers, the expense to deliver services, expense for sales and marketing, expense for research and development, capital expenditures, the cost involved in protecting intellectual property rights, debt service obligations under the SVB Loan Agreement, the amount of forgiveness of the PPP Loan, if any, and the debt service obligations under the PPP Loan, and expenses required to successfully integrate Glowpoint and Oblong Industries. While our acquisition of Oblong does provide additional revenues to the Company, the cost to further develop and commercialize Oblong\u2019s product offerings is expected to exceed its revenues for the foreseeable future. We expect to achieve certain revenue and cost synergies in connection with combining Glowpoint and Oblong Industries and also expect to reduce the Company\u2019s operating expenses in the future as compared to our annualized operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2019. We also expect to continue to invest in product development and sales and marketing expenses with the goal of growing the Company\u2019s revenue in the future. The Company believes that, based on the combined organization\u2019s current projection of revenue, expenses, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, and cash flows, it will not have sufficient resources to fund its operations for the next twelve months following the filing of this Report. We believe additional capital will be required to fund operations and provide growth capital including investments in technology, product development and sales and marketing. To access capital to fund operations or provide growth capital, we will need to restructure the SVB Loan Agreement and raise capital in one or more debt and/or equity offerings. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising necessary capital or that any such offering will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed on terms acceptable to us, it could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company. The factors discussed above raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties.\nThe SVB Loan Agreement contains restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nAs discussed herein, as of December 31, 2019 and as of the filing of this Report we had $5.6 million of total obligations outstanding under the SVB Loan Agreement. Our obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets, including accounts receivable, intellectual property, equipment and other personal property. The Loan Agreement contains certain restrictions and covenants, which, among other things, subject to certain exceptions, restrict our ability to dispose of any portion of our business or property, engage in certain material changes to our business, enter into a merger, incur additional debt or make guarantees, make distributions or create liens or other encumbrances, or enter into related party transactions outside of the ordinary course of business. There is no assurance that SVB will provide a waiver to permit any of these actions even if such actions are in the best interests of our stockholders.\nThe Loan Agreement also contains customary events of default, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, failure to perform or observe covenants, breaches of representations and warranties, certain cross defaults, certain bankruptcy related events, monetary judgment defaults and a de-listing of the Company from the NYSE American without a listing of its Common Stock on another nationally recognized stock exchange. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations may be accelerated and become immediately due and payable.\nWe may be unable to repay the outstanding principal and accrued interest under the SVB Loan Agreement, in which event SVB could exercise its default remedies under the Loan Agreement.\nOur obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets, including accounts receivable, intellectual property, equipment and other personal property. The Loan Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants and also includes customary events of default, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, failure to perform or observe covenants, breaches of representations and warranties, certain cross defaults, certain bankruptcy related events, monetary judgments defaults and a de-listing of the Company from the NYSE American without a listing of its Common Stock on another nationally recognized stock exchange. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 5.00% per annum may be applied to the outstanding loan balance, and SVB may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and exercise all of its rights and remedies as set forth in the Loan Agreement and under applicable law. Among other things, the Lenders could attempt to take possession of and sell substantially all of our assets, which would have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to repay all outstanding principal and accrued interest under the Loan Agreement. In order to attempt to prevent the occurrence of an event of default under the Loan Agreement, we might be required to take actions that might not be in our long-term best interests such as (1) dedicating a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and accrued interest under the Loan Agreement, thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes, (2) divesting valuable assets in order to raise funds with which to repay the principal and accrued interest under the Loan Agreement, and (3) delaying capital expenditures, new product candidate initiatives and acquisitions of other businesses. The existence of the Loan Agreement and the obligations under the Loan Agreement might also limit our ability to obtain additional equity or debt funding from third parties.\nWe received a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act, and all or a portion of the loan may not be forgivable.\nIn April 2020, we received a loan for $2,416,600 from MidFirst Bank under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) contained within the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The PPP loan has a term of two years, is unsecured, and is guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). The loan carries a fixed interest rate of one percent (1.0%) per annum, with the first six months of interest deferred. Under the CARES Act, we will be eligible to apply for forgiveness of certain loan proceeds used to pay payroll costs, rent, utilities and other qualifying expenses during the eight-week period following receipt of the loan, provided that we maintain our number of employees and compensation within certain parameters during such period. If the conditions outlined in the PPP loan program are adhered to by us, all or part of such loan could be forgiven. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be eligible for loan forgiveness or that any amount of the PPP loan will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA. Any forgiven amounts will not be included in our taxable income.\nIf we fail to achieve broad market acceptance on a timely basis, we will not be able to compete effectively, and we will likely experience continued declines in revenue and lower gross margins.\nWe operate in a highly competitive, quickly changing environment, and our future success depends on our ability to develop or acquire, and introduce, new products that achieve broad market acceptance. Our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to identify demand trends in the markets in which we operate, and to quickly develop or acquire, and build and sell products that satisfy these demands in a cost-effective manner. In order to differentiate our products from our competitors\u2019 products, we must increase our focus and capital investment in research and development. If our products do not achieve widespread market acceptance, or if we are unsuccessful in capitalizing on market opportunities, our future growth may be slowed and our financial results could be harmed. Also, as the mix of our business increasingly includes new products and services that require additional investment, this shift may adversely impact our margins, at least in the near-term. Successfully predicting demand trends is difficult, and it is very difficult to predict the effect that introducing a new product will have on existing product sales. We will also need to respond effectively to new product announcements by our competitors by quickly introducing competitive products.\nIn addition, we may not be able to successfully manage integration of any new product lines with our existing products. Selling new product lines in new markets will require our management to learn different strategies in order to be successful. We may be unsuccessful in launching a new product line in new markets which requires management of new suppliers, potential new customers and new business models. Our management may not have the experience of selling in these new markets and we may not be able to grow our business as planned. If we are unable to effectively and successfully further develop these new product lines, we may not be able to achieve our desired sales targets and our gross margins may be adversely affected.\nWe may experience delays and quality issues in releasing new products, which could result in lower quarterly revenue than expected. In addition, we may experience product introductions that fall short of our projected rates of market adoption. Any future delays in product development and introduction, or product introductions that do not meet broad market acceptance, or unsuccessful launches of new product lines could result in:\n\u2022\nloss of or delay in revenue and loss of market share;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity and damage to our reputation and brand;\n\u2022\na decline in the average selling price of our products; and\n\u2022\nadverse reactions in our sales channels.\nIf we cannot successfully introduce new product lines, either through rapid innovation or acquisition of new products or product lines, we may not be able to maintain or increase the market share of our products. In addition, if we are unable to successfully introduce or acquire new products with higher gross margins, or if we are unable to improve the margins on our existing product lines, our revenue and overall gross margin will likely decline.\nWe cannot assure you that our present or future products will achieve market acceptance on a sustained basis. In order to achieve market acceptance and achieve future revenue growth, we must introduce new product lines, incorporate new technologies into our existing product lines and design, and develop and successfully commercialize higher performance products in a timely manner. We cannot assure you that it will be able to offer new or complementary products that gain market acceptance quickly enough to avoid decreased revenues during current or future product introductions or transitions.\nWe depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customer\u2019s changing needs, our operating result may suffer.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, and new product and service introductions. Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products. If customers do not purchase and/or renew our offerings our business could be harmed. The process of developing new technology related to market transitions - such as collaboration, digital transformation and cloud - is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers\u2019 changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed. We must commit significant resources, including the investments we have been making in our strategic priorities to developing new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market will accept. In particular, if our modeled evolution from on-premises products to hybrid and, ultimately, SaaS consumption of our flagship Mezzanine\u2122 products does not emerge as we believe it will, or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will, or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful, many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value. Similarly, our business could be harmed if we fail to develop, or fail to develop in a timely fashion, offerings to address other market transitions, or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, different\nfrom ours. In addition, our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to qualify or otherwise evaluate new product offerings.\nWe have also been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services generally consumed in conventional commercial conference rooms to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions, and we are seeking to meet the evolving needs of customers which include offering our products and solutions in the manner in which customers wish to consume them. As a part of this transformation, we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology, including changes in our business models with customers. If our strategy for addressing our customer needs, or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs, or the changes we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective, we may not be able to achieve our customer adoption and revenue goals, in connection with which our operating results and financial condition may be negatively affected.\nFurthermore, we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources. This could result in competitors, some of which may also be our partners, providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share, revenue, and earnings. In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market. The success of new products and services depends on several factors, including proper new product and service definition, component costs, timely completion and introduction of these products and services, differentiation of new products and services from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products and services. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and services opportunities, develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products and services or that products, services and technologies developed by others will not render our products, services or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.\nHolders of our Series C Preferred Stock and other preferred securities have certain consent rights that could limit us from taking certain corporate actions, and as a result may adversely affect our business, operating results and stock price.\nHolders of our 0% Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries C Preferred Stock\u201d) have certain consent rights with respect to its ability to take certain corporate actions, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe issuance, authorization or creation of any class or series of capital stock senior to or on parity with the Series C Preferred Stock, or any class or series of capital stock junior to the Series C Preferred Stock but with a maturity, redemption or repayment date prior to the date on which any Series C Preferred Stock remains outstanding; and\n\u2022\nthe entry by the Company into certain \u201cfundamental transactions,\u201d including transactions constituting a change of control of the Company, certain reorganization transactions or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition to the foregoing consent rights, holders of our Series C Preferred Stock have the right to participate, pro-rata on the post-conversion basis of its preferred stock, in (i) any purchase rights issued by us pro-rata to the holders of any class of our common stock and (ii) the distribution of securities or other assets made by us to the holders of common stock pursuant to certain fundamental corporate transactions.\nExcept as required by law or our Certificate of Incorporation, holders of our Series C Preferred Stock have the same voting rights as holders of common stock, voting together as one class on an as-converted basis as if converted at a conversion price of $3.33 per share (note that this conversion price for voting purposes is different than the actual conversion price of $3.00 per share).\nHolders of our Series A-2, Series D and Series E Preferred Stock are provided with certain standard consent and voting rights under the Certificates of Designations governing such securities.\nThe foregoing consent and other rights of the holders of our Preferred Stock could, while such securities are outstanding, limit us from obtaining future financings to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities, and as a result may adversely affect our business, operating results and stock price.\nOur success is highly dependent on the evolution of our overall market and on general economic conditions.\nThe market for collaboration technology and services is evolving rapidly. Although certain industry analysts project significant growth for this market, their projections may not be realized. Our future growth depends on broad acceptance and adoption of collaboration technologies and services. There can be no assurance that this market will grow, that our offerings will be adopted or that businesses will purchase our collaboration technologies and services. If we are unable to react quickly to changes\nin the market, if the market fails to develop or develops more slowly than expected, or if our services do not achieve market acceptance, then we are unlikely to achieve profitability. Additionally, adverse economic conditions may cause a decline in business and consumer spending which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nWe may be unable to adequately respond to rapid changes in technology.\nThe market for our collaboration technologies and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions. The introduction of products and services embodying new technology and the emergence of new industry standards may render our existing product and service offerings obsolete and unmarketable if we are unable to adapt to change. A significant factor in our ability to grow and to remain competitive is our ability to successfully introduce new products and services that embody new technology, anticipate and incorporate evolving industry standards and achieve levels of functionality and price acceptable to the market. If our offerings are unable to meet expectations or unable to keep pace with technological changes in the collaboration industry, our offerings could eventually become obsolete. We may be unable to allocate the funds necessary to upgrade our offerings as improvements in collaboration technologies are introduced. In the event that other companies develop more advanced service offerings, our competitive position relative to such companies would be harmed.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and many of our competitors have greater financial resources and established relationships with major corporate customers.\nThe collaboration industry is highly competitive and includes large, well-financed participants. Many of these organizations have substantially greater financial and other resources than us, furnish some of the same services provided by us, and have established relationships with major corporate customers that have policies of purchasing directly from them. Our competitors offer services similar both on a bundled and un-bundled basis, creating a highly competitive environment with pressure on pricing of such services. We believe that as the demand for collaboration technologies continues to increase, additional competitors, many of which may have greater resources than us, will continue to enter this market.\nWe rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of any one of those customers, or several of our smaller customers, could materially harm our business.\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2019, two major customers accounted for 20% and 18%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s total consolidated revenue. The composition of our significant customers will vary from period to period and we expect that most of our revenue will continue, for the foreseeable future, to come from a relatively small number of customers. Consequently, our financial results may fluctuate significantly from period-to-period based on the actions of one or more significant customers. A customer may take actions that affect the Company for reasons that we cannot anticipate or control, such as reasons related to the customer\u2019s financial condition, changes in the customer\u2019s business strategy or operations, changes in technology and the introduction of alternative competing products, or as the result of the perceived quality or cost-effectiveness of our products. Our agreements with these customers may be canceled if we materially breach the agreement or for other reasons outside of our control such as insolvency or financial hardship that may result in a customer filing for bankruptcy court protection against unsecured creditors. In addition, our customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of current agreements or renewals. The loss of or a reduction in sales or anticipated sales to our most significant or several of our smaller customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny system failures or interruptions may cause loss of customers.\nOur success depends, in part, on the seamless, uninterrupted operation of our managed service offerings. As the complexity and volume continue to increase, we will face increasing demands and challenges in managing them. Any prolonged failure of these services or other systems or hardware that cause significant interruptions to our operations could seriously damage our reputation and result in customer attrition and financial loss.\nThere is limited market awareness of our services.\nOur future success will be dependent in significant part on our ability to generate demand for our collaboration technologies and services. To this end, our direct marketing and indirect sales operations must increase market awareness of our service offerings to generate increased revenue. We have limited sales and marketing resources, with 20 employees in sales and marketing as of December 31, 2019, and we have had limited resources and/or cash flow in the last several years for spending on advertising, marketing and additional personnel. Our products and services require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at the senior management of our prospective customers. If we were to hire new employees in sales and marketing, those employees will require training and take time to achieve full productivity. We cannot be certain that our new hires will become as productive as necessary or that we\nwill be able to hire enough qualified individuals or retain existing employees in the future. In June 2019, Oblong Industries entered into a sales channel partner agreement with Cisco Systems Inc. As a result, the family of Mezzanine\u2122 product offerings became available globally on the Cisco Global Price List as a part of the Cisco SolutionsPlus Program. This program allows Cisco\u2019s customers and channel partners to purchase Mezzanine\u2122 through Cisco\u2019s Global Price List to streamline the ordering process. Given the limited history with sales through this channel, there can be no assurance that we will generate significant sales through the Cisco channel program. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in our efforts to market and sell our products and services, and, if we are not successful in building market awareness and generating increased sales, future results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party software that may be difficult to replace or may not perform adequately.\nWe integrate third-party licensed software components into our technology infrastructure (e.g., ServiceNow, Inc.) in order to provide our services. This software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or pricing or may fail to continue to be updated to remain competitive. The loss of the right to use this third-party software may increase our expenses or impact the provisioning of our services. The failure of this third-party software could materially impact the performance of our services and may cause material harm to our business or results of operations.\nWe depend upon our network providers and facilities infrastructure.\nOur success depends upon our ability to implement, expand and adapt our network infrastructure and support services to accommodate an increasing amount of video traffic and evolving customer requirements at an acceptable cost. This has required and will continue to require that we enter into agreements with providers of infrastructure capacity, equipment, facilities and support services on an ongoing basis. We cannot ensure that any of these agreements can be obtained on satisfactory terms and conditions. We also anticipate that future expansions and adaptations of our network infrastructure facilities may be necessary in order to respond to growth in the number of customers served.\nOur network could fail, which could negatively impact our revenues.\nOur success depends upon our ability to deliver reliable, high-speed access to our channels\u2019 and customers\u2019 data centers and upon the ability and willingness of our telecommunications providers to deliver reliable, high-speed telecommunications service through their networks. Our network and facilities, and other networks and facilities providing services to us, are vulnerable to damage, unauthorized access or cessation of operations from human error and tampering, breaches of security, fires, earthquakes, severe storms, power losses, telecommunications failures, software defects, intentional acts of vandalism including computer viruses, and similar events. The occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at the network operations center, key sites at which we locate routers, switches and other computer equipment that make up the backbone of our service offering and hosted infrastructure, or at one or more of our partners\u2019 data centers, could substantially and adversely impact our business. We cannot ensure that we will not experience failures or shutdowns relating to individual facilities or even catastrophic failure of the entire network or hosted infrastructure. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems or service providers could result in reductions in, or terminations of, services supplied to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur network depends upon telecommunications carriers who could limit or deny us access to their network or fail to perform, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely upon the ability and willingness of certain telecommunications carriers and other corporations to provide us with reliable high-speed telecommunications service through their networks. If these telecommunications carriers and other corporations decide not to continue to provide service to us through their networks on substantially the same terms and conditions (including, without limitation, price, early termination liability, and installation interval), if at all, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, many of our service level objectives are dependent upon satisfactory performance by our telecommunications carriers. If they fail to so perform, it may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of providing video communications services, we transmit sensitive and proprietary information of our customers. We are dependent on the proper function, availability and security of our information systems, including without limitation those systems utilized in our operations. We have undertaken measures to protect the safety and security of our information systems and the data maintained within those systems, and on an annual basis, we test the adequacy of our security measures. As\npart of our efforts, we may be required to expend significant capital to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches, including unauthorized access to proprietary customer data stored in our information systems and the introduction of computer malware to our systems. However, there can be no assurance our safety and security measures will detect and prevent security breaches in a timely manner or otherwise prevent damage or interruption of our systems and operations. We may be vulnerable to losses associated with the improper functioning, security breach or unavailability of our information systems. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, our affiliates and customers may seek to hold us liable for any damages, which could result in reputational damage, litigation, or negative publicity, among other negative consequences.\nWe may experience material disconnections and/or reductions in the prices of our services and may not be able to replace the loss of revenues.\nHistorically, we have experienced both significant disconnections of services and also reductions in the prices of our services. We endeavor to obtain long-term commitments from new customers, as well as expand our relationships with current customers. The disconnection of services by our significant customers or by several of our smaller customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Service contract durations and termination liabilities are defined within the terms and conditions of the Company\u2019s agreements with our customers. Termination of services in our existing agreements typically require a minimum of 30 days\u2019 notice and are subject to early termination penalties equal to the amount of accrued and unpaid charges including the remaining term length multiplied by any fixed monthly fees. The standard form of service agreement with us includes an auto-renewal clause at the end of each term if the customer does not choose to terminate service at that time. Certain customers and partners negotiate master agreements with custom termination liabilities that differ from our standard form of service agreement.\nOur failure to obtain or maintain the right to use certain intellectual property may negatively affect our business.\nOur future success and competitive position depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain certain proprietary intellectual property to be used in connection with our services. While we are not currently engaged in any intellectual property litigation, we could become subject to lawsuits in which it is alleged that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or we could commence lawsuits against others who we believe are infringing upon our rights. Our involvement in intellectual property litigation could result in significant expense, adversely affecting the development of sales of the challenged product and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor.\nIn the event of an adverse outcome as a defendant in any such litigation, we may, among other things, be required to pay substantial damages; cease the development, use or sale of services that infringe upon other patented intellectual property; expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing intellectual property; discontinue the use or incorporation of infringing technology; or obtain licenses to the infringing intellectual property. We cannot ensure that we would be successful in such development or acquisition or that such licenses would be available upon reasonable terms. Any such development, acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources and could have a negative effect on our business and financial results.\nAn adverse outcome as plaintiff in any such litigation, in addition to the costs involved, may, among other things, result in the loss of the intellectual property (such as a patent) that was the subject of the lawsuit by a determination of invalidity or unenforceability, significantly increase competition as a result of such determination, and require the payment of penalties resulting from counterclaims by the defendant.\nWe may not be able to protect the rights to its intellectual property.\nFailure to protect our existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of our exclusivity or the right to use our technologies. If we do not adequately ensure our freedom to use certain technology, we may have to pay others for rights to use their intellectual property, pay damages for infringement or misappropriation and/or be enjoined from using such intellectual property. We rely on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property. Some of our intellectual property is not covered by any patent. As we further develop our services and related intellectual property, we expect to seek additional patent protection. Our patent position is subject to complex factual and legal issues that may give rise to uncertainty as to the validity, scope and enforceability of a particular patent. Accordingly, we cannot assure that any of the patents owned by us or other patents that other parties license to us in the future will not be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, rendered unenforceable or licensed to others; any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the breadth of claim coverage sought by it, if issued at all; or any patents owned by or licensed to us, although valid, will not be dominated by a patent or patents to others having broader claims. Additionally, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in certain foreign countries.\nWe also seek to protect our proprietary intellectual property, including intellectual property that may not be patented or patentable, in part by confidentiality agreements. We cannot ensure that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that such persons will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of these relationships.\nWe are exposed to the credit and other counterparty risk of our customers in the ordinary course of our business.\nOur customers have varying degrees of creditworthiness, and we may not always be able to fully anticipate or detect deterioration in their creditworthiness and overall financial condition, which could expose us to an increased risk of nonpayment under our contracts with them. In the event that a material customer or customers default on their payment obligations to us, discontinue buying services from us or use their buying power with us to reduce its revenue, this could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur future plans could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract or retain key personnel.\nWe have attracted a highly skilled management team and specialized workforce. Our future success is dependent in part on attracting and retaining qualified management and technical personnel. Our inability to hire qualified personnel on a timely basis, or the departure of key employees (including Peter Holst, Oblong\u2019s President and CEO) without a suitable replacement therefor could materially and adversely affect our business development and therefore, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our actual liability for sales and use taxes and federal regulatory fees is different from our accrued liability, it could have a material impact on our financial condition.\nEach state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. We review these rules and regulations periodically and, when we believe our services are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state, voluntarily engages state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with their rules and regulations. Vendors of services, like us, are typically held responsible by taxing authorities for the collection and payment of any applicable sales taxes and federal fees. If one or more taxing authorities determines that taxes should have, but have not, been paid with respect to our services, we may be liable for past taxes in addition to taxes going forward. Liability for past taxes may also include very substantial interest and penalty charges. Our customer contracts provide that our customers must pay all applicable sales taxes and fees. Nevertheless, customers may be reluctant to pay back taxes and may refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes. If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties, and if our customers fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will have incurred unplanned expenses that may be substantial. Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our services going forward will effectively increase the cost of such services to our customers and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or to gain new customers in the areas in which such taxes are imposed. We may also become subject to tax audits or similar procedures in states where we already pays sales and use taxes. The assessment of taxes, interest, and penalties as a result of audits, litigation, or otherwise could be materially adverse to our current and future results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend upon suppliers and have limited sources for some services.\nWe rely on other companies to supply some components of our network infrastructure and the means to access our network. Certain products and services that we resell and certain components that we require for our network are available only from limited sources. We could be adversely affected if such sources were to become unavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot ensure that, on an ongoing basis, we will be able to obtain third-party services cost-effectively and on the scale and within the time frames that we require, if at all. Failure to obtain or to continue to make use of such third-party services would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to properly manage the distribution of our services could result in a loss of revenues.\nWe currently sell our services both directly to customers and through channel partners. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect sales channels to reach various potential customers for our services is a complex process. Each sales channel has distinct risks and costs, and therefore, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the sales model for our services could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nWe incur significant accounting and administrative costs as a publicly traded corporation that impact our financial condition.\nAs a publicly traded corporation, we incur certain costs to comply with regulatory requirements. If regulatory requirements were to become more stringent or if controls thought to be effective later fail, we may be forced to make additional expenditures,\nthe amounts of which could be material. Some of our competitors are privately owned so their comparatively lower accounting and administrative costs can be a competitive disadvantage for us. Should our sales continue to decline or if we are unsuccessful at increasing prices to cover higher expenditures for internal controls and audits, ours costs associated with regulatory compliance will rise as a percentage of sales.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential stockholders may not be confident in our financial reporting, which could adversely affect the price of our stock and harm our business.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our annual report on Form 10-K its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Although we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place, we cannot be certain that our internal controls over financial reporting will remain effective. If we cannot adequately maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, we may be subject to liability and/or sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock.\nThe combined organization will need to raise additional capital by issuing securities or debt, which may cause significant dilution to the combined organization\u2019s stockholders and restrict the combined organization\u2019s operations.\nWe expect the combined organization will need to raise additional capital to fund its near and long-term operations. Additional financing may not be available to the combined organization when it needs it or may not be available on favorable terms. To the extent that the combined organization raises additional capital by issuing equity securities, the terms of such an issuance may cause more significant dilution to the combined organization\u2019s stockholders\u2019 ownership, and the terms of any new equity securities may have preferences over the combined organization\u2019s common stock. Any debt financing the combined organization enters into may involve covenants that restrict its operations. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of the combined organization\u2019s assets, as well as prohibitions on its ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem its stock or make investments.\nRisks Related to Our Business Resulting From the Coronavirus Pandemic\nThe coronavirus pandemic is an emerging serious threat to health and economic wellbeing affecting our employees, investors, customers, and other business partners.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that infections of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) had become pandemic, and on March 13, the U.S. President announced a National Emergency relating to the disease. There is a possibility of continued widespread infection in the United States and abroad, with the potential for catastrophic impact. National, state and local authorities have required or recommended social distancing and imposed or are considering quarantine and isolation measures on large portions of the population, including mandatory business closures. These measures, while intended to protect human life, are expected to have serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration. The effectiveness of economic stabilization efforts, including government payments to affected citizens and industries, is uncertain. Some economists are predicting the United States will soon enter a recession.\nThe sweeping nature of the coronavirus pandemic makes it extremely difficult to predict how the Company\u2019s business and operations will be affected in the longer run, but we expect that it may materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. Moreover, the coronavirus outbreak has begun to have indeterminable adverse effects on general commercial activity and the world economy, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that this coronavirus or any other epidemic harms the global economy generally and/or the markets in which we operate specifically.\nAny of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the coronavirus pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could materially increase our costs, negatively impact our sales and damage the company\u2019s results of operations and its liquidity position, possibly to a significant degree. The duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted.\nThe impact of any deterioration in the U.S. economy or in the financial condition of our customers, specifically, as a result of the coronavirus outbreak may negatively affect our business.\nA deterioration in the U.S. economy or our industry as a result of the coronavirus outbreak could result in a period of substantial turmoil. The impact of this event on our business and the severity of an economic crisis is uncertain. It is likely that a crisis (such as the coronavirus outbreak) in the U.S. economy could adversely affect our business, our current and potential customers, our vendors and prospects as well as our liquidity and financial condition. Further, our current and potential customers will likely be required to allocate resources and adjust budgets to accommodate potential contingencies related to the effects of the coronavirus and measures required to be put in place to prevent and contain contamination of the virus. An existing major customer of the Company suspended certain professional services we provided to the customer effective April 30, 2020 due to COVID-19. These services accounted for $0.7 million of the Company\u2019s revenue during the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2019, which represented 13% and 6% of the Company\u2019s revenue for these periods, respectively. Uncertainties resulting from COVID-19 may result in additional customers delaying budget expenditures or re-allocating resources, which would result in a decrease in orders from these customers. Any such decrease in orders from these customers could cause a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results and our ability to generate positive cash flows. Further, our current service offerings and our future growth may be minimized to a point that would be detrimental to our business development activities. These events would be detrimental to our business prospects and result in material negative changes to our operations and financial position.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated a risk exists of a pandemic in the United States, which would mean that the current methods in place to control of the spread of the virus have been ineffective. In such a situation, the effect on the economy and on the public may be severe. There are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of coronavirus and a potential pandemic, and, as a result, there is considerable uncertainty of its potential effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business activities will require additional financing that might not be obtainable on acceptable terms, if at all, given the coronavirus outbreak and resulting economic conditions. The failure to obtain such financing will likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and ability to operate going forward.\nAs discussed herein, we believe additional capital will be required to fund operations and provide growth capital including investments in technology, product development and sales and marketing. To access capital to fund operations or provide growth capital, we will need to restructure the SVB Loan Agreement and raise capital in one or more debt and/or equity offerings. However, given the economic effect of the recent coronavirus outbreak there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising necessary capital or that any such offering will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed on terms acceptable to us, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Failure to obtain financing, or obtaining financing on unfavorable terms, could result in a decrease in our stock price, would have a material adverse effect on future operating prospects, and could require us to significantly reduce operations.\nA material disruption in our workplace as a result of the coronavirus could affect our ability to carry on our business operations in the ordinary course and may require additional cost and effort should our employees continue to not be able to be physically on-premises.\nWhile many of our employees work remotely in the ordinary course, other employees work from our offices. Should we continue to experience periods where it is not prudent for some or all of these employees to be physically present on-site, we may not have the benefit of the time and skills of such employees or we may be required to adjust our current business operations and processes to permit some or all of such employees to work remotely in order to avoid the potential spread of the virus. In addition, for a currently indeterminate amount of time we may be forced to continue to suspend all non-essential travel for our employees and discourage employee attendance at industry events and in-person work-related meetings. We can offer no assurances that these adjustments would not cause material disruptions to our daily operations or require us to expend our time, energy and resources to make necessary adjustments, and they therefore may result in a material adverse effect on our sales, research and development and other critical areas of our business model. Also, it may continue to hamper our efforts to comply with our filing obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOur common stock may experience volatility in trading or loss in value as a result of the effects of the coronavirus on the U.S. and global economies.\nUncertainties surrounding the effects of the coronavirus on the United States and global economies has resulted in an increase in volatility and violent drops in the value of publicly traded securities, including the trading in our common stock. We can offer no assurances that these effects are temporary or that any losses that are incurred as a result of these uncertainties will be regained if and when this crisis has passed. As a result, the value of our stock remains subject to such volatility and potential loss of market value.\nRisks Related to the Merger with Oblong Industries\nOur acquisition of Oblong Industries in October 2019 could adversely affect our operations, financial results and financial condition.\nOn October 1, 2019, Glowpoint acquired Oblong Industries, a privately-held visual collaboration company that develops, manufactures and markets multi-stream, concurrent multi-user, multi-screen, multi-device, and multi-location technology platforms for dynamic and immersive visual collaboration. With respect to the acquisition of Oblong Industries and any future acquisitions, we may experience:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the acquired businesses and their respective personnel and products into our existing business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating commercial organizations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays in realizing the anticipated benefits of the acquisition;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nchallenges due to limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter;\n\u2022\ninability to successfully develop new products and services on a timely basis that address our new market opportunities post-acquisition;\n\u2022\ninability to compete effectively against companies already serving the broader market opportunities expected to be available to us post-acquisition; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs and other contingent liabilities.\nWe have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant cash and other resources in connection with our acquisition of Oblong Industries, integration of its business and development and commercialization of its products. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts. Should we be unable to obtain adequate financing or generate sufficient revenue in the future, our business, result of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be materially and adversely harmed.\nThe failure to successfully operate and integrate the former businesses of Glowpoint and Oblong Industries in the expected timeframe could adversely affect the combined organization\u2019s future results following the completion of the transaction.\nThe success of the Merger will depend, in large part, on the ability of the combined organization to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the former businesses of Glowpoint and Oblong Industries. The failure to operate and integrate successfully and to manage successfully the challenges presented by the integration process may result in the combined organization\u2019s failure to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nusing the combined organization\u2019s cash and other assets efficiently to develop the business of the combined organization;\n\u2022\nappropriately managing the liabilities of the combined organization;\n\u2022\nlimited experience of management in performing acquisitions and managing growth;\n\u2022\npotential unknown and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the transaction; and\n\u2022\nperformance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by integrating the companies\u2019 operations.\nIf we do not achieve the contemplated benefits of the Merger, our business and financial condition may be materially impaired.\nWe may not achieve the desired benefits from the Merger. For any of the reasons described above and elsewhere in this report and even if we are able to successfully operate Oblong Industries within the combined organization, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other growth that we anticipate from the Merger in the time frame that we currently expect, and the costs\nof achieving these benefits may be higher than what we currently expect, because of a number of risks, including the possibility that the Merger may not further our business strategy as we expected and risks related to contingent liabilities related to the Merger.\nThe conversion of our issued and outstanding shares of Series D and Series E Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock is contingent upon NYSE American approval.\nPursuant to the Certificates of Designations governing our Series D and Series E Preferred Stock, respectively, such shares are automatically convertible into shares of our common stock following the completion of both (i) approval of such conversion by our stockholders and (ii) receipt of all required authorizations and approvals from the NYSE American. We obtained stockholder approval for the conversion in December 2019. With respect to required approval from the NYSE American, we will be required to file an initial listing application with the NYSE American for the combined organization and to satisfy the initial listing requirements of such exchange in order to remain listed thereon. Receipt of the NYSE American\u2019s approval of such initial listing application will require the combined organization to meet the NYSE American\u2019s initial listing standards, including but not limited to standards with respect to such entity\u2019s market value of public float, which, given the Company\u2019s current financial situation, may be difficult or impossible for the combined organization to satisfy. In the event we receive NYSE American approval, then the issuance of such shares of common stock will result in substantial and significant dilution to the former Glowpoint stockholders, with Glowpoint\u2019s former stockholders only holding, in the aggregate, approximately 25% of the Company\u2019s fully diluted shares of common stock. Alternatively, in the event we do not receive NYSE American approval of the initial listing application, then the continued existence of the Series D and Series E Preferred Stock may hinder the Company\u2019s ability to seek additional equity and/or debt financing opportunities in the future. In addition, if the Series D and Series E Preferred Stock continue to remain outstanding:\n\u2022\nEach share of Series D and Series E Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive an annual dividend equal to 6.0% of its then-existing accrued value per annum, commencing on the first anniversary of its issuance;\n\u2022\nUpon any liquidation of the Company, the shares of Series D and Series E Preferred Stock will rank senior to the Company\u2019s common stock, but junior to the Company\u2019s outstanding Series A-2 Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock;\n\u2022\nHolders of Series D and Series E Preferred Stock will generally not have voting rights with respect to such shares, but for so long as at least twenty percent (20%) of the shares of Series D or Series E Preferred Stock issued by the Company are outstanding, respectively, the consent of such shares, as a class, will be required for the Company to take the following actions:\n\u25e6\nthe liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of the business and affairs of the Company, or the Company\u2019s consent to any of the foregoing;\n\u25e6\nthe amendment, altering or repeal of any provision of the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation or bylaws in any manner that adversely affects the powers, preferences or rights of the Series D or Series E Preferred Stock, respectively;\n\u25e6\ncreating, or authorizing the creation of, or issuance or obligation of the Company to issue shares of, any additional class or series of the Company\u2019s capital stock, other than Common Stock;\n\u25e6\ncertain reclassifications, alterings or amendments of any existing security of the Company that is pari passu with, or junior to, the Series D Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock, respectively;\n\u25e6\ntaking or approving any of the foregoing actions with respect to a subsidiary of the Company; or\n\u25e6\nauthorizing, creating or issuing any debt security, or permitting any subsidiary to take any such action with respect to any debt security, if the aggregate indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries for borrowed money following such action, in excess of the amount outstanding or available for borrowing under the Company\u2019s loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, would exceed $500,000.\nRisks to Owning Our Common Stock\nThroughout much of our history, our common stock has been thinly traded and subject to volatile price fluctuations.\nThroughout much of our corporate history, our common stock has been thinly traded, and has therefore been susceptible to wide price swings. Our common stock has historically traded on the NYSE American under the symbol \u201cGLOW.\u201d On March 9,\n2020, in connection with our name change to Oblong, Inc., we changed our ticker symbol to \u201cOBLG.\u201d While our common stock has recently experienced increased trading volume, we cannot ensure that this level of trading volume will continue, or that the increased trading volumes will lessen the historic volatility in the price for our common stock. Thinly traded stocks are more susceptible to significant and sudden price changes and the liquidity of our common stock depends upon the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers. At any time, the liquidity of our common stock may decrease to the thinly traded levels it has experienced in the past, and we cannot ensure that any holder of our securities will be able to find a buyer for its shares. Further, we cannot ensure that an organized public market for our securities will continue or that there will be any private demand for our common stock.\nWe could fail to satisfy the standards to maintain our listing on a stock exchange.\nWe could fail to satisfy the standards for continued exchange listing on the NYSE American, such as standards having to do with a minimum share price, the minimum number of public shareholders, a minimum amount of stockholders\u2019 equity or the aggregate market value of publicly held shares. As a result of each of the foregoing, we may be unable to maintain our listing on the NYSE American, which would negatively affect, among other things (i) our ability to raise capital on terms we deem advisable, or at all, and (ii) the liquidity of our common stock. Failure to obtain financing, or obtaining financing on unfavorable terms, could result in a decrease in our stock price, would have a material adverse effect on future operating prospects, and could require us to significantly reduce operations. Any holder of our securities should regard them as a long-term investment and should be prepared to bear the economic risk of an investment in such securities for an indefinite period.\nPenny stock regulations may impose certain restrictions on the marketability of our securities.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our common stock is presently subject to these regulations, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouse). For transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated by the SEC relating to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d market. The broker-dealer must also disclose the commission payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer\u2019s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the \u201cpenny stock\u201d held in the account and information on the limited market in \u201cpenny stocks.\u201d Consequently, the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may negatively affect the ability of purchasers of our shares of common stock to sell such securities.\nFuture operating results may vary from quarter to quarter, and we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors at any given time.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results. Factors that cause fluctuation in our results of operations include lack of revenue growth or declines in revenue and declines in gross margins and increases in operating expenses. Accordingly, it is possible that in one or more future quarters our operating results will be adversely affected and fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. If this happens, the trading price of our common stock may decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us and our stockholders to sell our equity securities in the future.\nThe sale into the public market of a significant number of shares issued upon the potential conversion of the Series D and Series E Preferred Stock (as discussed above) or in future financings, or the resale into the public market of shares issued in prior financings, could depress the trading price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us or our stockholders to sell equity securities in the future. Such transactions may include, but are not limited to (i) any future issuances by us of additional shares of our common stock or of other securities that are convertible or exchangeable for shares of common stock; (ii) the resale of any previously issued but restricted shares of our common stock that become freely available for re-sale, whether through an effective registration statement or under Rule 144 of the Securities Act; and (iii) future conversions of some or all of our outstanding Series C, Series D and Series E Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock, which may dilute the ownership interests of our common stockholders upon conversion, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issued upon such conversion, which could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nWhile the sale of shares to the public might increase the trading volume of our common stock and thus the liquidity of our stockholders\u2019 investments, the resulting increase in the number of shares available for public sale could drive the price of our common stock down, thus reducing the value of our stockholders\u2019 investment and perhaps hindering our ability to raise additional funds in the future.\nOur common stock ranks junior to our outstanding shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock with respect to any dividends and upon liquidation.\nThe rights of the holders of our common stock rank junior to the rights of the holders of our outstanding shares of preferred stock with respect to any dividends and payments upon the Company\u2019s liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Further, our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to authorize the issuance of additional series of preferred stock that would rank senior to our common stock with respect to any dividends and payments upon the Company\u2019s liquidation, dissolution or winding up.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.\nThe Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of the company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of the board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in the Company\u2019s management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on its board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors or a majority of our board of directors, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend the Company\u2019s amended and restated bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend the amended and restated bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the Merger.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the Merger for a number of reasons, including if:\n\u2022\ninvestors react negatively to the prospects of the combined organization\u2019s product line, business and financial condition;\n\u2022\nthe effect of the Merger on the combined organization\u2019s business and prospects is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts; or\n\u2022\nthe combined organization does not achieve the perceived benefits of the Merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts. Stockholders may not realize a benefit from the Merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the Merger.\nIf the combined organization is unable to realize the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger, stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests in their respective companies without receiving the expected commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the combined organization is able to realize only part of the expected strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger.", "PERMNO": 81761, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "OBLG"}
