{"cik": "25895", "company": "CROWN CRAFTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-06-09", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report and other filings made by the Company with the SEC should be considered in evaluating the Company\u2019s business. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently considered material may also impair the Company\u2019s business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, operating results may be affected in future periods.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business operations, employee availability, financial condition, liquidity and cash flow.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak, and the government and private sector responses thereto, has negatively impacted certain of the Company\u2019s customers who have been forced to temporarily close retail stores or have seen a significant decline in their sales. As a result, the Company experienced a decrease in sales to these customers beginning in March 2020. This decrease, however, has been somewhat offset by higher sales to other customers and sales in other channels, such as e-commerce.\nDue to the uncertainty as to the duration and widespread nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness of the vaccines on COVID-19 and variants thereof, and the extent to which the vaccines will be administered, the Company cannot currently predict the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations and financial results.\nThe uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have included adverse effects on the overall economy, the impact on the Company\u2019s supply chain, manufacturing and distribution operations, transportation services, customers and employees, as well as consumer sentiment in general and traffic within the retail stores that carry the Company\u2019s products. Several of the Company\u2019s customers have experienced financial difficulties as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. If these difficulties persist, these customers may close their retail stores permanently, reduce orders, file for bankruptcy or liquidate, any of which may negatively impact the Company\u2019s sales. The COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues, earnings, liquidity and cash flows and may require significant actions in response, including employee furloughs, closings of Company facilities, expense reductions or discounts of the pricing of the Company\u2019s products, all in an effort to mitigate such effects. Conditions surrounding COVID-19 change rapidly, and additional impacts of which the Company is not currently aware may arise.\nThe loss of one or more of the Company\u2019s key customers could result in a material loss of revenues.\nThe Company\u2019s top two customers represented approximately 68% of gross sales in fiscal year 2021. Although the Company does not enter into contracts with its key customers, it expects its key customers to continue to be a significant portion of its gross sales in the future. The loss of, or a decline in orders from, one or more of these customers could result in a material decrease in the Company\u2019s revenue and operating income.\nThe loss of one or more of the Company\u2019s licenses could result in a material loss of revenues.\nSales of licensed products represented 41% of the Company\u2019s gross sales in fiscal year 2021, which included 34% of sales associated with the Company\u2019s license agreements with Disney. The Company could experience a material loss of revenues if it is unable to renew its major license agreements or obtain new licenses. The volume of sales of licensed products is inherently tied to the success of the characters, films and other licensed programs of the Company\u2019s licensors. A decline in the popularity of these licensed programs or the inability of the licensors to develop new properties for licensing could also result in a material loss of revenues to the Company. Additionally, the Company\u2019s license agreements with Disney and others require a material amount of minimum guaranteed royalty payments. The failure by the Company to achieve the sales envisioned by the license agreements could result in the payment by the Company of shortfalls in the minimum guaranteed royalty payments, which would adversely impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe strength of the Company\u2019s competitors may impact the Company\u2019s ability to maintain and grow its sales, which could decrease the Company\u2019s revenues.\nThe infant and toddler consumer products industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with a variety of distributors and manufacturers, both branded and private label. The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends principally on styling, price, service to the retailer and continued high regard for the Company\u2019s products and trade names. Several of these competitors are larger than the Company and have greater financial resources than the Company, and some have experienced financial challenges from time to time, including servicing significant levels of debt. Those facing financial pressures could choose to make particularly aggressive pricing decisions in an attempt to increase revenue. The effects of increased competition could result in a material decrease in the Company\u2019s revenues.\nThe Company\u2019s business is impacted by general economic conditions and related uncertainties, including a declining birthrate, affecting markets in which the Company operates.\nThe Company\u2019s growth is largely dependent upon growth in the birthrate, and in particular, the rate of first births. Economic conditions, including the real and perceived threat of a recession, could lead individuals to decide to forgo or delay having children. Even under optimal economic conditions, shifts in demographic trends and preferences could have the consequence of individuals starting to have children later in life and/or having fewer children. In recent years, the birthrate in the United States has steadily declined. These conditions could result in reduced demand for some of the Company\u2019s products, increased order cancellations and returns, an increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories and increased pressure on the prices of the Company\u2019s products. Also, although the Company\u2019s use of a commercial factor significantly reduces the risk associated with collecting accounts receivable, such factor may at any time terminate or limit its approval of shipments to a particular customer, and the likelihood of such factor doing so may increase due to a change in economic conditions. Such an action by the factor could result in the loss of future sales to the affected customer.\nThe Company\u2019s success is dependent upon retaining key management personnel.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s executive management and other key personnel have been integral to the Company\u2019s operations and the execution of its growth strategy. The departure from the Company of one or more of these individuals, along with the inability of the Company to attract qualified and suitable individuals to fill the Company\u2019s open positions, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s growth and operating results.\nThe Company may need to write down or write off inventory.\nIf product programs end before the inventory is completely sold, then the remaining inventory may have to be sold at less than carrying value. The market value of certain inventory items could drop to below carrying value after a decline in sales, at the end of programs, or when management makes the decision to exit a product group. Such inventory would then need to be written down to the lower of carrying or market value, or possibly completely written off, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s sourcing and marketing operations in foreign countries are subject to anti-corruption laws.\nThe Company\u2019s foreign operations are subject to laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions, which apply to the Company\u2019s directors, officers, employees and agents acting on behalf of the Company. Failure to comply with these laws could result in damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, a diversion of management\u2019s attention from its business, increased legal and investigative costs, and civil and criminal penalties, any or all of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nRecalls or product liability claims could increase costs or reduce sales.\nThe Company must comply with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which imposes strict standards to protect children from potentially harmful products and which requires that the Company\u2019s products be tested to ensure that they are within acceptable levels for lead and phthalates. The Company must also comply with related regulations developed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and similar state regulatory authorities. The Company\u2019s products could be subject to involuntary recalls and other actions by these authorities, and concerns about product safety may lead the Company to voluntarily recall, accept returns or discontinue the sale of select products. Product liability claims could exceed or fall outside the scope of the Company\u2019s insurance coverage. Recalls or product liability claims could result in decreased consumer demand for the Company\u2019s products, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, a diversion of management\u2019s attention from its business and increased customer service and support costs, any or all of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nEconomic conditions could result in an increase in the amounts paid for the Company\u2019s products.\nSignificant increases in freight costs and the price of raw materials that are components of the Company\u2019s products, including cotton, oil and labor, could adversely affect the amounts that the Company must pay its suppliers for its finished goods. If the Company is unable to pass these cost increases along to its customers, its profitability could be adversely affected.\nChanges in international trade regulations and other risks associated with foreign trade could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sourcing.\nThe Company sources its products primarily from foreign contract manufacturers, with the largest concentration being in China. Difficulties encountered by these suppliers, such as fires, accidents, natural disasters, outbreaks of infectious diseases (including the COVID-19 outbreak) and the instability inherent in operating within an authoritarian political structure, could halt or disrupt production and shipment of the Company\u2019s products. The Chinese government could make allegations against the Company of corruption or antitrust violations, or could adopt regulations related to the manufacture of products within China, including quotas, duties, taxes and other charges or restrictions on the exportation of goods produced in China. Alternatively, the U.S. government could impose similar actions on the importation of goods manufactured in China. Any of these actions could result in an increase in the cost of the Company\u2019s products. Also, an arbitrary strengthening of the Chinese currency versus the U.S. Dollar could increase the prices at which the Company purchases finished goods. In addition, changes in U.S. customs procedures or delays in the clearance of goods through customs could result in the Company being unable to deliver goods to customers in a timely manner or the potential loss of sales altogether. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company could experience losses associated with its intellectual property.\nThe Company relies upon the fair interpretation and enforcement of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the U.S., similar laws in other countries, and agreements with employees, customers, suppliers, licensors and other parties. Such reliance serves to establish and maintain the intellectual property rights associated with the products that the Company develops and sells. However, the laws and courts of certain countries at times do not protect intellectual property rights or respect contractual agreements to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions the Company may not be able to protect its intellectual property rights against counterfeiting or enforce its contractual agreements with other parties. Specifically, as discussed above, the Company sources its products primarily from foreign contract manufacturers, with the largest concentration being in China. Article VII of the National Intelligence Law of China requires every commercial entity in China, by simple order of the Chinese government, to act as an agent of the government by committing espionage, technology theft, or whatever else the government deems to be in the national interest of China. Finally, a party could claim that the Company is infringing upon such party\u2019s intellectual property rights, and claims of this type could lead to a civil complaint. An unfavorable outcome in litigation involving intellectual property could result in any or all of the following: (i) civil judgments against the Company, which could require the payment of royalties on both past and future sales of certain products, as well as plaintiff\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and other litigation costs; (ii) impairment charges of up to the carrying value of the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights; (iii) restrictions on the ability of the Company to sell certain of its products; (iv) legal and other costs associated with investigations and litigation; and (v) adverse effects on the Company\u2019s competitive position.\nCustomer pricing pressures could result in lower selling prices, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s customers could place pressure on the Company to reduce the prices of its products. The Company continuously strives to stay ahead of its competition in sourcing, which allows the Company to obtain lower cost products while maintaining high standards for quality. There can be no assurance that the Company could respond to a decrease in sales prices by proportionately reducing its costs, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nDisruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology systems could negatively affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are highly dependent upon computer hardware and software systems, including customized information technology systems and cloud-based applications. The Company also employs third-party systems and software that are integral to its operations. These systems are vulnerable to cybersecurity incidents, including disruptions and security breaches, which can result from unintentional events or deliberate attacks by insiders or third parties, such as cybercriminals, competitors, nation-states, computer hackers and other cyber terrorists. The Company faces an evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats in which evildoers use a complex array of means to perpetrate attacks, including the use of stolen access credentials, malware, ransomware, phishing, structured query language injection attacks and distributed denial-of-service attacks.\nThe Company has implemented security measures to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information stored on the Company\u2019s information systems and continually invests in maintaining and upgrading the systems and applications to mitigate these risks. There can be no assurance that these measures and technology will adequately prevent an intrusion or that a third party that is relied upon by the Company will not suffer an intrusion, that unauthorized individuals will not gain access to confidential or proprietary information or that any such incident will be timely detected and effectively countered. A significant data security breach could result in negative consequences, including a disruption to the Company\u2019s operations and substantial remediation costs, such as liability for stolen assets or information, repairs of system damage, and incentives to customers or other business partners in an effort to maintain relationships after an attack. An assault against the Company\u2019s information technology infrastructure could also lead to other adverse impacts to its results of operations such as increased future cybersecurity protection costs, which may include the costs of making organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, and engaging third-party experts and consultants.\nA significant disruption to the Company\u2019s distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase transportation costs, which would decrease the Company\u2019s profits.\nNearly all of the Company\u2019s products are imported from China into the Port of Long Beach in Southern California. There are many links in the distribution chain, including the availability of ocean freight, cranes, dockworkers, containers, tractors, chassis and drivers. The timely receipt of the Company\u2019s products is also dependent upon efficient operations at the Port of Long Beach. Any shortages in the availability of any of these links or disruptions in port operations, including strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages or slowdowns, could cause bottlenecks and other congestion in the distribution network, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to obtain adequate inventory on a timely basis and result in lost sales, increased transportation costs and an overall decrease of the Company\u2019s profits.\nThe Company could experience adjustments to its effective tax rate or its prior tax obligations, either of which could adversely affect its results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the many jurisdictions in which it operates, including the U.S., several U.S. states and China. At any particular point in time, several tax years are subject to general examination or other adjustment by these various jurisdictions. In August 2020, the Company received notification from the Franchise Tax Board of the State of California (the \u201cFTB\u201d) of its intention to examine the Company\u2019s claims for refund made in connection with California consolidated income tax returns that the Company had filed for the fiscal years ended April 2, 2017, April 1, 2018 and March 31, 2019. In February 2021, the Company was notified by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service that they had selected for examination the Company\u2019s original and amended federal consolidated income tax returns for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2017. The ultimate resolution of these examinations could include administrative or legal proceedings. Although the Company believes that the calculations and positions taken on its original and amended filed returns are reasonable and justifiable, negotiations or litigation leading to the final outcome of any examination could result in an adjustment to the position that the Company has taken. Such adjustment could result in further adjustment to one or more income tax returns for other jurisdictions, or to income tax returns for prior or subsequent tax years, or both. To the extent that the Company\u2019s reserve for unrecognized tax liabilities is not adequate to support the cumulative effect of such adjustments, the Company could experience a material adverse impact on operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s provision for income taxes is based on its effective tax rate, which in any given financial statement period could fluctuate based on changes in tax laws or regulations, changes in the mix and level of earnings by taxing jurisdiction, changes in the amount of certain expenses within the consolidated statements of income that will never be deductible on the Company\u2019s income tax returns and certain charges deducted on the Company\u2019s income tax returns that are not included within the consolidated statements of income. These changes could cause fluctuations in the Company\u2019s effective tax rate either on an absolute basis, or in relation to varying levels of the Company\u2019s pre-tax income. Such fluctuations in the Company\u2019s effective tax rate could adversely affect its results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s ability to comply with its credit facility is subject to future performance and other factors.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to make required payments of principal and interest on its debts, to refinance its maturing indebtedness, to fund capital expenditures or to comply with its debt covenants will depend upon future performance. The Company\u2019s future performance is, to a certain extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond its control. The breach of any of the debt covenants could result in a default under the Company\u2019s credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Company\u2019s lender could make an immediate demand of the amount outstanding under the credit facility. If a default was to occur and such a demand was to be made, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s assets would be sufficient to repay the indebtedness in full.\nThe Company\u2019s debt covenants may affect its liquidity or limit its ability to pursue acquisitions, incur debt, make investments, sell assets or complete other significant transactions.\nThe Company\u2019s credit facility contains usual and customary covenants regarding significant transactions, including restrictions on other indebtedness, liens, transfers of assets, investments and acquisitions, merger or consolidation transactions, transactions with affiliates and changes in or amendments to the organizational documents for the Company and its subsidiaries. Unless waived by the Company\u2019s lender, these covenants could limit the Company\u2019s ability to pursue opportunities to expand its business operations, respond to changes in business and economic conditions and obtain additional financing, or otherwise engage in transactions that the Company considers beneficial.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to anticipate and respond to consumers\u2019 tastes and preferences could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues.\nSales are driven by consumer demand for the Company\u2019s products. There can be no assurance that the demand for the Company\u2019s products will not decline or that the Company will be able to anticipate and respond to changes in demand related to consumers\u2019 tastes and preferences. The infant and toddler consumer products industry is characterized by the continual development of cutting-edge new products to meet the high standards of parents. The Company\u2019s failure to adapt to these changes or to develop new products could lead to lower sales and excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by the Company to adequately comply with new laws and regulations could substantially harm its results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations governing the Internet and e-commerce. On June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., et al. The Court held that a state may require a business to collect and remit sales taxes even if the business has no physical presence within the state. In response, most states have enacted laws or otherwise issued administrative guidance regarding their intent to require the collection and remittance of sales tax on orders of products that are made through the Internet and are subsequently shipped to customers within their states. The Company routinely makes shipments of its products into thousands of jurisdictions throughout the U.S. within which the Company does not have a physical presence. The Wayfair decision is central to an evolving framework of laws and regulations that is subject to interpretation and application in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. The Company provides no assurance that its practices have complied, are currently complying, or will comply fully and adequately with all such laws and regulations. Any failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to the Company\u2019s reputation or a loss or reduction of orders. As the Company complies with such laws and regulations by charging, collecting and remitting sales tax, its customers will see an immediate and significant increase in the total order cost of the Company\u2019s products as such taxes are imposed, which will make the pricing of the Company\u2019s products less competitive when compared with a business that might not be required to charge, collect and remit sales taxes.\nThe Company\u2019s application for registration for sales tax within a jurisdiction will also often trigger obligations for other licensing and filing requirements within the jurisdiction. Compliance with such laws and regulations will place an additional burden on the Company by requiring a significant investment and continuing costs, as well as efforts of the Company\u2019s key management personnel. Also, the Company at any time could be subjected to examinations by any of the jurisdictions into which the Company may have at one time or another shipped its products, which could result in the assessment on the Company of a significant accumulation of uncollected taxes, along with penalties and interest. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to successfully identify, consummate and integrate acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial results, business and prospects.\nAs part of its business strategy, the Company has made acquisitions of businesses, divestitures of businesses and assets, and has entered into other transactions to further the interests of the Company\u2019s business and its stockholders. Risks associated with such activities include the following, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results:\n\u25cf\nThe active management of acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions requires varying levels of Company resources, including the efforts of the Company\u2019s key management personnel, which could divert attention from the Company\u2019s ongoing business operations.\n\u25cf\nThe Company may not fully realize the anticipated benefits and expected synergies of any particular acquisition or investment, or may experience a prolonged timeframe for realizing such benefits and synergies.\n\u25cf\nIncreased or unexpected costs, unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations could make acquisitions and investments less profitable or unprofitable.\n\u25cf\nThe failure to retain executive management members and other key personnel of the acquired business that may have been integral to the operations and the execution of the growth strategy of the acquired business.\nA stockholder could lose all or a portion of his or her investment in the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock has historically experienced a degree of price variability, and the price could be subject to rapid and substantial fluctuations. The Company\u2019s common stock has also historically been thinly traded, a circumstance that exists when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders for the Company\u2019s common stock at any given point in time. In such situations, a stockholder may be unable to liquidate his or her position in the Company\u2019s common stock at the desired price. Also, as an equity investment, a stockholder\u2019s investment in the Company is subordinate to the interests of the Company\u2019s creditors, and a stockholder could lose all or a substantial portion of his or her investment in the Company in the event of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy filing or liquidation.", "PERMNO": 59256, "SIC": 2211, "TIC": "CRWS"}
