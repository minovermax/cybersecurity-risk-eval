RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nNatural gas, oil and NGL prices and basis differentials greatly affect our revenues and thus profits, liquidity, growth, ability to repay our debt and the value of our assets.\nOur revenues, profitability, liquidity, growth, ability to repay our debt and the value of our assets greatly depend on prices for natural gas, oil and NGLs. The markets for these commodities are volatile, and we expect that volatility to continue. The prices of natural gas, oil and NGLs fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand (global, regional and local), transportation costs, market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control. Short- and long-term prices are subject to a myriad of factors such as:\n\u2022overall demand, including the relative cost of competing sources of energy or fuel;\n\u2022overall supply, including costs of production;\n\u2022the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, other transportation facilities and gathering, processing and storage facilities;\n\u2022regional basis differentials;\n\u2022national and worldwide economic and political conditions;\n\u2022weather conditions and seasonal trends;\n\u2022government regulations, such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price controls;\n\u2022inventory levels; and\n\u2022market perceptions of future prices, whether due to the foregoing factors or others.\nFor example, in 2021 and 2020, the NYMEX settlement price for natural gas ranged from a low of $1.50 per MMBtu in July 2020 to a high of $6.20 per MMBtu in November 2021, and during these periods our production was 82% and 79% natural gas, respectively. Although we hedge a large portion of our production against changing prices, derivatives do not protect all our future volumes, may result in our forgoing profit opportunities if markets rise and, for NGLs, are not always available for substantial periods into the future. In 2021, we paid $1,492 million, net of amounts we received, in settlement of hedging arrangements due to increased commodity pricing.\nLower natural gas, oil and NGL prices directly reduce our revenues and thus our operating income and cash flow. Lower prices also reduce the projected profitability of further drilling and therefore are likely to reduce our drilling activity, which in turn means we will have fewer wells on production in the future. Lower prices also reduce the value of our assets, both by a direct reduction in what the production would be worth and by making some properties uneconomic, resulting in non-cash impairments to the recorded value of our reserves and non-cash charges to earnings. For example, in 2020, we reported non-cash impairment charges on our natural gas and oil properties totaling $2,825 million, primarily resulting from decreases in trailing 12-month average first-day-of-the-month natural gas prices throughout 2020, as compared to 2019. Although general commodity prices increased in 2021, further non-cash impairments in future periods could occur if the trailing 12-month commodity prices decrease as compared to the average used in prior periods.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $5.4 billion of debt outstanding, consisting principally of senior notes maturing in various increments from 2022 to 2032, $550 million of term loan borrowings maturing in 2027 and $460 million of borrowings under our 2018 credit facility (defined below), which matures in 2024. At current commodity price levels, our net cash flow from operations is substantially higher than our interest obligations under this debt, but significant drops in realized prices could affect our ability to pay our current obligations or refinance our debt as it becomes due.\nMoreover, general industry conditions may make it difficult or costly to refinance increments of this debt as it matures. Although our indentures do not contain significant covenants restricting our operations and other activities, our bank credit agreements contain financial covenants with which we must comply. We refer you to the risk factor \u201cOur current and future levels of indebtedness may adversely affect our results and limit our growth.\u201d Our inability to pay our current obligations or refinance our debt as it becomes due could have a material and adverse effect on our company. A sustained drop in commodity\nprices, such as was generally experienced from 2014 to 2020, could reduce our revenues, profits and cash flow, cause us to record significant non-cash asset impairments and lead us to reduce both our level of capital investing and our workforce.\nSignificant capital investment is required to develop and replace our reserves and conduct our business.\nOur activities require substantial capital investment, not only to expand revenues but also because production from existing wells and thus revenues declines each year. We intend to fund our future capital investing through net cash flows from operations, net of changes in working capital. Our ability to generate operating cash flow is subject to many of the risks and uncertainties that exist in our industry, some of which we may not be able to anticipate at this time. Future cash flows from operations are subject to a number of risks and variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, prices of natural gas, oil and NGLs, our success in developing and producing new reserves and the other risk factors discussed herein. If we are unable to fund capital investing, we could experience a further reduction in drilling new wells, acquiring new acreage and a loss of existing leased acreage, resulting in a decline in our cash flow from operations and natural gas, oil and NGL production and reserves.\nIf we are not able to develop and replace reserves, our production levels and thus our revenues and profits may decline.\nProduction levels from existing wells decline over time, and drilling new wells requires an inventory of leases and other rights with reserves that have not yet been drilled. Our future success depends largely upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional natural gas, oil and NGL reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful development, acquisition or exploration activities, our proved reserves and production will decline over time. Identifying and exploiting new reserves requires significant capital investment and successful drilling operations. Thus, our future natural gas, oil and NGL reserves and production, and therefore our revenues and profits, are highly dependent on our level of capital investments, our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves.\nOur business depends on access to natural gas, oil and NGL gathering, processing and transportation systems and facilities. Changes to access and cost of these systems and facilities could adversely impact our business and financial condition. Our commitments to assure availability of transportation could lead to substantial payments for capacity we do not use if production falls below projected levels.\nThe marketability of our natural gas, oil and NGL production depends in large part on the operation, availability, proximity, capacity and expansion of transportation systems and facilities owned by third parties. For example, we can provide no assurance that sufficient transportation capacity will exist for expected production from Appalachia or Haynesville, or that we will be able to obtain sufficient transportation capacity on economic terms. During the past few years, several planned pipelines intended to service production in the Northeast United States have experienced delays in their in-service dates due to regulatory delays and litigation.\nProducers compete by lowering their sales prices, resulting in the locational differences from NYMEX pricing. Further, a lack of available capacity on transportation systems and facilities or delays in their planned expansions could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of drilling plans for properties. A lack of availability of these systems and facilities for an extended period of time could negatively affect our revenues. In addition, we have entered into contracts for firm transportation and any failure to renew those contracts on the same or better commercial terms could increase our costs and our exposure to the risks described above.\nWe have entered into gathering agreements in producing areas and multiple long-term firm transportation agreements relating to natural gas volumes from all our producing areas. As of December 31, 2021, our aggregate demand charge commitments under these firm transportation agreements and gathering agreements were approximately $10.5 billion. If our development programs fail to produce sufficient quantities of natural gas and ethane to fill the contracted capacity within expected timeframes, we would be required to pay demand or other charges for transportation on pipelines and gathering systems for capacity that we would not be fully utilizing. In those situations, which have occurred on a small scale at various times, we endeavor to sell or transfer that capacity to others or fill the excess capacity with production purchased from third parties. There can be no assurance that these measures will recoup the full cost of the unused transportation.\nStrategic determinations, including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities, are challenging in the face of shifting market conditions, and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our future growth rate.\nWe necessarily must consider future price and cost environments when deciding how much capital we are likely to have available from net cash flow and how best to allocate it. Our current philosophy is to generally operate within cash flow from operations, net of changes in working capital, and to invest capital in a portfolio of projects that are projected to generate the\nhighest combined Internal Rate of Return. Volatility in prices and potential errors in estimating costs, reserves or timing of production of the reserves can result in uneconomic projects or economic projects generating less than anticipated returns.\nCertain of our undeveloped assets are subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.\nApproximately 64,030 and 9,101 net acres of our Appalachia and Haynesville acreage, respectively, will expire in the next three years if we do not drill successful wells to develop the acreage or otherwise take action to extend the leases. Our ability to drill wells depends on a number of factors, including certain factors that are beyond our control, such as the ability to obtain permits on a timely basis or to compel landowners or lease holders on adjacent properties to cooperate. Further, we may not have sufficient capital to drill all the wells necessary to hold the acreage without increasing our debt levels, or given price projections at the time, drilling may not be projected to achieve a sufficient return or be judged to be the best use of our capital. To the extent we do not drill the wells, our rights to acreage can be lost.\nOur proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are estimates that include uncertainties. Any material changes to these uncertainties or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated.\nAs described in more detail under \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Natural Gas and Oil Properties\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report, our reserve data represents the estimates of our reservoir engineers made under the supervision of our management, and our reserve estimates are audited each year by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., or NSAI, an independent petroleum engineering firm. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas, oil and NGLs that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as using historic natural gas, oil and NGL prices rather than future projections. Additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital investing, taxes and availability of funds. Furthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data.\nResults of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate. Accordingly, initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas, oil and NGLs that are ultimately recovered, and such variances may be material. Any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the preceding 12-month average natural gas, oil and NGL index prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general.\nNatural gas and oil drilling and producing and transportation operations are complex and can be hazardous and may expose us to liabilities. Incidents related to HSE performance and our asset and operating integrity could adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nDrilling and production operations are subject to many risks, including well blowouts, cratering and explosions, pipe failures, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids, severe weather, natural disasters, groundwater contamination and other environmental hazards and risks. Some of these risks or hazards could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses by reducing or shutting in production from wells, loss of equipment or otherwise negatively impacting the projected economic performance of our prospects. If any of these risks occurs, we could sustain substantial losses as a result of:\n\u2022injury or loss of life;\n\u2022severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources or equipment;\n\u2022pollution or other environmental damage;\n\u2022clean-up responsibilities;\n\u2022regulatory investigations and administrative, civil and criminal penalties; and\n\u2022injunctions resulting in limitation or suspension of operations.\nFor our properties that we do not operate, we depend on the operator for operational and regulatory compliance.\nWe rely on third parties to transport our production to markets. Their operations, and thus our ability to reach markets, are subject to all of the risks and operational hazards inherent in transporting natural gas and ethane and natural gas compression, including:\n\u2022damages to pipelines, facilities and surrounding properties caused by third parties, severe weather, natural disasters, including hurricanes, and acts of terrorism;\n\u2022maintenance, repairs, mechanical or structural failures;\n\u2022damages to, loss of availability of and delays in gaining access to interconnecting third-party pipelines;\n\u2022disruption or failure of information technology systems and network infrastructure due to various causes, including unauthorized access or attack; and\n\u2022leaks of natural gas or ethane as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities.\nA material event such as those described above could expose us to liabilities, monetary penalties or interruptions in our business operations. Although we may maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above, our insurance may not be adequate to cover casualty losses or liabilities, and our insurance does not cover penalties or fines that may be assessed by a governmental authority. Also, in the future we may not be able to obtain insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase.\nWe have made significant investments in oilfield service businesses, including our drilling rigs, water infrastructure and pressure pumping equipment, to lower costs and secure inputs for our operations and transportation for our production. If our development and production activities are curtailed or disrupted, we may not recover our investment in these activities, which could adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, our continued expansion of these operations may adversely impact our relationships with third-party providers.\nWe also have made investments to meet certain of our field services\u2019 needs, including establishing our own drilling rig operation, water transportation system in Appalachia and pressure pumping capability. If our level of operations is reduced for a long period, we may not be able to recover these investments. Further, our presence in these service and supply sectors, including competing with them for qualified personnel and supplies, may have an adverse effect on our relationships with our existing third-party service and resource providers or our ability to secure these services and resources from other providers.\nOur business depends on the availability of water and the ability to dispose of water. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to obtain or dispose of water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle water after use, could adversely impact our operations. In some cases, water may need to be obtained from new sources and transported to drilling sites, resulting in increased costs. Moreover, the introduction of new environmental initiatives and regulations related to water acquisition or waste water disposal, including produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of hydrocarbons, could limit or prohibit our ability to utilize hydraulic fracturing or waste water injection control wells.\nIn addition, concerns have been raised about the potential for seismic activity to occur from the use of underground injection control wells, a predominant method for disposing of waste water from oil and gas activities. New rules and regulations may be developed to address these concerns, possibly limiting or eliminating the ability to use disposal wells in certain locations and increasing the cost of disposal in others. We utilize third parties to dispose of waste water associated with our operations. These third parties may operate injection wells and may be subject to regulatory restrictions relating to seismicity.\nCompliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of water necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells or the disposal of water may increase our operating costs or may cause us to delay, curtail or discontinue our exploration and development plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA large portion of our producing properties remain concentrated in the Appalachian basin, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in limited geographic areas.\nA large portion of our producing properties currently are geographically concentrated in the Appalachian basin in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. At December 31, 2021, approximately 73% of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in the Appalachian basin. As a result, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, state and local politics, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, availability of equipment and personnel, water shortages or interruption of the processing or transportation of natural gas, oil or NGLs.\nMany of our business operations depend on activities performed by third parties. Changes to availability, costs and performance of personnel, products and services provided by third parties could adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nWe rely on third-party service providers to perform necessary drilling and completion and other related operations. The ability of third-party service providers to perform such operations will depend on those service providers' ability to compete for and retain qualified personnel as well as their financial condition, economic performance and ability to access capital, which in turn will depend upon the supply and demand for natural gas, oil and NGLs, prevailing economic conditions, and financial, business and other factors. The failure of a third-party service provider to adequately perform operations could delay drilling or completion or reduce production from the property and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to the ability of our customers to receive our products or meet their financial, performance and other obligations to us could adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nIn addition to credit risk related to receivables from commodity derivative contracts, our principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from the sale of our natural gas, oil and NGL production that we market to energy companies, end users and refineries ($903 million as of December 31, 2021). We are also subject to credit risk due to concentration of receivables with several significant customers. The largest purchaser of our products during the year ended December 31, 2021 accounted for approximately 12% of our product revenues. We do not require all of our customers to post collateral. The inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial condition.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to market natural gas, oil and NGLs, to secure trained personnel and appropriate services, to obtain additional properties and to raise capital.\nOur cost of operations is highly dependent on third-party services, and competition for these services can be significant, especially in times when commodity prices are rising. Similarly, we compete for trained, qualified personnel, and in times of lower prices for the commodities we produce, we and other companies with similar production profiles may not be able to attract and retain this talent. Our ability to acquire and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing natural gas, oil and NGLs and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and gas industry. Certain of our competitors may possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources greater than ours. Those companies may be able to pay more for personnel, property and services and to attract capital at lower rates. This may become more likely if prices for oil and NGLs increase faster than prices for natural gas, as natural gas comprises a greater percentage of our overall production than it does for most of the companies with whom we compete for talent.\nWe may be unable to dispose of assets on attractive terms, and may be required to retain liabilities for certain matters.\nVarious factors could materially affect our ability to dispose of assets if and when we decide to do so, including the availability of purchasers willing to purchase the assets at prices acceptable to us, particularly in times of reduced and volatile commodity prices. Sellers typically retain liabilities for certain matters. The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately may be material. Also, as is typical in divestiture transactions, third parties may be unwilling to release us from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets. As a result, after a sale, we may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations.\nChanges to applicable U.S. tax laws and regulations could affect our business and future profitability.\nNew U.S. laws and policy relating to taxes may have an adverse effect on us and our business and future profitability. Further, existing U.S. tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. The current administration has set forth, and Congress is considering, several tax proposals that would make\nsignificant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, if enacted. It is unclear whether Congress will enact these proposals or similar changes and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could take effect. The elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies may be proposed in the future. These changes may include, among other proposals:\n\u2022repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for natural gas and oil properties;\n\u2022elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; and\n\u2022extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures.\nThe passage of any such proposals, or any similar legislation, could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes will be limited.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had substantial amounts of net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and other attributes for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Due to the issuance of common stock associated with the Indigo Merger, we incurred a cumulative ownership change under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cCode\u201d), and as such, our NOLs and other attributes prior to the acquisition are subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Code of approximately $48 million. The ownership change and resulting annual limitation will result in the expiration of NOLs or other tax attributes otherwise available. At December 31, 2021, we had approximately $4 billion of federal NOL carryovers, of which approximately $3 billion have an expiration date between 2035 and 2037 and $1 billion have an indefinite carryforward life. We currently estimate that approximately $2 billion of these federal NOLs will expire before they are able to be used. If a subsequent ownership change were to occur as a result of future transactions in our common stock, our use of remaining U.S. tax attributes may be further limited.\nWe may experience adverse or unforeseen tax consequences due to further developments affecting our deferred tax assets which could significantly affect our results of operations.\nDeferred tax assets, including NOLs, represent future savings of taxes that would otherwise be paid in cash. As discussed above, at December 31, 2021, we had substantial amounts of NOLs for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets is dependent on the amount of future pre-tax income that we are able to generate through our operations or sale of assets and the applicable U.S. federal income tax and foreign tax laws. If management concludes that it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance will be recognized in the period that this conclusion is reached.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including certain exploration, development and production activities as well as processing of revenues and payments. We depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud applications and services, to process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, communicate with employees and business associates, perform compliance reporting and in many other activities related to our business. Our vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production and financial institutions are also dependent on digital technology.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business associates may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches, which could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or protected information, corruption of data or other disruptions of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period.\nA cyber-attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of companies with which we deal, could disrupt our business and negatively impact our operations in a variety of ways, including:\n\u2022unauthorized access to seismic data, reserves information, strategic information or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for natural gas and oil resources;\n\u2022unauthorized access to personal identifying information of property lessors, working interest partners, employees and vendors, which could expose us to allegations that we did not sufficiently protect that information;\n\u2022data corruption or operational disruption of production infrastructure could result in loss of production, or accidental discharge;\n\u2022a cyber-attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions, which could delay or halt our major development projects; and\n\u2022a cyber-attack on a third party gathering, pipeline or rail service provider could delay or prevent us from marketing our production, resulting in a loss of revenues.\nThese events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nTo date we have not experienced any material losses or interruptions relating to cyber-attacks; however, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nTerrorist activities could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks, whether domestic or foreign attacks, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. Continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the global economy in unpredictable ways, including the disruption of energy supplies and markets, increased volatility in commodity prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism, and, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe physical impacts of adverse weather may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe physical effects of adverse weather conditions, such as increased frequency and severity of droughts, storms, floods and other climatic events, could adversely affect or delay demand for our products or cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for, or responding to, the effects of climatic events themselves. Potential adverse effects could include disruption of our production activities, including, for example, damages to our facilities from winds or floods, increases in our costs of operation or reductions in the efficiency of our operations, impacts on our personnel, supply chain or distribution chain, as well as potentially increased costs for insurance coverages in the aftermath of such effects. Our ability to mitigate the physical impacts of adverse weather conditions depends in part upon our disaster preparedness and response along with our business continuity planning.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry and increasing attention to ESG matters could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about climate change, emissions, hydraulic fracturing, seismicity, oil spills and explosions of transmission lines, may lead to increased litigation risk and regulatory, legislative and judicial scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business. In addition, various officials and candidates at the federal, state and local levels, including some presidential candidates, have proposed banning hydraulic fracturing altogether.\nFurther, increasing attention to climate change, societal expectations on companies to address climate change, investor and societal expectations regarding voluntary ESG disclosures, generally, and fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, and increasing consumer demand for alternative forms of energy or energy efficiency initiatives or products may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. Moreover, while we create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters from time to time, some of the statements in those voluntary disclosures may be based on hypothetical expectations and assumptions that may or may not be representative of current or actual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring and reporting on many ESG matters. In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings could lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us and our industry and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital. In addition, failure or a perception (whether or not valid) of failure to implement our\nESG strategy or achieve ESG goals, including any greenhouse gas emission goals, could damage our reputation, causing our investors or consumers to lose confidence in our Company and brands, and negatively impact our operations.\nJudicial decisions can affect our rights and obligations.\nOur ability to develop gas, oil and NGLs depends on the leases and other mineral rights we acquire and the rights of owners of nearby properties. We operate in areas where judicial decisions have not yet definitively interpreted various contractual provisions or addressed relevant aspects of property rights, nuisance and other matters that could be the source of claims against us as a developer or operator of properties. Although we plan our activities according to our expectations of these unresolved areas, based on decisions on similar issues in these jurisdictions and decisions from courts in other states that have addressed them, courts could resolve issues in ways that increase our liabilities or otherwise restrict or add costs to our operations.\nCommon stockholders will be diluted if additional shares are issued.\nWe endeavor to create value for our stockholders on a per share basis. From time to time we have issued stock to raise capital for our business or as consideration for acquisitions, including significant offerings of new shares in 2015, 2016, 2020 and 2021. We also issue restricted stock, options and performance share units to our employees and directors as part of their compensation. In addition, we may issue additional shares of common stock, additional notes or other securities or debt convertible into common stock, to extend maturities or fund capital expenditures. If we issue additional shares of our common stock in the future, it may have a dilutive effect on our current outstanding stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and under Delaware law may impede or discourage a takeover, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, protective provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws or the implementation by our Board of Directors of a stockholder rights plan that could deter a takeover.\nLoss of our key executive officers or other personnel, or an inability to attract and retain such officers and personnel, could negatively affect our business.\nOur future success depends on the skills, experience and efforts of our key executive officers. The sudden loss of any of these executives\u2019 services or our failure to appropriately plan for any expected key executive succession could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. Additionally, we also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business. Workers may choose to pursue employment with our competitors or in other fields; this competition has become exacerbated by the increase in employee resignations currently taking place throughout the United States. If we fail to attract or retain talented new employees, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected, and may in the future negatively affect, our business, operating results and financial condition.\nCOVID-19 has resulted in volatile economic conditions, business and supply chain disruptions and significant volatility and disruption of markets, particularly at the beginning of the pandemic. As a result of COVID-19, we have experienced, and may experience in the future, among other things, a reduction in demand for natural gas, oil, NGLs and other products derived therefrom, and may experience in the future reduced availability of personnel, equipment and services critical to our ability to operate our properties, which could in the future adversely impact, our business, results of operations and overall financial performance. Although several COVID-19 vaccines are currently being widely administered globally, the severity, magnitude and duration of the economic effects of the virus (including any emerging variants) continue to evolve, remain uncertain and may be impacted by various factors beyond our knowledge or control. As such, we might not be able to predict, or respond to, all impacts on a timely basis to prevent near- or long-term adverse impacts on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. These impacts may be material. Additionally, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness and Financing Abilities\nA downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital and our liquidity.\nActual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, could impact our ability to access debt markets in the future to refinance existing debt or obtain\nadditional funds, affect the market value of our senior notes and increase our borrowing costs. Such ratings are limited in scope, and do not address all material risks relating to us, but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency of the likelihood we will be able to repay our debt at the time the rating is issued. An explanation of the significance of each rating may be obtained from the applicable rating agency. As of February 25, 2022, our long-term issuer ratings were Ba2 by Moody\u2019s, BB+ by Standard and Poor\u2019s and BB by Fitch Investor Services. There can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances so warrant.\nActual downgrades in our credit ratings may also impact our interest costs and liquidity. The interest rates under certain of our senior notes increases as credit ratings fall. Many of our existing commercial contracts contain, and future commercial contracts may contain, provisions permitting the counterparty to require increased security upon the occurrence of a downgrade in our credit rating. Providing additional security, such as posting letters of credit, could reduce our available cash or our liquidity under our 2018 credit facility for other purposes. We had $160 million of letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2021. The amount of additional financial assurance would depend on the severity of the downgrade from the credit rating agencies, and a downgrade could result in a decrease in our liquidity.\nOur current and future levels of indebtedness may adversely affect our results and limit our growth.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had total indebtedness of $5.4 billion. The terms of the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes, our credit facilities, and the lease agreements relating to our drilling rigs, other equipment and headquarters building, which we collectively refer to as our \u201cfinancing agreements,\u201d impose restrictions on our ability and, in some cases, the ability of our subsidiaries to take a number of actions that we may otherwise desire to take, which may include, without limitation, one or more of the following:\n\u2022incurring additional debt;\n\u2022redeeming stock or redeeming certain debt;\n\u2022making certain investments;\n\u2022creating liens on our assets; and\n\u2022selling assets.\nThe revolving credit facility we entered into in April 2018, as amended (our \u201c2018 credit facility\u201d), contains customary representations, warranties and covenants including, among others, the following covenants:\n\u2022a prohibition against incurring debt, subject to permitted exceptions;\n\u2022a restriction on creating liens on assets, subject to permitted exceptions;\n\u2022restrictions on mergers and asset dispositions;\n\u2022restrictions on use of proceeds, investments, transactions with affiliates, or change of principal business; and\n\u2022maintenance of the following financial covenants, commencing with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2018:\n1.Minimum current ratio of no less than 1.00 to 1.00, whereby current ratio is defined as the Company\u2019s consolidated current assets (including unused commitments under the credit agreement, but excluding non-cash derivative assets) to consolidated current liabilities (excluding non-cash derivative obligations and current maturities of long-term debt).\n2.Maximum total net leverage ratio of no greater than 4.00 to 1.00 subsequent to June 30, 2020. Total net leverage ratio is defined as total debt less cash on hand (up to the lesser of 10% of credit limit or $150 million) divided by consolidated EBITDAX for the last four consecutive quarters. For purposes of calculating consolidated EBITDAX, the Company can include the Indigo and GEPH consolidated EBITDAX prior to the respective Mergers for the same rolling twelve-month period. EBITDAX, as defined in our 2018 credit facility, excludes the effects of interest expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization, income tax, any non-cash impacts from impairments, certain non-cash hedging activities, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash gains or losses on asset sales, unamortized issuance cost, unamortized debt discount and certain restructuring costs.\nIn conjunction with the October 2020 redetermination process, the Company entered into an amendment to the credit agreement governing the 2018 credit facility to, among other matters:\n\u2022limit the Company's unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to $200 million when loans under the 2018 credit facility are outstanding, subject to certain exceptions; and\n\u2022increase the applicable rate by 25 basis points on loans outstanding under the 2018 credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all of the covenants of our 2018 credit facility. Our ability to comply with these financial covenants depends in part on the success of our development program and upon factors beyond our control, such as the market prices for natural gas, oil and NGLs.\nOur level of indebtedness and off-balance sheet obligations, and the covenants contained in our financing agreements, could have important consequences for our operations, including:\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital investing and other general business activities;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital investing, acquisitions and general corporate and other activities;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022detracting from our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy generally.\nAny significant reduction in the borrowing base under our 2018 credit facility may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay borrowings under our 2018 credit facility if required as a result of a borrowing base redetermination.\nThe amount we may borrow under our 2018 credit facility is capped at the lower of the total of our bank commitments and a \u201cborrowing base\u201d determined from time to time by the lenders based on our reserves, market conditions and other factors. As of December 31, 2021, the elected borrowing base and total aggregate commitments were $2.0 billion, which was most recently reaffirmed as of October 2021. The borrowing base is subject to scheduled semiannual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on our natural gas, oil and NGL reserves and other factors. As of December 31, 2021, we had $460 million of outstanding borrowings under our 2018 credit facility, and we expect to borrow under that facility in the future. As of December 31, 2021, we had $160 million of letters of credit issued under the 2018 credit facility and unused borrowing capacity was approximately $1.4 billion which exceeds our currently modeled needs. Any significant reduction in our borrowing base as a result of borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and cash flow. Further, if the outstanding borrowings under our 2018 credit facility were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of any such redetermination or other reasons, we would be required to repay the excess within a brief period. We may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments. If we do not have sufficient funds and we are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing, we may have to sell significant assets. Any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in our financing agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic and financial conditions.\nFailure to comply with the covenants and other restrictions could lead to an event of default and the acceleration of our obligations under our senior notes, credit facilities or other financing agreements, and in the case of the lease agreements for drilling rigs, compressors and pressure pumping equipment, loss of use of the equipment. In particular, the occurrence of risks identified elsewhere in this section, such as declines in commodity prices, increases in basis differentials and inability to access markets, could reduce our profits and thus the cash we have to fulfill our financial obligations. If we are unable to satisfy our obligations with cash on hand, we could attempt to refinance such debt, sell assets or repay such debt with the proceeds from an equity offering. We cannot assure that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, to meet our lease obligations, or that future borrowings, equity financings or proceeds from the sale of assets will be available to pay or refinance such debt or obligations. The terms of our financing agreements may also prohibit us from taking such actions. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock, a refinancing of our debt or a sale of assets include financial market conditions and our market value and operating performance at the time of such offering or other financing. We cannot assure that any such proposed offering, refinancing or sale of assets can be successfully completed or, if completed, that the terms will be favorable to us.\nThe elimination of LIBOR may adversely affect the cost of our borrowings.\nRegulatory authorities in the U.K. ceased publication of certain LIBOR tenors after December 31, 2021 and will cease publication of all USD LIBOR tenors after June 30, 2023. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee has formally recommended forward-looking Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) term rates. We anticipate using a variation of the LIBOR rate until our credit agreement is extended. We do not expect the replacement of LIBOR to result in a material impact to\nour financial statements; however, negotiations with respect to financing agreements could require us to incur incremental expenses and may subject us to disputes over the appropriateness or comparability of the relevant replacement reference index. In addition, there can be no assurance that the application of SOFR or any other alternative reference rate will not increase our interest expense or will not introduce operational risks in our accounting or financial reporting and other aspects of our business.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulation\nClimate change legislation or regulations governing the emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduce demand for the natural gas, oil and NGLs we produce, and concern in financial and investment markets over greenhouse gasses and fossil fuel production could adversely affect our access to capital and the price of our common stock.\nIn response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to human health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their greenhouse gas emissions also will be required to meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards that will be established on a case-by-case basis. EPA rulemakings related to greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources.\nThe EPA also has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified onshore and offshore natural gas and oil production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. In June 2016, the EPA finalized regulations establishing NSPS, known as Subpart OOOOa, for methane and volatile organic compounds from new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities. In September 2020, the EPA finalized two sets of amendments to the 2016 Subpart OOOOa standards. The first, known as the 2020 Technical Rule, reduced the 2016 rule's fugitive emissions monitoring requirements and expanded exceptions to pneumatic pump requirements, among other changes. The second, known as the the 2020 Policy Rule, rescinded the methane-specific requirements for certain oil and natural gas sources in the production and processing segments. On January 20, 2021, the current administration issued an Executive Order directing the EPA to rescind the 2020 Technical Rule by September 2021 and consider revising the 2020 Policy Rule. On June 30, 2021, the current administration signed a Congressional Review Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) resolution passed by Congress that revoked the 2020 Policy Rule. The CRA resolution did not address the 2020 Technical Rule.\nFurther, on November 15, 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule intended to reduce methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas sources. The proposed rule would make the existing regulations in Subpart OOOOa more stringent and create a Subpart OOOOb to expand reduction requirements for new, modified, and reconstructed oil and gas sources, including standards focusing on certain source types that have never been regulated under the CAA (including intermittent vent pneumatic controllers, associated gas, and liquids unloading facilities). In addition, the proposed rule would establish \u201cEmissions Guidelines,\u201d creating a Subpart OOOOc that would require states to develop plans to reduce methane emissions from existing sources that must be at least as effective as presumptive standards set by the EPA. Under the proposed rule, states would have three years to develop their compliance plan for existing sources and the regulations for new sources would take effect immediately upon issuance of a final rule. The EPA is expected to issue both a supplemental proposed rule, that may expand or modify the current proposed rule, and final rule by the end of 2022. As a result of these regulatory changes, the scope of any final methane regulations or the costs for complying with federal methane regulations are uncertain.\nAlthough Congress from time to time has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the federal level in recent years. However, the United States House of Representatives passed H.R. 5376, known as the Build Back Better Act on November 3, 2021. The House version of the bill targets methane emissions from oil and gas sources by proposing to implement fees for excess methane leaking from wells, storage sites and pipelines as well as fees for new producing and non-producing oil and gas leases and off-shore pipelines. The United States Senate did not pass the House version of the Build Back Better Act, and it is unclear whether any portions of the bill will become law. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of states, including states in which we operate, have enacted or passed measures to track and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs. Most of these cap-and-trade programs require major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal is achieved. These reductions may cause the cost of allowances to escalate significantly over time.\nThe adoption and implementation of regulations that require reporting of greenhouse gases or otherwise limit emissions of greenhouse gases from our equipment and operations could require us to incur increased operating costs, including costs to monitor and report on greenhouse gas emissions, install new equipment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with\nour operations, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. In addition, these regulatory initiatives could drive down demand for our products, stimulating demand for alternative forms of energy that do not rely on combustion of fossil fuels that serve as a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While some new laws and regulations are prompting power producers to shift from coal to natural gas, which has a positive effect on demand, regulatory incentives or requirements to conserve energy, use alternative sources or reduce greenhouse gas emissions in product supply chains could reduce demand for the products we produce.\nIn December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016 after more than 70 nations, including the United States, ratified or otherwise indicated their intent to be bound by the agreement. In November 2019, the United States formally initiated the process for withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, which withdrawal became effective in November 2020. However, on January 20, 2021, the current administration issued written notification to the United Nations of the United States\u2019 intention to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which became effective on February 19, 2021. In addition, in September 2021, the current administration publicly announced the Global Methane Pledge, a pact that aims to reduce global methane emissions at least 30% below 2020 levels by 2030. Since its formal launch at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), over 100 countries have joined the pledge. To the extent that the United States and other countries implement or impose climate change regulations on the oil and natural gas industry, or that investors insist on compliance regardless of legal requirements, it could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe, our service providers and our customers are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities.\nOur development and production operations and the transportation of our products to market are subject to complex and stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing protection of the environment and natural resources, the occupational health and safety aspects of our operations, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the protection of certain plant and animal species. See \u201cOther - Environmental Regulation\u201d in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report for a description of the laws and regulations that affect us. These laws and regulations require us, our service providers and our customers to obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. Environmental regulations may restrict the types, quantities and concentration of materials that may be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit drilling or transportation activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, archeological sites and other protected areas, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations and those of our service providers and customers. Moreover, we or they may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, including as a result of government shutdowns, which may delay or interrupt our or their operations and limit our growth and revenues.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations can trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including investigatory actions, the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements, or the issuance of orders or judgments limiting or enjoining future operations. Strict liability or joint and several liability may be imposed under certain laws, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions. Moreover, our costs of compliance with existing laws could be substantial and may increase or unforeseen liabilities could be imposed if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. If we are not able to recover the increased costs through insurance or increased revenues, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Financial Markets and Uncertainties\nThe trading price and volume of our common stock may be volatile, and you could lose a significant portion of your investment.\nThe market price of the common stock could be volatile, and holders of common stock may not be able to resell their common stock at or above the price at which they acquired such securities due to fluctuations in the market price of common stock. The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the common stock. Specific factors that may have a significant effect on the market price for our common stock include:\n\u2022general economic conditions within the U.S. and internationally, including changes in interest rates;\n\u2022general market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices;\n\u2022domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022changes in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022volatility in the financial markets or other global economic factors, including the impact of COVID-19;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our and our competitors\u2019 quarterly and annual results;\n\u2022quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators;\n\u2022our business, operations, results and prospects;\n\u2022our operating and financial performance;\n\u2022future mergers and strategic alliances;\n\u2022market conditions in the energy industry;\n\u2022changes in government regulation, taxes, legal proceedings or other developments;\n\u2022shortfalls in our operating results from levels forecasted by securities analysts;\n\u2022investor sentiment toward the stock of oil and gas companies;\n\u2022changes in revenue or earnings estimates, or changes in recommendations by equity research analysts;\n\u2022failure to achieve the perceived benefits of the Mergers, including financial results and anticipated synergies, as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts;\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022the failure of research analysts to cover our stock;\n\u2022sales of common stock by us, large shareholders or management, or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u2022changes in accounting principles, policies, guidance, interpretations or standards;\n\u2022announcements concerning us or our competitors;\n\u2022public reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022strategic actions taken by competitors;\n\u2022actions taken by our shareholders;\n\u2022additions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022maintenance of acceptable credit ratings or credit quality; and\n\u2022the general state of the securities markets.\nAdditionally, we issued a substantial number of shares in connection with the Indigo Merger and the GEPH Merger. Certain restrictions on the resale by the holders such shares expire on March 1, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. If our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if the public perceives that such sales could occur, this could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.\nThese and other factors may impair the market for the common stock and the ability of investors to sell shares at an attractive price. These factors also could cause the market price and demand for the common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may negatively affect the price and liquidity of the common stock. Many of these factors and conditions are beyond our control.\nSecurities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nMarket views of our industry generally can affect our stock price, liquidity and ability to obtain financing.\nFactors described elsewhere, including views regarding future commodity prices, regulation and climate change, can affect the amount investors choose to invest in our industry generally. Recent years have seen a significant reduction in overall investment in exploration and production companies, resulting in a drop in individual companies\u2019 stock prices. Separate from actual and possible governmental action, certain financial institutions have announced policies to cease investing or to divest investments in companies, such as ours, that produce fossil fuels, and some banks have announced they no longer will lend to companies in this sector. To date these represent small fractions of overall sources of equity and debt, but that fraction could grow and thus affect our access to capital. Moreover, some equity investors are expressing concern over these matters and may prompt companies in our industry to adopt more costly practices even absent governmental action. Although we believe our\npractices result in low emission rates for methane and other greenhouse gases as compared to others in our industry, complying with investor sentiment may require modifications to our practices, which could increase our capital and operating expenses.\nVolatility in the financial markets or in global economic factors could adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nOur business may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in global financial markets. Included among these potential negative impacts are reduced energy demand and lower commodity prices, including due to the impact of COVID-19, increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers, reduced access to credit markets and the risks related to the discontinuation of LIBOR and other reference rates, including increased expenses and litigation and the effectiveness of interest rate hedge strategies. Our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing. If financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures.\nAny changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, resulting in \u201ctrade wars,\u201d in increased costs for materials necessary for our industry along with other goods imported into the United States, which may reduce customer demand for these products if the parties having to pay those tariffs increase their prices, or in trading partners limiting their trade with the United States. If these consequences are realized, the volume of economic activity in the United States, including growth in sectors that utilize our products, may be materially reduced along with a reduction in the potential export of our products. Such a reduction may materially and adversely affect commodity prices, our sales and our business.\nRisks Related to the Ability of our Hedging Activities to Adequately Manage our Exposure to Commodity and Financial Risk\nOur commodity price risk management and measurement systems and economic hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results.\nWe currently seek to hedge the price of a significant portion of our estimated production through swaps, collars, floors and other derivative instruments. The systems we use to quantify commodity price risk associated with our businesses might not always be effective. Further, such systems do not in themselves manage risk, particularly risks outside of our control, and adverse changes in energy commodity market prices, volatility, adverse correlation of commodity prices, the liquidity of markets, changes in interest rates and other risks discussed in this report might still adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and balance sheet under applicable accounting rules, even if risks have been identified. Furthermore, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. For example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract\u2019s counterparty credit or performance risk. Therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist.\nOur use of derivatives, through which we attempt to reduce the economic risk of our participation in commodity markets could result in increased volatility of our reported results. Changes in the fair values (gains and losses) of derivatives that qualify as hedges under GAAP to the extent that such hedges are not fully effective in offsetting changes to the value of the hedged commodity, as well as changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify or have not been designated as hedges under GAAP, must be recorded in our income. This creates the risk of volatility in earnings even if no economic impact to us has occurred during the applicable period. To the extent we cap or lock prices at specific levels, we would also forgo the ability to realize the higher revenues that would be realized should prices increase.\nThe impact of changes in market prices for natural gas, oil and NGLs on the average prices paid or received by us may be reduced based on the level of our hedging activities. These hedging arrangements may limit or enhance our margins if the market prices for oil, natural gas or NGLs were to change substantially from the price established by the hedges. In addition, our hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss if our production volumes are less than expected.\nThe implementation of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, including us, which participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC, the SEC, and other regulatory authorities to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. Although the CFTC has finalized most of its regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act, it continues to review and refine its initial rulemakings through additional interpretations and supplemental rulemakings. As a result, it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate effect of the rules and regulations on our business and while most of the regulations have been adopted, any new regulations or modifications to existing regulations may increase the cost of derivative contracts, limit the availability of derivatives to protect against risks that we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations thereunder, our results of\noperations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital investing.\nIn January 2020, the CFTC proposed new amended regulations that would place federal limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. These rules were finalized in January of 2021 with compliance dates as early as January 1, 2022 for certain positions. In 2016, the CFTC finalized a companion rule on aggregation of positions among entities under common ownership or control. It is too early to determine the precise effect of these rules on our business, but they may have an impact on our ability to hedge our exposure to certain enumerated commodities (whether using futures contracts, over-the-counter derivatives contracts or otherwise).\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and mandatory trading on designated contract markets or swap execution facilities. The CFTC may designate additional classes of swaps as subject to the mandatory clearing requirement in the future, but has not yet proposed rules designating any other classes of swaps, including physical commodity swaps, for mandatory clearing. The CFTC and prudential banking regulators also adopted mandatory margin requirements on uncleared swaps between swap dealers and certain other counterparties. The margin requirements are currently effective with respect to certain market participants and will be phased in over time with respect to other market participants, based on the level of an entity\u2019s swaps activity. We expect to qualify for and rely upon an end-user exception from the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements for swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks. We also should qualify for an exception from the uncleared swaps margin requirements. However, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements and the uncleared swaps margin requirement to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may adversely affect the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging.\nRisks Related to the Indigo Merger and the GEPH Merger\nWe may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the Indigo Merger and the GEPH Merger, and the Indigo Merger and the GEPH Merger may disrupt our current plans or operations.\nThe success of the Indigo Merger and the GEPH Merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our business and the businesses of Indigo and GEPH, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate such businesses or otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of the Indigo Merger and the GEPH Merger. Difficulties in integrating such businesses may result in the combined company performing differently than expected, in operational challenges, or in the failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include, among others:\n\u2022the inability to successfully integrate such businesses in a manner that permits the achievement of full revenue, expected cash flows and cost savings anticipated from the Indigo Merger and the GEPH Merger;\n\u2022not realizing anticipated operating synergies;\n\u2022integrating personnel from the two companies and the loss of key employees;\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses or delays;\n\u2022integrating relationships with customers, vendors and business partners;\n\u2022performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by integrating the operations of such businesses; and\n\u2022the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, our ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.", "PERMNO": 63765, "SIC": 4923, "TIC": "SWN"}
