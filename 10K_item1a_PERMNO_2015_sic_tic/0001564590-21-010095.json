{"cik": "1024795", "company": "HELIOS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nFACTORS INFLUENCING FUTURE RESULTS - FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, projections, our beliefs, and assumptions made by us, including (i) our strategies regarding growth, including our intention to develop new products and undertake acquisitions; (ii) our financing plans; (iii) trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations; (iv) our ability to continue to control costs and to meet our liquidity and other financing needs; (v) the declaration and payment of dividends; and (vi) our ability to respond to changes in customer demand domestically and internationally, including as a result of standardization. In addition, we may make other written or oral statements, which constitute forward-looking statements, from time to time. Words such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cseeks,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Similarly, statements that describe our future plans, objectives or goals also are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guaranteeing future performance and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report. Our actual results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. All forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nFactors that could cause actual results to differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (i) conditions in the capital markets, including the interest rate environment and the availability of capital; (ii) changes in the competitive marketplace that could affect our revenue and/or cost bases, such as increased competition, lack of qualified engineering, marketing, management or other personnel, and increased labor and raw materials costs; (iii) risks related to heath epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, including, without limitation, the current COVID-19 pandemic, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows; (iv) new product introductions, product sales mix and the geographic mix of sales nationally and internationally; and (v) the following risk factors:\nRisks Relating to Our Business: Global Regulatory and Economic Conditions\nGeneral global economic trends and industry trends may affect our sales. The capital goods industry in general, and our businesses, are subject to economic cycles, which directly affect customer orders, lead times and sales volume. Economic downturns generally have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, as they did in 2009. Cyclical economic expansions such as those of 2017 and 2018, provide a context where demand for capital goods is stimulated, creating higher incoming order rates for the products we produce. Higher demand can lead to part shortages which drive costs up. If demand gets too strong, lead times can be extended which may cause some customers to cancel orders. In the Electronics segment, our business is dependent on the general economy and widespread adoption of advanced digital control solutions that integrate technologies such as high-resolution displays, configurable software GPS navigation, vehicle management systems, engine safety diagnostics and engine energy efficiency. If one or more of these expected industry trends fails to occur, or occurs at a slower rate than expected, our sales growth will be negatively impacted, and our business will be adversely affected. In the future, continued weakening or improvement in the economy will directly affect orders and influence results of operations.\nOur business could be harmed by adverse global and regional economic and political conditions. In June 2016, voters in the UK approved the UK\u2019s exit (\u201cBrexit\u201d) from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and officially exited on January 31, 2020. A transition period ended on December 31, 2020, during which the UK and the EU negotiated the terms of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU going forward. Despite the implementation of the UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement beginning on January 1, 2021, it is still unclear how Brexit will ultimately impact relationships within the UK and between the UK and other countries on many aspects of fiscal policy, cross-border trade and international relations. The effects of and the perceptions as to the impact from the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU has affected and may continue to adversely affect business activity and economic and market conditions in the UK, EU and globally, and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the pound sterling and the euro. In addition, Brexit could lead to additional political, legal, and economic instability in the EU. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business in the UK, as well as our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. It is also unclear what long-term economic, financial, trade, and legal implications the withdrawal of the UK from the EU will have and how such withdrawal will affect our customers and our operations in the UK and EU. If the UK were to significantly alter its regulations affecting the manufacturing industry, we could face significant new costs. Any of the effects of Brexit could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Further, uncertainty still remains regarding the potential for the future imposition of tariffs on imports across EU borders. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur operations and transactions also depend upon favorable trade relations between the U.S. and those foreign countries in which our customers and suppliers have operations. A protectionist trade environment in either the U.S. or those foreign countries in which we do business or sell products, such as a change in the current tariff structures, export compliance laws, government subsidies, or other trade policies, may adversely affect our ability to economically source materials, sell our products, or do business in foreign markets. Trade restrictions, including withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements, negotiation of new trade agreements, including a possible new trade agreement with the UK, and imposition of new (and retaliatory) tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products, including developments in U.S.-China trade relations, could limit our ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair our ability to expand the business. These trade restrictions, and changes in, or uncertainty surrounding, global trade policies may affect our competitive position. Our overall success as a global business depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing economic, social and political conditions. We may not succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies to counter the foregoing factors effectively in each location where we do business and the foregoing factors may cause a reduction in our sales, profitability, or cash flows, or cause an increase in our liabilities.\nFailure to comply with laws, regulations and policies, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and UK Bribery Act or other applicable anti-corruption legislation, could result in fines, criminal penalties and an adverse effect on our business. We are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including anti-corruption laws, due to our global operations. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the UK Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies, their agents, consultants and other business partners from making improper payments to government officials or other persons (i.e., commercial bribery) for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other improper advantage. The laws also impose recordkeeping and internal control provisions on companies such as ours. We operate and/or conduct business, and any acquisition target may operate and/or conduct business, in some parts of the world, such as China, India and Russia, that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in such countries, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot provide assurance that our or any acquisition target\u2019s internal control policies and procedures have protected us, or will protect us, from unlawful conduct of our employees, agents, consultants and other business partners. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that violations of anti-corruption laws may have occurred, we may be required to investigate and/or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. Violation may result in substantial civil and/or criminal fines, disgorgement of profits, sanctions and penalties, debarment from future work with governments, curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and imprisonment of the individuals involved. As a result, any such violations may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business. Any of these impacts could have a material, adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business is subject to a variety of governmental regulations that may restrict our business and may result in costs and penalties. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to foreign business practices, labor and employment, construction, land use, and taxation, among others. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including assessment of monetary penalties and the imposition of corrective requirements. From time to time, as part of the regular overall evaluation of our operations, including newly acquired operations, we may be subject to compliance audits by regulatory authorities. In addition, any failure to comply with regulations related to the government procurement process at the federal, state or local level, or restrictions on political activities and lobbying may result in administrative or financial penalties including being barred from providing services to governmental entities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur operations expose us to risks of non-compliance with numerous countries\u2019 import and export laws and regulations. Due to our significant foreign sales, we are subject to trade and import and export regulations in multiple jurisdictions, including the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control\u2019s regulations. As a result, compliance with multiple trade sanctions and embargoes and import and export laws and regulations pose a constant challenge and risk to us. Furthermore, the laws and regulations concerning import activity, export recordkeeping and reporting, export control and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory trading obligations could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from governmental contracts, seizure of shipments, loss of import and export privileges, reputational damage and a reduction in the value of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Business: Environmental, Health & Safety\nWe face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. We face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, including the global outbreak of COVID-19. The continued spread of COVID-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of capital and adversely impacts access to capital. If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations will likely be impacted. We may be unable to perform fully on our contracts and our costs may increase as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. These cost increases may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance.\nIt is possible that the continued spread of COVID-19 could also cause further disruption in our supply chain; cause delay, or limit the ability of customers to perform, including in making timely payments to us; impact investment performance; and cause other unpredictable events.\nWe continue to work with our stakeholders (including customers, employees, suppliers and local communities) to responsibly address this global pandemic. We continue to monitor the situation to assess further possible implications to our business, supply chain and customers, and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences.\nAs a result of current economic conditions and expected future impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, the carrying value of goodwill with respect to certain of our assets was impaired, resulting in impairment charges that negatively impacted our results of operations. We may be required to record additional impairment charges in the future if the COVID-19 pandemic continues. We cannot predict the amount and timing of any such additional charges, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe cannot at this time predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and we may face significant costs or liabilities associated with environmental, health and safety matters. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things: the discharge of pollutants into the soil, air and water; the generation, storage, handling, use, release, disposal and transportation of hazardous materials and wastes; environmental cleanup; and the health and safety of our employees. Environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations continue to evolve, and we may become subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly related to air quality and water quality, which could require us to make changes to our operations or incur significant costs relating to compliance. We are also required to obtain and maintain environmental, health and safety permits and approvals for our facilities and operations. In addition, the potential impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain. Although the financial impact of these potential changes is not reasonably estimable at this time, our operations in certain locations and those of our customers and suppliers could potentially be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our sales, profitability and cash flows. Our failure to comply with such laws, regulations, permits and approvals could subject us to increased employee healthcare and workers\u2019 compensation costs, liabilities, fines and other penalties or compliance costs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business: Growth Strategy\nWe are subject to various risks relating to our growth strategy. In pursuing our growth strategy, we intend to expand our presence in existing markets, enter new markets and pursue acquisitions and joint ventures to complement our business. Many of the expenses arising from expansion efforts may have a negative effect on operating results until such time, if at all, that these expenses are offset by increased revenues. We cannot assure that we will be able to improve our market share or profitability, recover our expenditures or successfully implement our growth strategy.\nThe expansion strategy also may require substantial capital investment for the construction of new facilities and their effective operation. We can give no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nWe may fail to successfully acquire or integrate companies that provide complementary products or technologies. A key component of our growth strategy and financial goals depends upon our ability to successfully identify and integrate acquisition targets that complement our existing products and services. Such a strategy involves the potential risks inherent in assessing the value, strengths, weaknesses, contingent or other liabilities, and potential profitability of acquisition candidates, as well as integrating the operations of acquired companies. In addition, any acquisitions of businesses with foreign operations or sales may increase our exposure to risks inherent in doing business outside the U.S. From time to time, we may have acquisition discussions with potential target companies both domestically and internationally. Any acquisition may or may not occur and, if an acquisition does occur, it may not be successful in enhancing our business for one or more of the following reasons:\n\u2022\nAny business acquired may not be integrated successfully and may not prove profitable;\n\u2022\nThe price we pay for any business acquired may overstate the value of that business or otherwise be too high;\n\u2022\nLiabilities we take on through the acquisition may prove to be higher than we expected;\n\u2022\nImpairment of relationships with employees and customers of the business acquired, as a result of the change in ownership;\n\u2022\nWe may fail to achieve acquisition synergies; or\n\u2022\nThe focus on the integration of operations of acquired entities may divert management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operation of our businesses.\nInherent in any future acquisition is the risk of transitioning company cultures and facilities. The failure to efficiently and effectively achieve such transitions could increase our costs and decrease our profitability.\nWe also may incur significant costs such as transaction fees, professional service fees and other costs related to future acquisitions, as well as integration costs following the completion of any such acquisitions. Although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of any acquired businesses will offset the incremental transaction and acquisition-related costs over time, this net financial benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nWe are subject to intense competition. Our products in both the Hydraulics and Electronics segments currently, and will continue to, face significant competition, both from other companies and from incumbent technologies. In the case of our Hydraulics segment, some of our competitors are full-line hydraulic system producers and others are niche suppliers like us. In the case of our Electronics segment, our competitors include companies that have substantially longer operating histories, larger customer bases, name recognition, and financial and marketing resources than we do. Our competitors also include companies that have emerged in low cost production areas such as Asia and Eastern Europe with look-alike products. We believe that we compete with our competitors based upon quality, reliability, price, value, speed of delivery and technological characteristics. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be able to compete effectively with these companies.\nCurrently, certain of our customers purchase parts or products from us to meet a specific need in a system that cannot be filled by a component that they make themselves. However, given their superior technological capabilities and financial resources, our competitors could be engaged in the internal development of products and technologies that are similar to, or may compete with, certain of our products and technologies.\nThe future prospects for our products are dependent upon our customers\u2019 acceptance of our products as an alternative to their internally developed products. Future sales prospects also are dependent upon acceptance of third-party sourcing for products as an alternative to in-house development. In the future, customers may continue to use internally developed components. They also may decide to develop or acquire products that are similar to, or that may be substituted for, our products.\nWe also sell products into competitive markets. Within our primary markets, we compete with a range of companies that offer certain individual components of our full system solutions. Particularly within our Electronics segment, the components of our overall systems most commonly include displays, panels, sensors, valves, and other end-devices. If our customers fail to accept our full system products or seek to internally develop alternatives to our full system products using component parts sourced from our competitors, or if we are otherwise unable to develop or maintain strong relationships with our customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nCompetitive actions, such as price reductions, consolidation in the industry, improved delivery and other actions, could adversely affect our revenue and earnings. We could experience a material adverse effect to the extent that our competitors are successful in reducing our customers\u2019 purchases of products and services from us. Competition could also cause us to lower our prices, which could reduce our margins and profitability.\nRisks Relating to Our Business: Operations\nIf we are unable to continue our technological innovation and successful introduction of new commercial products in an efficient, cost-effective manner, our business will be adversely affected. Our business involves a significant level of product development activities, generally in connection with our customers\u2019 development activities. Industry standards, customer expectations or other products may emerge that could render one or more of our products or services less desirable or obsolete. Maintaining our market position requires continued investment in research and development, particularly in the Electronics segment, which experiences ongoing technological change and product improvement. Our future growth will depend on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in our markets, as well as our ability to acquire new product technologies or to fund and successfully develop, manufacture and market products in this constantly changing environment. During an economic downturn or a subsequent recovery, we may need to maintain our investment in research and development, which may limit our ability to reduce these expenses in proportion to a sales shortfall. In addition, increased investments in research and development may divert resources from other potential investments in our business, such as acquisitions or investments in our facilities, processes and operations. If these activities are not as successful as currently anticipated, are not completed on a timely basis, or are more costly than currently anticipated, or if we are not able to produce newly developed products at a cost that meets the anticipated product cost structure, then our future sales, margins and/or earnings could be lower than expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, if we fail to keep pace with evolving technological innovations in the markets we serve, our business will be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to fluctuations in the prices of parts and raw materials, and dependent on our suppliers of these parts. We are dependent upon suppliers for parts and raw materials used in the manufacture of components that we sell to our customers, and some of our raw material costs are subject to commodity market price fluctuations. We may experience an increase in costs for parts or raw materials that we source from our suppliers, or we may experience a shortage of parts or raw materials for various reasons, such as the loss of a significant supplier, high overall demand creating shortages in parts and supplies we use, financial distress, work stoppages, natural disasters, fluctuations in commodity prices or production difficulties that may affect one or more of our suppliers. In particular, current or future global economic uncertainty may affect our key suppliers in terms of their operating cash flow and access to financing. This may, in turn, affect their ability to perform their obligations to us. In addition, quality and sourcing issues that our suppliers may experience can also adversely affect the quality and effectiveness of our products and services and may result in liability or reputational harm to us. Our customers rely on us to provide on-time delivery and have certain rights if our delivery standards are not maintained. A significant increase in our supply costs, including for raw materials that are subject to commodity price fluctuations, or a protracted interruption of supplies for any reason, could result in the delay of one or more of our customer contracts, or could damage our reputation and relationships with our customers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnforeseen or recurring operational problems at any of our facilities, or other catastrophic loss of one of our key manufacturing facilities, may cause significant lost production and adversely affect our results of operations. Our manufacturing process could be affected by operational problems that could impair our production capability. Many of our manufacturing facilities contain high cost and sophisticated machines that are used in our manufacturing processes. Disruptions or shutdowns at any of our facilities could be caused by:\n\u2022\nmaintenance outages to conduct maintenance activities that cannot be performed safely during operations;\n\u2022\nprolonged power failures or reductions;\n\u2022\nbreakdown, failure or substandard performance of any of our machines or other equipment;\n\u2022\nnoncompliance with, and liabilities related to, environmental requirements or permits;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including railroad tracks, bridges, tunnels or roads;\n\u2022\nfires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, microbursts or other catastrophic disasters, national emergencies, political unrest, war or terrorist activities; or\n\u2022\nother operational problems.\nIf some of our facilities are shut down, they may experience prolonged startup periods, regardless of the reason for the shutdown. Those startup periods could range from several days to several weeks or longer, depending on the reason for the shutdown and other factors. Any prolonged disruption in operations at any of our facilities could cause a significant loss of production and adversely affect our results of operations and negatively impact our customers and dealers.\nWe currently have operations located in geographies susceptible to severe weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and tornadoes. A catastrophic event, whether resulting from severe weather or otherwise, could result in the loss of the use of all or a portion of one of our manufacturing facilities. Although we carry property and business interruption insurance, our coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur. Any of these events individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nA disruption in our supply chain or other factors impacting the distribution of our products could adversely affect our business. A disruption within our logistics or supply chain network at any of the freight companies that deliver components for our manufacturing operations or ship our fully-assembled products to our customers could adversely affect our business and result in lost sales or harm to our reputation. Our supply chain is dependent on third-party ocean-going container ships, rail, barge and trucking systems and, therefore, disruption in these logistics services because of weather-related problems, strikes, bankruptcies or other events could adversely affect our financial performance and financial condition, negatively impacting sales, profitability and cash flows. Additionally, we rely on supplied labor through a third-party provider to support key operations in Mexico. A disruption in the ability of this provider to deliver qualified personnel and to operate our facility in Mexico could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Relating to Our Business: Financial\nWe may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. We may require additional capital in the future to:\n\u2022\nfund our operations;\n\u2022\nfinance investments in equipment and infrastructure needed to maintain and expand our manufacturing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022\nenhance and expand the range of products we offer; and\n\u2022\nrespond to potential strategic opportunities, such as investments, acquisitions, and international expansion.\nWe can give no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. The terms of available financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be forced to reduce our operations or to delay, limit or abandon expansion opportunities. Moreover, even if we are able to continue our operations, the failure to obtain additional financing could reduce our competitiveness. Our senior credit facility limits our ability to incur additional debt and therefore we likely would have to issue additional equity to raise additional capital. If we issue additional equity, a shareholder\u2019s interest in us will be diluted.\nOur existing indebtedness could adversely affect our business and growth prospects. As of January 2, 2021, we had total indebtedness of approximately $462 million. Our indebtedness, or any additional indebtedness we may incur, could require us to divert funds identified for other purposes for debt service and impair our liquidity position. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we would be able to take any of these actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us or at all.\nOur indebtedness, the cash flow needed to satisfy our debt and the covenants contained in our senior credit facility have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting funds otherwise available for financing our capital expenditures by requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to those of our competitors that are less indebted than we are;\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to rising interest rates; and\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business.\nMore specifically, under the terms of our senior credit facility, we have agreed to certain financial covenants. In addition, our senior credit facility places limitations on our ability to acquire other companies. Any failure by us to comply with the financial or other covenants set forth in our senior credit facility in the future, if not cured or waived, could result in our senior lender accelerating the maturity of our indebtedness or preventing us from accessing availability under our senior credit facility. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash resources to satisfy our debt obligations and we may not be able to continue our operations as planned.\nIf our long-lived assets, goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record significant non-cash charges to our earnings. We recognize impairments of goodwill when the fair value of any of our reporting units becomes less than its carrying value. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions about future cash flows of each reporting unit, discount rates applied to these cash flows and current market estimates of value. Based on the uncertainty of future revenue growth rates and other assumptions used to estimate our reporting units\u2019 fair value, future reductions in our expected cash flows could cause material non-cash impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We also have certain long-lived assets and other intangible assets which could be at risk of impairment or may require reserves based upon anticipated future benefits to be derived from such assets. Any change in the valuation of such assets could have a material effect on our profitability.\nFluctuations in exchange rates may affect our operating results and impact our financial condition. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar may increase or decrease our sales or earnings. Because our consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, when we generate sales or earnings in other currencies, or we pay expenses in other currencies, the translation of those results into U.S. dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the reported amount of those sales or earnings. If the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the value of the local currency, we may be less competitive. In addition, our debt service requirements are predominantly in U.S. dollars and a portion of our cash flow is generated in British pounds, euros and other foreign currencies. Significant changes in the value of the foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could impair our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. For purposes of accounting, the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, where the local currency is the functional currency, are translated using period-end exchange rates, and the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated using average exchange rates during each period.\nIn addition to currency translation risks, we incur currency transaction risk whenever we enter into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency other than U.S. dollars. Given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be able to effectively manage our currency or translation risks. Volatility in currency exchange rates may decrease our sales and profitability and impair our financial condition. We periodically evaluate our need to hedge our exposures to foreign currencies and enter into forward foreign exchange contracts as we deem necessary.\nChanges in tax rates, laws or regulations and the resolution of tax disputes could adversely impact our financial results. As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine our consolidated income tax provision and related liabilities. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate, cash flows and operating results could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, as well as by changes in the local tax laws and regulations, or the interpretations thereof. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d) was signed into law. The TCJA made comprehensive changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, including lowering the statutory rate and moving from a global to a modified territorial tax regime. As the U.S. Department of Treasury and the IRS continue to issue regulations interpreting the implications of the TCJA, we continue to examine the impact that this tax reform legislation may have on our business. In addition, the Company\u2019s tax returns are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities. While we believe our tax provisions are appropriate, the final outcome of tax audits or disputes could result in adjustments to the Company\u2019s tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nRisks Relating to Our Business: Intellectual Property\nThe inability to protect our intellectual property could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage and reduce our sales and profitability, and the cost of protecting our intellectual property may be significant. We have obtained and applied for some U.S. and foreign trademark and patent registrations and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and patents, as appropriate. We cannot guarantee that any of our pending patent and trademark applications will be approved. Moreover, even if the applications are approved, third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge them. An inability to obtain registrations in the U.S. or elsewhere could limit our ability to protect our trademarks and technologies and could impede our business. Further, the protection of our intellectual property rights may require expensive investment in protracted litigation and substantial management time, and there is no assurance we ultimately would prevail or that a successful outcome would lead to an economic benefit that is greater than the investment in the litigation. In the Electronics segment, the patents in our portfolio are scheduled to expire at various dates through 2038. In the Hydraulics segment, the patents in our portfolio are schedule to expire at various dates through 2040.\nWe may also face difficulties protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign countries. The laws of foreign countries in which our products are sold or manufactured may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. For example, we are increasing our technical capabilities and sales in China, where laws may not afford the same intellectual property protections.\nIf we are alleged to have infringed upon the intellectual property rights owned by others, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Competitors or other third parties may allege that we, or consultants or other third parties retained or indemnified by us, infringe on their intellectual property rights. We also may face allegations that our employees have misappropriated intellectual property rights of their former employers or other third parties. From time to time, we receive notices from other companies that allege we may be infringing certain of their patents or other rights. If we are unable to resolve these matters satisfactorily, or to obtain licenses on acceptable terms, we may face litigation. Given the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property-related litigation, the assertion of an infringement claim against us may cause us to spend significant amounts to defend the claim (even if we ultimately prevail), pay significant money damages, lose significant revenues, be prohibited from using the relevant technologies or other intellectual property rights, cease offering certain products or services, or incur significant license royalty, or technology development expenses. Even in instances where we believe that claims and allegations of intellectual property infringement against us are without merit, defending against such claims is time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of time and attention of our management and employees. In addition, although in some cases a third party may have agreed to indemnify us for such costs, such indemnifying party may refuse or be unable to uphold its contractual obligations.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed. We maintain trade secrets, confidential, and proprietary information in the course and scope of our business. In the Electronics segment particularly, we rely significantly on trade secrets such as unpatented software algorithms, know-how, technology and other proprietary information to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect software algorithms through encryption mechanisms in the distribution of our binary files used in programming our engine control products. However, we cannot guarantee that these encryption techniques can protect all or any portion of these binary files. In practice, we seek to protect our trade secrets by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. The agreements obligate them to assign to us any inventions developed in the course of their work for us. However, we cannot guarantee that we have executed these agreements with each party that may have or has had access to our trade secrets or that the agreements we have executed will provide adequate protection. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. As a result, we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they bring against us, to determine ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Monitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult and we do not know whether the procedures we have followed to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the U.S. may be less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur use of open source software may expose us to additional risks. We use open source software in our business, including in some of our products. While we try to monitor all use of open source software in our business to ensure that no open source software is used in such a way as to require us to disclose the source code to critical or fundamental elements of our software or technology, we cannot be certain that such use may not have inadvertently occurred in deploying our solutions. Furthermore, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts. As a result, there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. The risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated and could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business: Other\nWe are subject to risks relating to international sales. International sales represent a significant proportion of our consolidated sales. Approximately 62% and 59% of our net sales were outside of the U.S. during 2020 and 2019, respectively. We will continue to expand the scope of operations outside the U.S., both through direct investment and distribution, and expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial portion of net sales in future periods.\nOur future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate, including civil uprisings and terrorist acts;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nimport and export controls;\n\u2022\npotentially negative consequences from changes in U.S. and international tax laws;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and the value of the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022\nexchange controls and currency restrictions;\n\u2022\nexpropriation of property without fair compensation;\n\u2022\ngovernmental actions that result in the deprivation of contract or proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nthe acceptance of business practices that are not consistent with or are antithetical to prevailing business practices we are accustomed to in the U.S., including bribery and corruption;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing geographically widespread operations;\n\u2022\nthe unionization of, or increased union activity, such as strikes or work stoppages, with respect to, our workforce outside the U.S.;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor regulations;\n\u2022\nglobal and/or regional pandemics;\n\u2022\nrequirements relating to withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory regimes controlling the protection of our intellectual property;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in enforcement of contractual obligations under non-U.S. law;\n\u2022\nrefusal or inability of foreign banks to make payment on letters of credit in connection with foreign sales, and our inability to collect from our foreign customers in such circumstances;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to own or operate subsidiaries, repatriate dividends or earnings from our foreign subsidiaries, or to make investments or acquire new businesses in these jurisdictions; and\n\u2022\nthe burden of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws.\nOur international operations and sales also expose us to different local political, regulatory and business risks and challenges. For example, we are faced with potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations and we have to design local solutions to manage credit and legal risks of local customers and channel partners, which may not be effective. In addition, because some of our international sales are to suppliers that perform work for foreign governments, we are subject to the political and legal risks associated with foreign government projects. For example, certain foreign governments may require suppliers for a project to obtain products solely from local manufacturers or may prohibit the use of products manufactured in certain countries.\nInternational growth and expansion into markets such as Europe, Asia and Latin America may cause us difficulty due to greater regulatory barriers than in the U.S., the necessity of adapting to new regulatory systems, problems related to entering new markets with different economic, social and political systems and conditions, and significant competition from the primary participants in these markets, some of which may have substantially greater resources and political influence than we do. For example, unstable political conditions or civil unrest could negatively impact our order levels and sales in a region or our ability to collect receivables from customers or operate or execute projects in a region.\nWe are dependent upon key individuals and skilled personnel. Our success depends, to some extent, upon a number of key individuals. The loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. Future operating results depend to a significant degree upon the continued contribution of key management, technical personnel and the skilled labor force. As the Company continues to expand internationally, additional management and other key personnel will be needed. Competition for management and engineering personnel is intense, and other employers may have greater financial and other resources to attract and retain these employees. We conduct a substantial part of our operations in Sarasota, Florida; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Rivolta D\u2019adda, Italy; various locations across Australia; Costa Mesa, California and Baja, Mexico. Our continued success is dependent on our ability to attract and retain a skilled labor force at these locations. There are no assurances that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel required to develop, manufacture and market our products and expand our operations.\nIncreased IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions and services. We are dependent on various information technologies throughout our Company to administer, store and support multiple business activities. Increased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes, and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness, and results of operations.\nDue to the nature of our business and products, we may be liable for damages based on product liability and other tort and warranty claims. We face an inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event that the failure, use or misuse of our products results, or is alleged to result, in death, bodily injury, property damage, or economic loss. In the past, we have been subject to product liability claims relating to our products, and we may be subject to additional product liability claims in the future for both past and current products.\nAlthough we currently maintain product liability coverage, which we believe to be adequate for the continued operation of our business, such insurance may become difficult or impossible to obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us. Moreover, our insurance coverage includes customary exclusions and conditions, may not cover certain specialized applications and generally does not cover warranty or recall claims. A successful product liability claim or series of claims against us, including one or more consumer claims purporting to constitute class actions or claims resulting from extraordinary loss events, in excess of or outside our insurance coverage, or a significant warranty claim or series of claims against us, could materially decrease our liquidity, impair our financial condition and adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, regardless of the outcome, product liability claims can be expensive to defend, divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time and cause reputational damage.\nWe are subject to a variety of claims, investigations and litigation that could adversely affect our results of operations and harm our reputation. In the normal course of our business, we are subject to claims and lawsuits, including from time to time claims for damages related to product liability and warranties, investigations by governmental agencies, litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights and litigation related to employee matters and commercial disputes. Defending these lawsuits and becoming involved in these investigations may divert our management\u2019s attention, and may cause us to incur significant expenses, even if there is no evidence that our systems or components were the cause of the claim. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards, penalties or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures.\nWe are subject to risks related to sustainability, corporate social responsibility and reputation. Many factors influence our reputation and the value of our brands including the perception held by our customers, business partners, investors, other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business. Our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance activities and disclosures and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as environmental stewardship, supply chain management, climate change, diversity and inclusion, workplace conduct, human rights, philanthropy and support for local communities. Any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, how governments act to mitigate climate and related environmental risks, as well as associated changes in the behavior and preferences of businesses and consumers, could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Changes in climate and related environmental risks, perceptions of them, and governmental responses to them, may also occur more rapidly than we are able to adapt without disrupting our business and impairing our financial results.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market or the issuance of securities senior to our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings. Sales by us or our shareholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or could impair our ability to raise capital through a future sale of, or pay for acquisitions using, our equity securities.\nWe may issue common stock or equity securities senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy, as consideration in acquisitions or for other reasons. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales or issuances of shares of our common stock or other equity securities, or the availability of shares of our common stock or any other equity securities for future sale or issuance, will have on the trading price of our common stock.\nAdditional issuances of equity securities would dilute the ownership of existing shareholders and could reduce our earnings per share. We may issue equity securities in the future in connection with capital raising activities, acquisitions, strategic transactions or for other purposes. To the extent we issue additional equity securities, the ownership of our existing shareholders would be diluted and our earnings per share could be reduced.\nWe may not pay dividends on our common stock. Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments and as permitted by our debt agreements. Although historically we have paid a continuous quarterly dividend and a periodic special dividend, we are not required to declare cash dividends on our common stock, and the payment of future quarterly and special dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors. In determining the amount of any future quarterly or special dividends, our board of directors will consider economic and market conditions, our financial condition and operating results. Any change in our historical dividend practice could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. If our board of directors decides not to pay dividends in the future, then a return on investment in our common stock will only occur if our stock price appreciates.", "PERMNO": 84438, "SIC": 3490, "TIC": "HLIO"}
