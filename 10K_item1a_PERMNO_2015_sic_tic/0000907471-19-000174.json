{"cik": "907471", "company": "META FINANCIAL GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-11-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are subject to various risks, including those described below that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected or historical results. Our business could be harmed, perhaps materially, by any of these risks, as well as other risks that we have not identified, whether due to such risks not presently being known to us, because we do not currently believe such risks to be material, or otherwise. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and actual results and events may differ substantially from those discussed or highlighted in these forward-looking statements. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the Company\u2019s financial statements and related notes. Before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities, you should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. See also \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Business\nOur framework for managing risk, including our underwriting practices, may not prevent future losses.\nWe have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies, as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. For example, if our underwriting practices or criteria fail to adequately identify, price, and mitigate credit risks, such as the risk in our tax refund advance loan portfolio that the IRS or the relevant state revenue department does not pay our customer's tax refund in full or the risk that any of our EROs will facilitate or engage in malfeasance or offer the Bank's products and services in a manner that does not comply with applicable law or contractual representations, warranties and covenants, it is possible that losses in our loan portfolio will exceed the amounts the Bank has set aside for loss reserves and result in reduced interest income and increased provision for loan losses, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Any resulting deterioration in our loan portfolio could also cause a decrease in our capital, which would make it more difficult to maintain regulatory capital compliance. Further, risk mitigation techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specific circumstances and timing of such outcomes, which may result in the Bank or any of its divisions incurring unexpected losses.\nWe are subject to credit risk in connection with our lending and leasing activities, and our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted by factors that adversely affect our borrowers.\nWe, through the Bank and its divisions, originate various types of loans and leases, and our financial condition and results of operations are affected by the ability of borrowers to repay their loans or leases in a timely manner. Borrowers may be unable to repay their loans due to various factors, some of which are outside of their control. For example, the ability of borrowers to repay their agricultural loans with the Bank depends upon the successful operation of the borrower's business, which is greatly dependent upon factors such as the weather, commodity prices, and interest rates, among others. Similarly, borrowers under our commercial loans and related financing products (typically, small- to medium-sized businesses) may be may be more susceptible to even mild or moderate economic declines than larger commercial borrowers, which may subject the Bank and, ultimately, us, to a higher risk of loan loss. The risk of non-payment by borrowers is assessed through our underwriting processes and other risk management practices, which may not be able to fully identify, price and mitigate such risk. See \"Our framework for managing risk, including our underwriting practices, may not prevent future losses.\" Despite those efforts, we do and will experience loan and lease losses, and our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected by those loan and lease losses.\nIf our actual loan and lease losses exceed our allowance for loan and lease losses, our net income will decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and subjective judgments about the collectability of our loan and lease portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of our loans and leases, which are subject to change. Despite our underwriting and monitoring practices, our loan and lease customers may not repay their loans and leases according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans and leases may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan and lease balance. We may experience significant loan and lease losses due to nonpayment by our borrowers, which could have a material adverse effect on our overall financial condition and results of operation, as well as the value of our common stock. Because we must use assumptions to establish our allowance for loan and lease losses, the current allowance for loan and lease losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan and lease losses, and increases in the allowance, which may be significant, may be necessary. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or recognize loan charge-offs. Material additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income. We cannot provide any assurance that our monitoring procedures and policies will reduce certain lending risks or that our allowance for loan and lease losses will be adequate to cover actual losses. Further, a new method of determining loan and lease loss allowances, expected to be effective for the Company on October 1, 2020, is under analysis and could impact future profitability. See Note 1 to the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d which is included in Part II, Item 8 \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further details on this accounting pronouncement.\nAgreements with Marketers, whereby the Bank will originate and hold unsecured consumer loans, may result in increased exposure to credit risk and fraud and may present certain additional risks.\nAlthough the Bank has historically offered unsecured consumer loans to its customers through its brick-and-mortar branch network, the Bank's entry into program agreements with other third parties to market and service loans originated by the Bank represents a new area of the consumer credit market for the Bank, which presents potential increased credit, operational, and reputational risks. Because the loans originated under such programs are unsecured, in the event a borrower does not repay the loan in accordance with its terms or otherwise defaults on the loan, the Bank may not be able to recover from the borrower an amount sufficient to pay any remaining balance on the loan. See \"If our actual loan and lease losses exceed our allowance for loan and lease losses, our net income will decrease.\" We may also become subject to claims by regulatory agencies, customers, or other third parties due to the conduct of the third parties with which the Bank operates such lending programs if such conduct is deemed to not comply with applicable laws in connection with the marketing and servicing of loans originated pursuant to these programs.\nOur investments in certain tax-advantaged projects may not generate returns as anticipated and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe invest in certain tax-advantaged investments that support renewable energy resources. Our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return in part through the realization of federal and state income tax credits, and other tax benefits, over specified time periods. We are subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits, which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level, may fail to meet certain government compliance requirements and may not be able to be realized. For example, as previously disclosed, we previously recognized $7.9 million of investment tax credits between fiscal year 2017 and 2018 associated with the MSGs subject to the transactions with the DC Solar entities. We are aware that the DC Solar entities, including their principals, are subjects of ongoing federal investigations involving allegations of fraudulent misconduct. While we continue to gather information about the situation, there can be no assurances that such tax credits will not be subject to recapture in the future. See Note 2. Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information regarding the transactions with these DC Solar entities and related matters.\nThe risk of not being able to realize, or of subsequently incurring a recapture of, the tax credits and other tax benefits depends on various factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in the applicable tax code, as well as the continued economic viability of the project and project operator. Further, while we engage in due diligence review both prior to the initial investment and on an ongoing basis, our due diligence review may not identify relevant issues or risks that may adversely impact our ability to realize these tax credits or other tax benefits. The possible inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits may have a negative impact on our financial results.\nThe purchased student loan portfolios present risks to the Bank.\nThe Bank purchased two separate student loan portfolios, which were insured by ReliaMax Surety Company (\"RSC\") at the time the portfolios were purchased. In June 2018, RSC was placed into liquidation by the South Dakota Division of Insurance, as a result of which the Bank's purchased student loan portfolios are no longer insured. We cannot provide any assurances as to whether or to what extent we will be able to recover all or any portion of unearned premiums relating to these loan portfolios, whether as a result of the RSC liquidation plan, the New York Property/Casualty Insurance Security Fund, or otherwise. If our recovery of unearned premiums is less than expected (including if we do not recover any such amounts at all), we may recognize loan losses in the future in excess of our estimates, which may adversely affect our realized pre-tax yields on the Bank's purchased student loan portfolios and may otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThrough our Crestmark division, we engage in equipment leasing activities; the residual value of leased equipment at the time of its disposition may be less than forecasted at the time we entered into the lease.\nThe market value of any given piece of leased equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold due to various factors, including factors beyond our control. The market value of used leased equipment depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe market price for new equipment that is similar;\n\u2022\nthe age and condition of the leased equipment at the time it is sold;\n\u2022\nthe supply of and demand for similar used equipment on the market;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances relating to the leased equipment or similar equipment; and\n\u2022\neconomic conditions in the specific business or industry in which the equipment is used, as well as broader regional or national economic conditions.\nWe include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of leased equipment sold. Changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense, as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of leased equipment. If we sell our used leased equipment at prices significantly below our projections or in lesser quantities than we anticipated at the time we entered into the lease, our results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur earnings depend substantially on our interest rate spread, which is the difference between (i) the rates we earn on loans, securities, and other earning assets, and (ii) the interest rates we pay on deposits and other borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. As market interest rates rise, we experience competitive pressures to increase the rates we pay on deposits, especially at our community bank, which may decrease our net interest income. Conversely, if interest rates fall, yields on loans and investments may fall. The Bank monitors its interest rate risk exposure; however, the Bank can provide no assurance that its efforts will appropriately protect the Bank in the future from interest rate risk exposure. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\"\nWe operate in an extremely competitive market, and our business will suffer if we are unable to compete effectively.\nWe encounter significant competition in all of our market areas from other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market mutual funds and other financial intermediaries. Some of our and the Bank's competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits and may offer services that we do not or cannot provide. Our profitability depends upon both our ability to compete successfully in our market areas and the Bank's and the divisions' ability to compete in their various business markets.\nFor example, the Crestmark division competes for loans, leases, and other financial services with numerous national and regional banks, thrifts, credit unions, and other financial institutions, as well as other entities that provide financial services, including specialty lenders, securities firms, and mutual funds. Certain larger commercial financing companies do not currently focus their marketing efforts on smaller commercial companies; however, any shift in focus by such larger financing companies may further fragment existing market share in this commercial finance industry. Moreover, some of the financial institutions and financial service organizations with which the Crestmark division competes are not subject to the same degree of regulation as the Crestmark division and the Bank. Many of the Crestmark division's competitors have been in business for many years, have established customer bases, are larger, offer larger branch networks than the Bank does, and may offer other services that neither the Crestmark division nor the Bank do.\nSeveral banking institutions have adopted business strategies similar to ours, particularly with respect to the MPS division. This competition, and competition in any of the Bank's other divisions, may increase our costs, reduce our revenues or revenue growth, or make it difficult for us to compete effectively in obtaining additional customer relationships.\nOur business could suffer if there is a decline in the use of prepaid cards or there are adverse developments with respect to the prepaid financial services industry in general.\nAs the prepaid financial services industry evolves, consumers may find prepaid financial services to be less attractive than other financial services. Consumers might not use prepaid financial services for any number of reasons. For example, negative publicity surrounding us or other prepaid financial service providers could impact MPS's business and prospects for growth to the extent it adversely impacts the perception of prepaid financial services. If consumers do not continue or increase their usage of prepaid cards, MPS's operating revenues may remain at current levels or decline. Growth of prepaid financial services as an electronic payment mechanism may not occur or may occur more slowly than estimated. If there is a shift in the mix of payment forms used by consumers (i.e., cash, credit cards, traditional debit cards and prepaid cards) away from products and services offered by MPS, such a shift could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon relationships with various third parties with respect to the operations of the Bank and its divisions, and our relationships with such third parties, some of which are material to us, could adversely affect our business.\nThe Bank has entered into numerous arrangements with third parties with respect to the operations of its business, as described in Part I, Item 1 \"Business.\" Upon the expiration of the then-current term, any such agreements may not be renewed by the third party or may be renewed on terms less favorable to the Bank. In some cases, such agreements may permit the third party to unilaterally prescribe certain business practices and procedures with respect to the Bank and its divisions (as is the case under agreements between MPS and Discover, MasterCard, Visa and other card networks). To the extent any agreement with a service provider is terminated, we may not be able to secure alternate service providers, and, even if we do, the terms with alternate providers may not be as favorable as those currently in place. In addition, were we to lose any of our significant third-party providers, including in our tax refund-related business in which we have a limited number of partners, it could cause a material disruption in our ability to service our customers, which also could have an adverse material impact on the Bank, its divisions and, ultimately, us. Moreover, significant disruptions in our ability to provide services could negatively affect the perception of our business, which could result in a loss of confidence and other adverse effects on our business.\nIn addition, if any of our counterparties is unable to or otherwise does not fulfill (or does not timely fulfill) its obligations to us for any reason (including, but not limited to, bankruptcy, computer or other technological interruptions or failures, personnel loss, negative regulatory actions, or acts of God) or engages in fraud or other misconduct during the course of such relationship, we may need to seek alternative third party service providers, or discontinue certain products or programs in their entirety. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, situations where we have been held directly or indirectly responsible, or were otherwise subject to liability, for the inability of our third party service providers to perform services for our customers on a timely basis or at all or for actions of third parties undertaken on behalf of the Bank or otherwise in connection with the Bank's arrangement with such third parties. Any such responsibility or liability in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business, including the operations of the Bank and its divisions, and financial results.\nIn any event, our agreements with third-parties could come under scrutiny by our regulators, and our regulators could raise an issue with, or object to, any term or provision in such an agreement or any action taken by such third party vis-\u00e0-vis the Bank's operations or customers, resulting in a material adverse effect to us including, but not limited to, the imposition of fines and/or penalties and the material restructuring or termination of such agreement. Moreover, if our regulators examine our third party service providers and find questionable or illegal acts or practices, our regulators could require us to restructure or terminate our agreements with such providers.\nAdditionally, although our network of tax preparation partners is expansive, it is possible that our EROs may choose to offer tax-related products of other companies that provide products and services similar to the Bank's if such other companies offer superior pricing or for other competitive reasons.\nWe derive a significant percentage of our deposits, total assets and income from deposit accounts that we generate through MPS' customer relationships, of which five program manager relationships are particularly significant to our operations.\nWe derive a significant percentage of our deposits, total assets and income from deposit accounts we generate through program manager relationships between third parties and MPS. Deposits related to our top five program managers (each, a significant program manager) totaled $1.27 billion at September 30, 2019. If one of these significant program manager relationships were to be terminated or there is a significant decrease in revenues or deposits associated with any of these business relationships, it could materially reduce our deposits, assets and income. Similarly, if a significant program manager was not replaced, we may be required to seek higher-rate funding sources as compared to the existing program manager, and interest expense might increase.\nOur business strategy includes plans for growth, both through acquisitions and organic growth, and our financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively; our growth through acquisitions may disrupt our existing business.\nAs part of our general growth strategy, we expect to continue to pursue organic growth, while also continuing to evaluate potential acquisitions and expansion opportunities that we believe provide a strategic or geographic fit with our business. Although we have experienced significant growth in our assets, including, most recently, in connection with the Crestmark Acquisition, we may not be able to sustain our historical growth rate or be able to grow at all. We believe that our future organic growth will depend on competitive factors and on the ability of our senior management to continue to maintain a robust system of internal controls and procedures and manage a growing number of customer relationships. See \"We operate in an extremely competitive market, and our business will suffer if we are unable to compete effectively.\" We may not be able to implement changes or improvements to these internal controls and procedures in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. Consequently, continued organic growth, if achieved, may place a strain on our operational infrastructure, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict if or when we may enter into any future acquisition, or the nature or terms of any potential acquisition. To the extent that we grow through acquisitions, we cannot assure that we will be able to adequately and profitably manage this growth or that such acquired businesses will be integrated into our existing businesses as efficiently or in a timely manner as we may anticipate. Acquiring other businesses will generally involve various risks, including:\n\u2022\nincreased capital needs;\n\u2022\nincreased and new regulatory and compliance requirements, including, for example, non-banking regulatory and compliance requirements in jurisdictions where we did not previously operate;\n\u2022\nimplementation or remediation of controls, procedures and policies with respect to the acquired business;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management time and focus from operation of our then-existing business to acquisition-integration efforts;\n\u2022\ncoordination of product, sales, marketing and program and systems management functions;\n\u2022\ntransition of the acquired business's users and customers onto our systems;\n\u2022\nretention and integration of employees from the acquired business into our organization;\n\u2022\nintegration of the acquired business's accounting, information management, human resources and other administrative systems and operations with ours;\n\u2022\npotential liability for activities of the acquired business prior to the acquisition, including violations of law, commercial disputes and tax and other known and unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\npotential increased litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired business, including claims brought by regulators, terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties; and\n\u2022\npotential goodwill impairment.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate an acquired business or technology, or otherwise address these difficulties and challenges or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition, we might not realize the anticipated benefits of that acquisition, we might incur unanticipated liabilities or we might otherwise suffer harm to our business generally, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, acquisitions and investments are often speculative in nature and the actual benefits we derive from them could be less or take longer to materialize than we expect.\nTo the extent we pay the consideration for any future acquisitions or investments in cash, any such payment would reduce the amount of cash available to us for other business purposes. Future acquisitions or investments could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, or impairment charges against goodwill on our balance sheet, any of which could harm our financial condition and negatively impact our stockholders.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new financial products or services within existing lines of business. Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with developing and marketing new lines of business or new products or services, particularly in instances where markets are not fully developed, and we may be required to invest significant time and management and capital resources in connection with such new lines of business or new products or services. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business or new products or services may not be achieved. In addition, price and profitability targets for new lines of business or new products or services may not prove feasible, as we, the Bank or any of the Bank's divisions may need to price products and services on less advantageous terms than anticipated to retain or attract clients. External factors, such as regulatory reception, compliance with regulations and guidance, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business or new product or service may be expensive to implement and could also have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could reduce our revenues and potentially generate losses.\nThere are risks associated with the proposed transaction with Central Bank, including Central\u2019s receipt of required regulatory approvals and timing for completion of the transaction.\nWe recently announced that MetaBank entered into a definitive agreement with Central Bank for the sale of MetaBank\u2019s community bank division to Central. The transaction remains subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, the receipt of third party and regulatory approval and satisfaction of customary closing conditions. It is possible that one or more of the closing conditions may not be satisfied or that it may take an extended amount of time until they are. Accordingly, there is a risk that the proposed transaction may not be completed on a timely basis or at all, which could have adverse effects on the market price of our common stock and our operating results.\nAn impairment charge of goodwill or other intangibles could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we have recently experienced significant growth, in part through acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets are included within our consolidated assets. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets at least annually or sooner if events occur that indicate impairment could exist. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal and regulatory factors, competition, a decrease in our stock price and market capitalization over a sustained period of time, a sustained decline in a reporting unit's fair value or other operating performance indicators. GAAP requires us to assign and then test goodwill at the reporting unit level. If the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its net book value, we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in the future. In addition, if the revenue and cash flows generated from any of our other intangible assets is not sufficient to support its net book value, we may be required to record an impairment charge. For example, in the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter, we recognized a $10.2 million intangible impairment charge related to the non-renewal of the H&R Block relationship. The amount of any impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken.\nChanges in accounting policies or accounting standards, or changes in how accounting standards are interpreted or applied, could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition.\nOur accounting policies are fundamental to determining and understanding our financial results and condition. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. In addition, those that set accounting standards and those that interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, the SEC, banking regulators, and our outside auditors) may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond our control, can be difficult to predict, and could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition. We may be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively or apply an existing standard differently and retroactively, which may result in us being required to restate prior period financial statements, which restatements may reflect material changes.\nWe incur significant costs and demands upon management and accounting and finance resources as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies; if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and our reputation.\nAs an SEC reporting company, we are required to, among other things, maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting, which requires annual management and independent registered public accounting firm assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. We have historically dedicated a significant amount of time and resources to implement our internal financial and accounting controls and procedures. Substantial work may continue to be required to further implement, document, assess, test, and, if necessary, remediate our system of internal controls. We may also need to retain additional finance and accounting personnel in the future.\nControl failures, including failures in our controls over financial reporting, could result from human error, fraud, breakdowns in information and computer systems, lapses in operating processes, or natural or man-made disasters. If a significant control failure or business interruption were to occur, it could materially damage our financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to foresee, prevent, mitigate, reverse, or repair the negative effects of such failures or interruptions.\nWe identified control deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting related to the Crestmark division's information technology control environment, which, as described in Part II, Item 9A \"Controls and Procedures\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we determined, in the aggregate, represent a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting. Other control deficiencies of this or a similar nature may be identified in the future. These and any future control deficiencies could result in us being unable to obtain the required audit or review of our financial statements by our independent registered public accounting firm in a timely manner. Any such control deficiencies could also result in a misstatement of our financial statement accounts and disclosures that, in turn, could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim final statements that may not be prevented or detected.\nIf we are unable to correct the material weakness or deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting in a timely manner or if future instances of an ineffective control environment exist, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC could be adversely affected, and we may be unable to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. This failure, which could cause our investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, could subject us to investigation and sanction by the SEC or other regulatory authorities and to claims by stockholders, which could impose significant additional costs on us, divert our management's attention and materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition. Additionally, our common stock listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market could be suspended or terminated, and our stock price could materially suffer. See also Part II, Item 9A \"Controls and Procedures\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are required to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, and, if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to growth opportunities, losses or an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our compliance with regulatory requirements, would be adversely affected.\nBoth we and the Bank are required to meet regulatory capital requirements and otherwise need to maintain sufficient liquidity to support recent and future growth. We have continued to experience considerable growth recently, having increased our assets from $2.05 billion at September 30, 2014 to $6.18 billion at September 30, 2019, primarily due to strategic transactions, such as the Crestmark Acquisition, and through organic growth. Asset growth, diversification of our lending business, expansion of our financial product offerings and other changes in our asset mix continue to require higher levels of capital, which management believes may not be met through earnings retention alone. Our ability to raise additional capital, when and if needed in the future, to meet such regulatory capital requirements and liquidity needs will depend on conditions in the capital markets, general economic conditions, the performance and prospects of our business and a number of other factors, many of which are outside of our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed or raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAlthough we comply with all current applicable capital requirements, we may be subject to more stringent regulatory capital requirements in the future, and we may need additional capital in order to meet those requirements. If we or the Bank fail to meet applicable minimum capital requirements or cease to be well capitalized, such failure would cause us and the Bank to be subject to regulatory restrictions and could adversely affect customer confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends on common stock, our ability to make distributions on our trust preferred securities, our ability to make acquisitions, and our business, results of operations and financial condition, generally.\nThe Bank relies on brokered deposits to assist in funding its loan and other financing products; accordingly, any change in the Bank's ability to gather brokered deposits may adversely impact the Bank.\nA substantial portion of our deposit liabilities are classified as brokered deposits, and failure to maintain the Bank's status as a \"well capitalized\" institution could have an adverse effect on us, and our ability to fund our operations. Should the Bank ever fail to be well capitalized in the future as a result of not meeting the well capitalized requirements or the imposition of an individual minimum capital requirement or similar formal requirement, then, the Bank would be prohibited, absent waiver from the FDIC, from utilizing brokered deposits (i.e., no insured depository institution that is deemed to be less than \"well capitalized\" may accept, renew or rollover brokered deposits absent a waiver from the FDIC). In such event, such a result could produce material adverse consequences for the Bank with respect to liquidity and could also have material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, and in general, depending on the Bank's condition in the future and its reliance on these deposits as a source of funding, the FDIC could increase the surcharge on our brokered deposits. If we are ever required to pay higher surcharge assessments with respect to these deposits, such payments could be material and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a savings and loan holding company, we are required to serve as a \"source of strength\" for the Bank.\nFederal banking law codifies a requirement that a savings and loan holding company (like us) act as a financial \"source of strength\" for its FDIC-insured depository institution subsidiaries (like the Bank) and permits the OCC, as the Bank's primary federal regulator, to request reports from us to assess our ability to serve as a source of strength for the Bank and to enforce compliance with these statutory requirements. See Part I, Item 1 \"Business - Regulation and Supervision - Holding Company Regulation and Supervision.\" Given the power provided to the federal banking agencies, we, as a source of strength for the Bank, may be required to contribute capital to the Bank when we might not otherwise voluntarily choose to do so. Specifically, the imposition of such financial requirements might require us to raise additional capital to support the Bank at a time when it is not otherwise prudent for us to do so, including on terms that are not typical or favorable to us. See \"We are required to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, and, if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to growth opportunities, losses or an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our compliance with regulatory requirements, would be adversely affected.\" Further, any capital provided by us to the Bank would be subordinate to others with interest in the Bank, including the Bank's depositors. In addition, in the event of our bankruptcy at a time when we had a commitment to one of the Bank's regulators to maintain the capital of the Bank, the regulators' claims against us may be entitled to priority status over other obligations.\nWe may incur losses due to fraudulent and negligent acts, as well as errors, by third parties or our employees.\nWe may incur losses due to fraudulent or negligent acts, misconduct or errors on the part of third parties with which we do business, our employees and individuals and entities unaffiliated with us, including unauthorized wire and automated clearinghouse transactions, the theft of customer data, customer fraud concerning the value of any relevant collateral, identity theft, errors in a customer's tax return, tax return fraud, the counterfeiting of cards and \"skimming\" (whereby a skimmer reads a debit card's encoded mag stripe and a camera records the PIN that is entered by a customer), malicious social engineering schemes (where people are asked to provide a prepaid card or reload product in order to obtain a loan or purchase goods or services) and collusion between participants in the card system to act illegally. Additionally, our employees could hide unauthorized activities from us, engage in improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers, or improperly use confidential information. There can be no assurances that the Bank's program to monitor fraud and other activities will be able to detect all instances of such conduct or that, even if such conduct is detected, we, the Bank, our customers or the third parties with which we do business, including the ATM networks and card payment industry in which the Bank participates, will not be the victims of such activities. Even a single significant instance of fraud, misconduct or other error could result in reputational damage to us, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and other products and services, cause retail distributors or their customers to cease doing business with us or them, or could lead to greater regulation that would increase our compliance costs. Such activities could also result in the imposition of regulatory sanctions, including significant monetary fines, and civil claims which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSecurity breaches involving us, the Bank or any of the third parties with which we do business could expose us to liability and protracted and costly litigation, and could adversely affect our reputation and operating revenues.\nIn connection with our business, we collect and retain significant volumes of sensitive business and personally identifiable information, including social security numbers of our customers and other personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, on our data systems. We and the third parties with which we conduct business may experience security breaches, due in part to the failure of our data encryption technologies or otherwise, involving the receipt, transmission, and storage of confidential customer and other personally identifiable information, including account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses, or other malicious code, cyberattacks, or other events, any of which may arise from human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties or from accidental technological failure. If one or more of these events occurs, it could result in the disclosure of confidential customer information, impairment of our ability to provide products and services to our customers, damage to our reputation with our customers and the market, additional costs (such as costs for repairing systems or adding new personnel or protection technologies), regulatory penalties, and financial losses for us, our clients and other third parties. Such events could also cause interruptions or malfunctions in the operations of our clients, customers, or other third parties with which we engage in business. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats and also due to the expanding use of technology-based products and services by us and our customers. We can provide no assurances that the safeguards we have in place or may implement in the future will prevent all unauthorized infiltrations or breaches and that we will not suffer losses related to a security breach in the future, which losses may be material.\nIn addition, if the Bank or its divisions fail to comply with data security regulations, the Bank could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. For example, the largest credit card associations in the world created the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (the \"PCI DSS\"), a multifaceted standard that includes data security management, policies and procedures as well as other protective measures to protect the nonpublic personal information of cardholders. Compliance with the PCI DSS is costly and changes to the standards could have an equal, or greater, effect on the profitability of one or more of our business divisions.\nOur reputation and financial condition may be harmed by system failures, computer viruses and other technological interruptions to our operations.\nWe rely heavily upon information systems and other operating technologies to efficiently operate and manage our business, including to process transactions through the Internet, including, in particular, in our MPS division. Were there to be a failure or a significant impairment in the operation of any of such systems, we may need to develop alternative processes, including to comply with customer safeguard protocols, during which time revenues and profitability may be lower, and there can be no assurance that we could develop or find such an alternative on terms acceptable to us or at all. Any such disruption in the information systems and other operating technologies utilized by the Bank or its divisions, including due to infiltration by hackers or other intruders, could also result in negative publicity and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAgency, technological, or human error could lead to tax refund processing delays, which could adversely affect our reputation and operating revenues.\nWe and our tax preparation partners rely on the IRS, technology, and employees when processing and preparing tax refunds and tax-related products and services. Any delays during the processing or preparation period could result in reputational damage to us or to our tax preparation partners, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and tax-related products and services, either of which could have a significant adverse impact on our operating revenues and future growth prospects.\nThe earnings of financial services companies, like us, are significantly affected by general business, political and economic conditions.\nOur operations and profitability, including the value of the portfolio of investment securities we hold and the value of collateral securing certain of our loans, are impacted by general business, political and economic conditions in the United States and abroad. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, commodity pricing, money supply and monetary policy, political issues, legislative and regulatory changes, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, broad trends in industry and finance, the strength of the United States economy, and uncertainty in financial markets globally, all of which are beyond our control. A deterioration in business, political or economic conditions, including those arising from government shutdowns, defaults or increases in unemployment, could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and nonperforming assets, decreases in loan collateral values, and a decrease in demand for our products and services, among other things, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions, and determinations as to whether economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans and leases. The level of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates which may, in turn, impact the reliability of our underwriting processes. See also \"If our actual loan and lease losses exceed our allowance for loan and lease losses, our net income will decrease.\"\nThe electronic payments industry, including the prepaid financial services segment within that industry in which the MPS division operates, depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer spending, which may decrease if economic or political conditions in the United States become uncertain or deteriorate and result in a reduction of the number of our prepaid accounts that are purchased or reloaded, the number of transactions involving our cards and the use of our reloadable card products and related services. A sustained reduction in the use of our products and related services, either as a result of a general reduction in consumer spending or as a result of a disproportionate reduction in the use of card-based payment systems, would materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCatastrophic events could occur and impact our operations or the operations third parties with which we do business.\nCatastrophic events (including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, terrorism and other geopolitical events), which are beyond our control, could have an adverse impact on the Bank's ability and the ability of our vendors and other third parties with which we do business, to provide necessary services to support the operation of the Bank and provide products and services to the Bank's customers. Although insurance coverage may provide some protection in light of such events, there can be no assurance that any insurance proceeds would adequately compensate the Bank for the losses it incurred as a result of such events. See also \"Existing insurance policies may not adequately protect us and our subsidiaries.\" Moreover, the damage caused by such events may not be directly compensable from insurance proceeds or otherwise, such as damage to our reputation as a result of such events.\nThe Crestmark division generates government-backed loans funded by the Bank, any of which could be negatively impacted by a variety of factors.\nPrior to its acquisition, the Crestmark division originated loans backed by numerous state and federal government agencies. Risks inherent in the Bank's participation in such programs, through its Crestmark division, include: (i) some of these programs guarantee only a portion of the commercial loan made by the Bank; as such, if the borrower defaults and losses exceed those guaranteed by the government agency, the Bank could realize significant losses; (ii) certain programs, including some guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture, limit the geographic scope of such loans; as such, if the Crestmark division is not able to market these loans to potential borrowers, the Bank's share in this market may be negatively impacted; (iii) the intended beneficiaries of such loan programs may experience a contraction in their credit quality due to local, national, or global economic events or because of factors specific to their business, including, for example, businesses dependent upon the farming and agriculture industry; as such, any negative impact to certain commercial business lines designed to benefit from such government-sponsored loan programs could constrict the Bank's business in these areas; and (iv) nearly all of these guaranteed loan programs are subject to an appropriations process, either at the legislative or regulatory level; this means that funds that may be currently available to guarantee loans or portions of loans could be limited or eliminated in their entirety with little or no advance warning.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment, and our failure to comply with laws and regulations, or changes in laws and regulations to which we are subject, may adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe and the Bank operate in a highly regulated environment, and we are subject to extensive regulation (including, among others, the Dodd-Frank Act, the Basel III Capital Rules, the Bank Secrecy Act and other AML rules), supervision, and examination, including by our primary banking regulators-the OCC and the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Bank is subject to regulation by the FDIC and, to a lesser degree, the Bureau. Prepaid card issuers like the Bank are also subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny based on AML and Bank Secrecy Act concerns, which scrutiny could result in higher compliance costs. See Part I, Item 1 \"Business - Regulation and Supervision\" herein. Banking regulatory authorities have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including, but not limited, to the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by the institution, and the adequacy of an institution's allowance for loan and lease losses. If any of our banking regulators takes informal or formal supervisory action or pursues an enforcement action, any required corrective steps could result in us being subject to additional regulatory requirements, operational restrictions, a consent order, enhanced supervision and/or civil money penalties. Any new requirements or rules, changes in such requirements or rules, changes to or new interpretations of existing requirements or rules, failure to follow requirements or rules, or future lawsuits or rulings could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business, require significant systems redevelopment, render our products or services less profitable or obsolete or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, any changes in the U.S. tax laws as a result of pending tax legislation in the U.S. Congress or otherwise may adversely impact our tax refund processing and settlement business, which could reduce customer demand for our strategic partner's refund advance products, thereby reducing the volume of refund advance loans that we may offer.\nThe Bureau has reshaped certain consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of prohibitions against unfair, deceptive or abusive practices, and such actions have directly impacted, and may continue to impact, the business operations of depository institutions offering consumer financial products or services, including the Bank.\nThe Bureau has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of \"federal consumer financial laws, and to prevent evasions thereof\" with respect to all financial institutions that offer financial products and services to consumers. We cannot predict the impact the Bureau's future actions, including any exercise of its UDAAP authority, will have on the banking industry broadly or us and the Bank specifically. Notwithstanding that insured depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or less (such as the Bank) will continue to be supervised and examined by their primary federal regulators, the full reach and impact of the Bureau's broad rulemaking powers and UDAAP authority on the operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services are currently unknown. The Bureau has initiated enforcement actions against a variety of bank and non-bank market participants with respect to a number of consumer financial products and services that has resulted in those participants expending significant time, money and resources to adjust to the initiatives being pursued by the Bureau. Such enforcement actions may serve as precedent for how the CFPB interprets and enforces consumer protection laws, which may result in the imposition of higher standards of compliance with such laws and, as a result, limit or restrict the Bank with respect to its consumer product offerings. See \"Business - Regulation and Supervision - Bank Regulation and Supervision\" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLegal challenges to and regulatory investigations of our, or the Bank's, operations could have a significant material adverse effect on us.\nFrom time to time, we, the Bank or our other subsidiaries are subject to regulatory supervision and investigation, legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. An adverse resolution in litigation or a regulatory action, including litigation or other actions brought by our shareholders, customers or another third party, such as a state attorney general or one of our regulators, could result in substantial damages or otherwise negatively impact our business, reputation and financial condition. See Part I, Item 1 \"Business - Regulation and Supervision\" and Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings.\"\nProgram agreements that the Bank has entered into with third parties to market and service consumer loans originated by the Bank may subject the Bank to claims from regulatory agencies and other third parties that, if successful, could negatively impact the Bank's current and future business.\nThe Bank has entered into various agreements with unaffiliated third parties (\"Marketers\"), whereby the Marketers will market and service unsecured consumer loans underwritten and originated by the Bank. Certain types of these arrangements have been challenged both in the courts and in regulatory actions. In these actions, plaintiffs have generally argued that the \"true lender\" is the marketer and that the intent of such lending program is to evade state usury and loan licensing laws. Other cases have also included other claims, including racketeering and other state law claims, in their challenge of such programs. There can be no assurance that lawsuits or regulatory actions in connection with any such lending programs the Bank has entered, or will enter, into will not be brought in the future. If a regulatory agency, consumer advocate group, or other third party were to bring an action against the Bank or any of the third parties with which the Bank operates such lending programs, and such actions were successful, such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nThe OCC's new \"fintech\" charter could present a market risk to us generally and the MPS division specifically.\nThe OCC announced on July 31, 2018 that it would begin to accept and evaluate charters for entities that wanted to conduct certain components of a banking business pursuant to a federal charter, known as a \"special purpose national bank\" (\"SPNB\") charter. Intended to promote economic opportunity and spur financial innovation, SPNBs may engage in any of the following activities: paying checks, lending money or taking deposits. In order to obtain an SPNB charter, applicants will have to consider capital, liquidity, and financial inclusion in their application materials. Initially, these entities will be subject to heightened OCC supervision. A U.S. District Court in New York recently set aside the OCC regulation that would have permitted entities that did not intend to accept deposits to receive an SPNB charter. As of the date of this filing, it is not clear what actions, if any, the OCC will take following this rule.\nAs of the date of this filing, the OCC has not announced approval of any applications for an SPNB charter. If any such applications are granted, recipients of an SPNB charter may enter the U.S. payments market in which the Bank operates, which could have a material adverse effect on the Bank and the Payments division.\nOur reputation and business could be damaged by negative publicity.\nReputational risk, including as a result of negative publicity, is inherent in our business. Negative publicity can result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, inadequate protection of customer data, illegal or unauthorized acts taken by third parties that supply products or services to us or the Bank, and ethical behavior of our employees. Damage to our reputation could adversely impact our ability to attract new, and maintain existing, loan and deposit customers, employees and business relationships, and, particularly with respect to our payments division, could result in the imposition of new regulatory requirements, operational restrictions, enhanced supervision and/or civil money penalties. Such damage could also adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital, and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nExisting insurance policies may not adequately protect us and our subsidiaries.\nFidelity, business interruption, cybersecurity, and property insurance policies are in place with respect to our operations. Should any event triggering such policies occur, however, it is possible that our policies would not fully reimburse us for the losses we could sustain due to deductible limits, policy limits, coverage limits, or other factors. We generally renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. If the cost of coverage becomes too high, we may need to reduce our policy limits, increase the deductibles or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage in order to reduce the premiums to an acceptable amount.\nThe loss of key members of our senior management team or key employees in the Bank's divisions, or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior executive management team. Their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us. Our future success also depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate key management and operating personnel. Management transition may create uncertainty and involve a diversion of resources and management attention, be disruptive to our daily operations or impact public or market perception, any of which could negatively impact our ability to operate effectively or execute our strategies and result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAdditionally, as we continue to develop and expand our operations, we may require personnel with different skills and experiences, with a sound understanding of our business and the industries in which we operate. The competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense, and the loss of any of our key personnel or an inability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nWe and our divisions regularly assess our investments in technology, and changes in technology could be costly.\nThe fintech industry is undergoing technological innovation at a fast pace. To keep up with our competition, we regularly evaluate technology to determine whether it may help us compete on a cost-effective basis. This is especially true with respect to our payments division, which requires significant expenditures to exploit technology and to develop new products and services to meet customers' needs. The cost of investing in, implementing and maintaining such technology is high, and there can be no assurance, given the fast pace of change and innovation, that our technology, either purchased or developed internally, will meet our needs, in a timely, cost-effective manner or at all. During the course of implementing new technology into our or the Bank's operations, we may experience system interruptions and failures. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will recognize, in a timely manner or at all, the benefits that we may expect as a result of our implementing new technology into our operations. In connection with our implementation of new lines of business, offering of new financial products or acquisitions, including, most recently, the Crestmark Acquisition, we may experience significant, one-time or recurring technology-related costs. See also \"Our business strategy includes plans for growth, both through acquisitions and organic growth, and our financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively; our growth through acquisitions may disrupt our existing business.\"\nOur ability to receive dividends from the Bank could affect our liquidity and ability to pay interest on our trust preferred securities or reinstate dividends.\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Our primary source of cash, other than securities offerings, is dividends from the Bank. These dividends are a principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock, interest on our trust preferred securities and interest and principal on our debt.Various laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay us, as further described in Part I, Item 1 \"Business - Regulation and Supervision - Bank Regulation and Supervision - Limitations on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Such limitations could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and on our ability to pay dividends on common stock. Additionally, if the Bank's earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels, we may not be able to make payments on our trust preferred securities or make dividend payments to our common shareholders.\nUnclaimed funds represented by unused value on the cards presents compliance and other risks.\nThe concept of escheatment involves the reporting and delivery of property to states that is abandoned when its rightful owner cannot be readily located and/or identified. In the context of prepaid cards, the customer funds represented by such cards can sometimes be \"abandoned\" or unused for the relevant period of time set forth in each applicable state's abandoned property laws. MPS utilizes automated programs designed to comply with applicable escheatment laws and regulations. There appears, however, to be a movement among some state regulators to more broadly interpret definitions in escheatment statutes and regulations than in the past. State regulators may choose to initiate collection or other litigation action against prepaid card issuers, like MPS, for unreported abandoned property, and such actions may seek to assess fines and penalties.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile, which may result in losses for investors.\nThe market price for shares of our common stock has been volatile in the past, and several factors, including factors outside of our control and unrelated to our performance, could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include:\n\u2022\nannouncements of developments related to our business;\n\u2022\nthe initiation, pendency or outcome of litigation, regulatory reviews, inquiries and investigations, and any related adverse publicity;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nsales of substantial amounts of our securities into the marketplace;\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the banking industry or the worldwide economy;\n\u2022\na shortfall in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts' expectations;\n\u2022\nlack of an active trading market for the common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in analysts' recommendations or projections; and\n\u2022\nannouncement of new acquisitions, dispositions or other projects.\nGeneral market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit.\nOur common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund, or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our common stock is inherently subject to risks, including those described in this \"Risk Factors\" section, and is subject to forces that affect the financial markets in general. As a result, if you hold or acquire our common stock, it is possible that you may lose all or a portion of your investment.\nFuture sales or additional issuances of our capital stock may depress prices of shares of our common stock or otherwise dilute the book value of shares then outstanding.\nSales of a substantial amount of our capital stock in the public market or the issuance of a significant number of shares could adversely affect the market price for shares of our common stock. As of September 30, 2019, we were authorized to issue up to 90,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 37,807,064 shares were outstanding, and 14,444 shares were held as treasury stock. We were also authorized to issue up to 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock and 3,000,000 shares of non-voting common stock, none of which were outstanding or reserved for issuance. Future sales or additional issuances of stock may affect the market price for shares of our common stock.\nFederal regulations and our organizational documents may inhibit a takeover or prevent a transaction you may favor or limit our growth opportunities, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nCertain provisions of our charter documents and federal regulations could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us. In addition, we may need to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we can acquire control of any other company. Such approvals could involve significant expenses related to diligence, legal compliance, and the submission of required applications and could be conditioned on acts or practices that limit or otherwise constrain our operations.\nWe may not be able to pay dividends in the future in accordance with past practice.\nWe have historically paid a quarterly dividend to stockholders. The payment of dividends is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. Any payment of dividends in the future will depend, in large part, on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, regulatory review, and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.", "PERMNO": 79571, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "CASH"}
