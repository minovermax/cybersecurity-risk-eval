{"cik": "918251", "company": "MOTORCAR PARTS AMERICA INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-06-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nWhile we believe the risk factors described below are all the material risks currently facing our business, additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. Our financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted by these risks, and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely impacted by any of these risks. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information included in or incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K.\nWe rely on a few large customers for a majority of our business, and the loss of any of these customers, significant changes in the prices, marketing allowances or other important terms provided to any of these customers or adverse developments with respect to the financial condition of these customers could reduce our net income and operating results.\nOur net sales are concentrated among a small number of large customers. During fiscal 2015, sales to our four largest customers in the aggregate represented 89% of our net sales, and sales to our largest customer represented 56% of our net sales. We are under ongoing pressure from our major customers to offer lower prices, extended payment terms, increased marketing allowances and other terms more favorable to these customers because our sales to these customers are concentrated, and the market in which we operate is very competitive. These customer demands have put continued pressure on our operating margins and profitability, resulted in periodic contract renegotiation to provide more favorable prices and terms to these customers and significantly increased our working capital needs. In addition, this customer concentration leaves us vulnerable to any adverse change in the financial condition of these customers. The loss of or a significant decline in sales to any of these customers could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere have been and may be additional claims filed against us in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings involving the Fenco Entities.\nThere have been and may be additional claims filed against us by the trustee and some or all of the creditors in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings involving the Fenco Entities.\nIn February 2015, M&T Bank filed a complaint in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles, against us and some of our executives alleging negligent misrepresentation, tortious interference with contractual relationship, conspiracy, unjust enrichment, conversion, declaratory judgment/alter ego, breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The plaintiff is seeking unspecified damages, punitive damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and other relief.\nIn addition, the trustee has notified us and our insurance companies that the trustee may have claims for wrongful acts, breach of fiduciary duty, civil conspiracy, aiding and abetting, negligence and conversion, but has not filed any litigation at this time.\nWe are also a defendant in the following cases: one in Ontario Superior Court and another in the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In each case the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that we are liable for amounts due from the Fenco Entities to their employees under applicable U.S. and Canadian law. We are in negotiations with respect to these cases, although there can be no assurance whether the cases will settle and, if they settle, on what terms. In this connection, we have established a reserve of $1,000,000, which has been incorporated into the financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nAny litigation to determine the validity of these claims, regardless of its merit or resolution, may be costly and time consuming and divert the efforts and attention of our management from its business strategy. Any adverse judgment or settlement by us of these claims could also result in significant additional expense.\nOur offshore remanufacturing and logistic activities expose us to increased political and economic risks and place a greater burden on management to achieve quality standards.\nOur overseas operations, especially our operations in Mexico, increase our exposure to political, criminal or economic instability in the host countries and to currency fluctuations. Risks are inherent in international operations, including:\n\u00b7 exchange controls and currency restrictions;\n\u00b7 currency fluctuations and devaluations;\n\u00b7 changes in local economic conditions;\n\u00b7 repatriation restrictions (including the imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries);\n\u00b7 global sovereign uncertainty and hyperinflation in certain foreign countries;\n\u00b7 laws and regulations relating to export and import restrictions;\n\u00b7 exposure to government actions; and\n\u00b7 exposure to local political or social unrest including resultant acts of war, terrorism or similar events.\nThese and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our offshore activities and on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our overall success as a business depends, in part, upon our ability to manage our foreign operations. We may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business, and failure to do so could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInterruptions or delays in obtaining component parts could impair our business and adversely affect our operating results.\nIn our remanufacturing processes, we obtain Used Cores, primarily through the core exchange program with our customers, and component parts from third-party manufacturers. We generally purchase approximately 15-20% of our Used Cores from core brokers. Historically, the Used Core returned from customers together with purchases from core brokers have provided us with an adequate supply of Used Cores. If there was a significant disruption in the supply of Used Cores, whether as a result of increased Used Core acquisitions by existing or new competitors or otherwise, our operating activities could be materially and adversely impacted. In addition, a number of the other components used in the remanufacturing process are available from a very limited number of suppliers. We are, as a result, vulnerable to any disruption in component supply, and any meaningful disruption in this supply would materially and adversely impact our operating results.\nIncreases in the market prices of key component raw materials could increase the cost of our products and negatively impact our profitability.\nIn light of the continuous pressure on pricing which we have experienced from our large customers, we may not be able to recoup the higher costs of our products due to changes in the prices of raw materials, particularly aluminum and copper. If we are unable to recover a substantial portion of our raw materials from Used Cores returned to us by our customers through the core exchange program, the prices of Used Cores that we purchase may reflect the impact of changes in the cost of raw materials. However, we are unable to determine what adverse impact, if any, sustained raw material price increases may have on our product costs or profitability.\nSubstantial and potentially increasing competition could reduce our market share and significantly harm our financial performance.\nWhile we believe we are well-positioned in the automotive aftermarket, this market is very competitive. In addition, other overseas manufacturers, particularly those located in China, are increasing their operations and could become a significant competitive force in the future. We may not be successful competing against other companies, some of which are larger than us and have greater financial and other resources at their disposal. Increased competition could put additional pressure on us to reduce prices or take other actions which may have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur financial results are affected by automotive parts failure rates that are outside of our control.\nOur operating results are affected over the long term by automotive parts failure rates. These failure rates are impacted by a number of factors outside of our control, including, the age of cars, product designs that have resulted in greater reliability, the number of miles driven by consumers, and the average age of vehicles on the road. A reduction in the failure rates of automotive parts would adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nOur operating results may continue to fluctuate significantly.\nWe have experienced significant variations in our annual and quarterly results of operations. These fluctuations have resulted from many factors, including shifts in the demand and pricing for our products, general economic conditions, including changes in prevailing interest rates, and the introduction of new products. Our gross profit percentage fluctuates due to numerous factors, some of which are outside of our control. These factors include the timing and level of marketing allowances provided to our customers, actual sales during the relevant period, pricing strategies, the mix of products sold during a reporting period, and general market and competitive conditions. We also incur allowances, accruals, charges and other expenses that differ from period to period based on changes in our business, which causes our operating income and net income to fluctuate.\nOur lenders may not waive future defaults under our credit agreements.\nOver the past several years, we have violated a number of the financial and other covenants contained in our credit agreements with a syndicate of lenders, Cerberus Business Finance, LLC, as collateral agent, and PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. Our most recent waiver was in June 2013. If we fail to meet the financial covenants or the other obligations set forth in our credit agreements in the future, there is no assurance that our lenders will waive any such defaults. If obtained, any such waiver may impose significant costs or covenants on us.\nOur level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position.\nAs of March 31, 2015, we had $80,101,000 of net debt under our credit agreement and cash on hand of $61,230,000. Our indebtedness may increase substantially from time to time for various reasons, including fluctuations in operating results, marketing allowances provided to customers, Remanufactured Core inventory purchases from our customers, capital expenditures and possible acquisitions. Our indebtedness could materially affect our business because (i) a portion of our cash flow must be used to service debt rather than finance our operations, (ii) it may eventually impair our ability to obtain financing in the future, and (iii) it may reduce our flexibility to respond to changes in business and economic conditions or take advantage of business opportunities that may arise.\nOur stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially.\nOur stock price has fluctuated from $21.79 to $36.43 during fiscal 2015. It may decline substantially as a result of developments in our business, the volatile nature of the stock market, and other factors beyond our control. The stock market has, from time to time, experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Many factors may cause the market price for our common stock to decline, including (i) our operating results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any quarter, (ii) downward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates, (iii) market perceptions concerning our future earnings prospects, (iv) public or private sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, and (v) adverse changes in general market conditions or economic trends.\nUnfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us.\nWe are exposed to market risk from material movements in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate. In fiscal 2015, approximately 12% of our total expenses were in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result of our extensive operations in Mexico, our primary risk relates to changes in the rates between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso. To mitigate this currency risk, we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to exchange U.S. dollars for Mexican pesos. We also enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to exchange U.S. dollars for Chinese yuan in order to mitigate risk related to our purchases and payments to our Chinese vendors. The extent to which we use forward foreign exchange contracts is periodically reviewed in light of our estimate of market conditions and the terms and length of anticipated requirements. The use of derivative financial instruments allows us to reduce our exposure to the risk that the eventual net cash outflow resulting from funding the expenses of the foreign operations will be materially affected by changes in the exchange rates. We do not engage in currency speculation or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. These contracts generally expire in a year or less. Any change in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts is accounted for as an increase or decrease to general and administrative expenses in current period earnings.\nWe may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce significant risks and uncertainties, including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses and achieving benefits from the acquisitions.\nIn order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities, we have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include:\n\u00b7 the difficulty in integrating newly-acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner;\n\u00b7 the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions;\n\u00b7 the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses;\n\u00b7 the risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our operations;\n\u00b7 risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems;\n\u00b7 difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses; and\n\u00b7 future impairments of any goodwill of an acquired business.\nAny of the foregoing, or a combination of them, could cause us to incur additional expenses, distract management and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nWeakness in conditions in the global credit markets and macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny weakness in the credit markets could result in significant constraints on liquidity and availability of borrowing terms from lenders and accounts payable with vendors. Modest economic growth in most major industrial countries in the world and uncertain prospects for continued growth threaten to cause further tightening of the credit markets, more stringent lending standards and terms, and higher interest rates. The persistence of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our borrowings and the availability, terms and cost of such borrowings. In addition, deterioration in the U.S. economy could materially and adversely impact our operating results.\nOur reliance on foreign suppliers for some of the automotive parts we sell to our customers or included in our products presents risks to our business.\nA significant portion of automotive parts and components we use in our remanufacturing process are imported from suppliers located outside the U.S., including various countries in Asia. As a result, we are subject to various risks of doing business in foreign markets and importing products from abroad, such as:\n\u25cf significant delays in the delivery of cargo due to port security considerations;\n\u25cf imposition of duties, taxes, tariffs or other charges on imports;\n\u25cf imposition of new legislation relating to import quotas or other restrictions that may limit the quantity of our product that may be imported into the U.S. from countries or regions where we do business;\n\u25cf financial or political instability in any of the countries in which our product is manufactured;\n\u25cf potential recalls or cancellations of orders for any product that does not meet our quality standards;\n\u25cf disruption of imports by labor disputes or strikes and local business practices;\n\u25cf political or military conflict involving the U.S., which could cause a delay in the transportation of our products and an increase in transportation costs;\n\u25cf heightened terrorism security concerns, which could subject imported goods to additional, more frequent or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods;\n\u25cf natural disasters, disease epidemics and health related concerns, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;\n\u25cf inability of our non-U.S. suppliers to obtain adequate credit or access liquidity to finance their operations; and\n\u25cf our ability to enforce any agreements with our foreign suppliers.\nAny of the foregoing factors, or a combination of them, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nIn addition, because we depend on independent third parties to manufacture a significant portion of our wheel hub and other purchased finished goods, we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with such manufacturers, such as reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with merchandise specifications, insufficient quality controls and failure to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs.\nOur failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d) requires our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at the end of each fiscal year and certify whether or not internal control over financial reporting is effective. Our independent accountants are also required to express an opinion with respect to the effectiveness of our internal controls. In the past we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in our discontinued subsidiary. We cannot assure that additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Any failure to maintain or implement new or improved internal controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations (which may result in our failure to maintain the listing standards for our common stock) or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under SOX.\nAn increase in the cost or a disruption in the flow of our imported products may significantly decrease our sales and profits.\nMerchandise manufactured offshore represents a significant portion of our total product purchases. A disruption in the shipping or cost of such merchandise may significantly decrease our sales and profits. In addition, if imported merchandise becomes more expensive or unavailable, the transition to alternative sources may not occur in time to meet our demands. Merchandise from alternative sources may also be of lesser quality and more expensive than those we currently import. Risks associated with our reliance on imported merchandise include disruptions in the shipping and importation or increase in the costs of imported products. For example, common risks may be:\n\u00b7 raw material shortages;\n\u00b7 work stoppages;\n\u00b7 strikes and political unrest;\n\u00b7 problems with oceanic shipping, including shipping container shortages;\n\u00b7 increased customs inspections of import shipments or other factors causing delays in shipments;\n\u00b7 economic crises;\n\u00b7 international disputes and wars;\n\u00b7 loss of \u201cmost favored nation\u201d trading status by the U. S. in relations to a particular foreign country;\n\u00b7 import duties;\n\u00b7 import quotas and other trade sanctions; and\n\u00b7 increases in shipping rates.\nProducts manufactured overseas and imported into the U.S. and other countries are subject to import restrictions and duties.\nIf our technology and telecommunications systems were to fail, or we were not able to successfully anticipate, invest in or adopt technological advances in our industry, it could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nWe rely on computer and telecommunications systems to communicate with our customers and vendors and manage our business. The temporary or permanent loss of our computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems, through casualty, operating malfunction, software virus or service provider failure, could disrupt our operations. In addition, our future growth may require additional investment in our systems to keep up with technological advances in our industry. If we are not able to invest in or adopt changes to our systems, or such upgrades take longer or cost more than anticipated, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 80341, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "MPAA"}
