RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks or others not specified below materialize, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of cumulative losses and we do not expect to be profitable for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred losses in each of the last seven years, including a net loss of $34.9 million in 2015, $56.2 million in 2014 and $75.4 million in 2013. At December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $318.5 million. As we continue to invest in infrastructure, development of our solutions and international expansion and changes to our sales and marketing efforts, our operating expenses may continue to increase. Additionally, to accommodate future growth, we have transitioned our customer data centers from third-party service providers to co-located facilities managed by our internal hosting operations team and the costs and expenses associated with this transition may exceed the rate at which we realize any associated incremental billings or revenues. As a result, our losses in future periods may be significantly greater than the losses we would incur if we developed our business more slowly. In addition, the transition and changes to our sales and marketing efforts may not result in increases in our\nrevenues or billings or provide the gross margin improvements we anticipated, which may result in us undertaking cost savings initiatives or identifying opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies in how we conduct our business. Such cost savings initiatives we make may not have the intended result and could have a negative impact on our organization, billings, revenue, renewal rates and operating results.\nAlthough we have experienced revenue growth in prior periods, you should not consider any previous revenue growth or growth rates as indicative of our future performance. We do not expect to be profitable on a GAAP basis in the foreseeable future and we cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability on a GAAP basis in the future or that, if we do become profitable, we will sustain profitability.\nOur quarterly results are likely to fluctuate due to a number of factors, and the value of our stock could decline substantially.\nOur quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate. For example, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new billings and renewals. This pattern may be amplified over time if the number of customers with renewal dates occurring in the fourth quarter continues to increase. Fluctuations in our quarterly financial results may be caused by a number of factors, many of which are out of our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe renewal rates for our products;\n\u2022\nupsell rates for our solutions and services;\n\u2022\nchanges in deferred revenue balances due to changes in the average duration of subscriptions, rate of renewals, timing of renewal billings, composition of billings for professional services, amount of multi-year prepayments, amount of non-renewable perpetual license billings and the rate of new business growth;\n\u2022\nchanges in the composition of current period billings;\n\u2022\nchanges in the mix of the average term length and payment terms;\n\u2022\nchanges in the mix of our revenue derived from internal and external communities;\n\u2022\norder sizes in any given quarter;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies, whether initiated by us or as a response to competitive or other factors;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing associated with, and management effort for, the introduction of new products and product features;\n\u2022\nthe rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force;\n\u2022\nthe length of the sales cycle for our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in our go-to-market strategy;\n\u2022\nthe success of our channel partners and strategic partners in reselling our products;\n\u2022\nthe success of our international expansion strategy;\n\u2022\nnew solution introductions by our competitors;\n\u2022\nour success in selling our platform to large enterprises;\n\u2022\nour success in selling into the IT department of our customers;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions that may adversely affect either our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or a larger deployment, or hinder or delay a prospective customer\u2019s purchasing decision, or reduce the value of new subscriptions, or affect renewal rates or the timing of renewals;\n\u2022\ntiming of additional investments in the development of our platform or deployment of our services;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in our hosting services or our inability to meet service level agreements and any resulting refunds to customers;\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches and potential financial penalties to customers and government entities;\n\u2022\nconcerns over government-sponsored electronic surveillance activities;\n\u2022\npurchases of new equipment and bandwidth in connection with our data center expansion;\n\u2022\nregulatory compliance costs;\n\u2022\npotential delay in revenue recognition for product acceptance rights;\n\u2022\nthe timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers;\n\u2022\nthe impact on services margins as a result of the use of third-party contractors to fulfill demand;\n\u2022\nthe impact on services margins as a result of periods of less than full utilization of our full-time services employees;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with acquisitions of companies and technologies;\n\u2022\npotential goodwill, other long-lived asset or capitalized software development cost impairment;\n\u2022\nthe impact of capitalized research and development costs on current and future periods;\n\u2022\nextraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments;\n\u2022\nadjustments arising from future foreign, state and local sales and income tax examinations;\n\u2022\nthe impact of new accounting pronouncements; and\n\u2022\nthe timing and size of stock awards to employees.\nBased on the factors described above, we believe that our quarterly operating results may vary significantly in the future and that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be indicative of future results.\nIn addition, due to our evolving business model, the rapid pace of technological change, the unpredictability of the emerging market in which we participate, and potential fluctuations in future general economic and financial market conditions, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. We plan our expense levels and investments on estimates of future billings, revenues and anticipated rate of growth. We may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if the addition of new customers, the upsell rate for existing customers, or the price for which we are able to sell our platform is below our expectations. As a result, we expect that our billings, revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly and comparisons of our billings, revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nFurthermore, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, and the market price for our common stock could decline. If one or more of the securities analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, the market price for our common stock could decline. Additionally, our stock price may be based on expectations, estimates or forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or may not be achieved. Further, our stock price may be affected by financial media, including press reports and blogs.\nBecause we generally recognize revenues from subscriptions for our products ratably over the term of the agreement, near term changes in sales may not be reflected immediately in our operating results.\nWe generally recognize revenues from customers ratably over the term of their agreements, which generally range from 12 to 36 months. As a result, most of the revenues we report in each quarter are derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters or years. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter is not likely to be reflected immediately in our revenues results for that quarter. Such declines, however, would negatively affect our revenues in future periods and the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our solutions, and potential changes in our rate of renewals, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our total revenues through additional sales in any period, as revenues from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. In some instances, our customers choose to pre-pay the entire term of their multi-year subscriptions up front. As a result, billings can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.\nOur future growth is, in large part, dependent upon the widespread adoption of collaboration software by enterprises and it is difficult to forecast the rate at which this will happen.\nCollaboration software for enterprises remains at an early stage of technological and market development and the extent to which enterprise collaboration software will become widely adopted remains uncertain. It continues to remain difficult to predict customer adoption rates, customer demand for our platform, the future growth rate and size of this market and the entry of competitive solutions. Any expansion of the enterprise collaboration software market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value and benefits associated with enterprise collaboration software. If enterprise collaboration software does not achieve widespread adoption, or if there is a reduction in demand for enterprise collaboration software caused by a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, weakening economic conditions, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate spending or otherwise, it could result in lower billings, reduced renewal rates and decreased revenues and our business could be adversely affected. Additionally, mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and could adversely affect our revenues and billings. In particular, if our customers are acquired by entities that are not our customers, are customers of our competitors, or that use fewer of our solutions, or that have more favorable contract terms and choose to discontinue, reduce or change the terms of their use of our platform, our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe market for enterprise collaboration software is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed.\nThe market for enterprise collaboration software is highly competitive and rapidly evolving with new competitors entering the market. We expect the competitive landscape to continue to intensify in the future as a result of regularly evolving customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We currently compete with large well-established multi-solution enterprise software vendors, stand-alone enterprise software application providers, and smaller software application vendors. Our primary competition for internal communities currently comes from large well-established enterprise software vendors such as Microsoft\nCorporation, IBM Corporation and salesforce.com, inc., each of which is significantly larger than we are, have greater name recognition, larger customer bases, much longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, and is able to provide comprehensive business solutions that are broader in scope than the solutions we offer. These well-established vendors may have preexisting relationships with our existing and potential customers and to the extent our solutions are not viewed as being superior in features, function and integration or priced competitively to existing solutions, we might have difficulty displacing them. We also compete with stand-alone enterprise software applications that have begun adding social features to their existing offerings. Some of these companies have large installed bases of active customers that may prefer to implement enterprise collaboration software solutions that are provided by an existing provider of customer management software, and these companies may be able to offer discounts and other pricing incentives that make their solutions more attractive. For our external community business, we also compete with standalone privately held software providers, whose primary products are focused on providing external communities to their customers. For our team-based real time messaging business, we compete with many smaller startup software providers, whose primary products are focused on providing real time messaging products to their customers. In addition, large social and professional networking providers with greater name recognition, financial resources and other resources may add enterprise collaboration applications to their existing applications. For example, in early 2015 Facebook announced plans to launch Facebook at Work to provide an enterprise version of its social network service. In addition, our competitors have in the past, and may in the future, enter into strategic alliances with each other, resulting in increased competition. To the extent that our competitors are successful in combining these social networking capabilities with their existing products and to the extent social and professional networking providers are able to adapt their solutions to the enterprise collaboration market, we could experience increased competition, which could adversely affect our billings, renewal rates, revenues and margins.\nSome of our competitors offer their solutions at a lower price or at no incremental cost, which has resulted in pricing pressures and increased competition. If we are unable to price our solutions appropriately, our operating results could be negatively impacted. In addition, lower margins, pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales and billings, losses or the failure of our platform to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their product offerings or resources. Certain current competitors have been, and current or potential competitors may be, acquired by third parties with greater available resources and as a result of such acquisitions, might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs, devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their solutions, initiate or withstand substantial price competition, take advantage of other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their offerings more quickly than we do. If we are unable to compete effectively for a share of our market, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have made changes to the structure, scale and makeup of the sales organization and their focus which may harm our future operating results.\nWe have recently made changes in sales leadership, increased our emphasis on the mid-market through the expansion of our inside sales organization, diversified our focus beyond large enterprise transactions, placed greater emphasis on selling our cloud-based solutions and developed targeted use cases to industry lines-of-business and verticals. There is no guarantee that these changes will increase our revenue and it could adversely affect billings, renewal rates and revenues and our business and operating results could be negatively impacted.\nWe cannot accurately predict new subscription, subscription renewal or upsell rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenues and operating results.\nIn order for us to improve our operating results and continue to grow our business, it is important that we continually attract new customers and that existing customers renew their subscriptions with us when their existing contract term expires. Our existing customers have no contractual obligation to renew their subscriptions after the initial subscription period and we cannot accurately predict renewal rates. Our customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, their satisfaction with our products and our customer support, the level of usage of our platform within their enterprise, the frequency and severity of outages, our product uptime or latency, the pricing of our, or competing, software or professional services, the effects of global economic conditions, and reductions in spending levels or changes in our customers\u2019 strategies regarding enterprise collaboration tools. If our customers renew their subscriptions, they may renew for fewer users or page views, for shorter contract lengths or on other terms that are less economically beneficial to us. For the year, our renewal rates, excluding upsell, have declined to below 90% for transactions over $50,000, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in future periods. If customers enter into shorter initial subscription periods, the risk of customers not renewing their subscriptions with us would increase and our billings and revenues may be adversely impacted. We cannot assure you that our customers will renew their subscriptions, and if our customers do not renew their agreements or renew on less favorable terms, our revenues may grow more slowly than expected or decline and our billings may be adversely impacted.\nTo the extent we are successful in increasing our customer base, we could incur increased losses because costs associated with generating customer agreements and performing services are generally incurred up front, while revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. This risk is particularly applicable for those customers who choose to deploy our products in the public cloud. If new customers sign agreements with short initial subscription periods and do not renew their subscriptions, our operating results could be negatively impacted due to the upfront expenses associated with our sales and implementation efforts. Alternatively, to the extent we are unsuccessful in increasing our customer base, we could also incur increased losses as costs associated with marketing programs and new products intended to attract new customers would not be offset by future incremental revenues and cash flow.\nIn order for us to improve our operating results, it is important that our customers make additional significant purchases of our functionality and offerings, including additional communities, modules, users or page views or professional services. If our customers do not purchase additional functionality or offerings, our revenues may grow more slowly than expected. Additionally, increasing incremental sales to our current customer base requires increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. We also invest various resources targeted at expanding the utilization rates of our products. There can be no assurance that our efforts would result in increased sales to existing customers, or upsells, and additional revenues. If our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful, our business will suffer.\nAdditionally, our quarterly sales cycles are frequently more heavily weighted toward the end of the quarter with an increased volume of sales in the last few weeks of the quarter. If this trend becomes more exaggerated, it could negatively impact the timing of recognized revenues, cash collections and delivery of professional services in subsequent periods. Furthermore, the concentration of contract negotiations in the last few weeks of the quarter could require us to hire additional sales, legal and finance employees.\nWe depend on key personnel, members of our board of directors, and our senior management team to run and oversee our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or the inability of replacements to quickly and successfully perform in their roles could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers, which includes key leadership in the areas of research and development, marketing, sales, product, services and the general and administrative functions. The loss of the services of our senior management or any of our key personnel, the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel, or delays in hiring required personnel could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives, and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Our productivity and the quality of our products may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively.\nIn the last year we have announced the departure of three of our board members and the addition of two new board members. In addition, some of the members of our current management team have only been working together for a short period of time. Furthermore, from time to time, there may be additional changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. In the future, there may be additional changes to our board of directors or management team which could divert management\u2019s attention and disrupt our business.\nWe are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development personnel because of the complexity of our platform and other solutions. Our personnel do not have employment arrangements that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business.\nBecause competition for our target employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our operations and growing customer base.\nOur future success will depend on our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain talent. In the software industry in general, and in the San Francisco Bay Area specifically, there is substantial and continuous competition for software engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software, as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the value of our stock does not increase or declines, it may adversely affect our ability to retain highly skilled employees. In addition, since we expense all stock-based compensation, we may periodically change our stock compensation practices, which may include reducing the number of employees eligible for options or reducing the size of equity awards granted per employee. If the anticipated value of such stock-based incentive awards does not materialize, if our stock-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, or if our total compensation package is not viewed\nas being competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.\nBecause our long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand our sales to customers outside the United States, our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nWe sell our products primarily through our direct sales organization, which is comprised of inside sales and field sales personnel located in a variety of geographic regions, including the United States, Canada, the Asia Pacific region, South America and Europe. Sales outside of the United States represented approximately 27%, 24% and 23% of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As we continue to expand sales of our products to customers located outside the United States, our business will be increasingly susceptible to risks associated with international operations. However, we have a limited operating history outside the United States, and our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally, particularly in new geographies, requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to particular challenges of supporting a business in an environment of diverse cultures, languages, customs, tax laws, legal systems, alternate dispute systems and regulatory systems. The risks and challenges associated with international expansion include:\n\u2022\ncontinued localization of our platform, sales collateral and legal agreements, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u2022\ncompliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with anti-bribery laws, including compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Anti-Bribery Act;\n\u2022\ninternational customers\u2019 potential reluctance to do business with U.S. companies who host content and data as a result of concerns around alleged data monitoring activities by the United States National Security Administration (the \u201cNSA\u201d);\n\u2022\nregional data privacy laws that apply to the processing of personal information, particularly those focused on the transmission of our customers\u2019 data across international borders;\n\u2022\nability to provide local hosting, consulting and support services;\n\u2022\ndifferent pricing environments, including invoicing and collecting in foreign currencies and associated foreign currency exposure;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and the increased travel, infrastructure, accounting, tax and legal compliance costs associated with international operations;\n\u2022\ndifferent or lesser protection of our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, longer payment cycles and other collection difficulties;\n\u2022\nregional economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\ndisruption as a result of the obligation of certain of our personnel in Israel to perform military service; and\n\u2022\nsecurity concerns such as civil or military unrest and terrorist activities.\nAdditionally, a substantial majority of our international customers currently pay us in U.S. dollars and, as a result, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may make our platform more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. In the future, an increasing number of our customers may pay us in foreign currencies. Any fluctuation in the exchange rate of these foreign currencies or pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe, may negatively impact our business. If we are unable to successfully manage the challenges of international operations and expansion, our growth could be limited, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur sales cycle can be long and unpredictable, particularly with respect to large enterprises, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some of the more complex transactions, which could harm our business and operating results.\nThe timing of our sales is difficult to predict. Our sales efforts involve educating our customers, frequently at an executive level, about the use, potential return on investment, technical capabilities, security and other benefits of our products. Customers often undertake a prolonged product-evaluation process which frequently involves not only our solutions but also those of our competitors. As we continue to target our sales efforts at large enterprise customers, we will face greater costs, long sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In this market segment, the customer\u2019s decision to subscribe to our platform may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, may require us to provide even greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our products and obtain support from multiple departments within larger enterprises, as well as obtain support from the IT departments. In addition, prospective enterprise customers may require customized features and functions unique to their business\nprocess and may require acceptance testing related to those unique features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support, operational support, technical support and professional services resources to individual customers, increasing costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the acceptance requirements have been met.\nOur internally managed data hosting facilities expose us to additional risks which could result in operational inefficiencies, increase our costs and ultimately have a negative impact on our business.\nOur internally managed hosting facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They are also subject to employee negligence, break-ins, computer viruses, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct. The occurrence of any of these disasters, or other unanticipated problems, could result in lengthy interruptions in our service, which would materially impact our customers\u2019 use of our offerings and may result in financial penalties for which we will be directly and solely responsible.\nIn addition, we are subject to other risks and challenges inherent in managing the infrastructure that hosts our customer communities, including any failure to properly plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and our inability to obtain and maintain the technologies and personnel necessary to cause the hosting services to operate efficiently and in accordance with our contractual commitments, including those pertaining to uptime and security.\nTo the extent that we are required to add data center capacity to accommodate customer demands for additional bandwidth or storage to enable their communities, we may need to significantly increase the bandwidth, storage, power or other elements of our hosting operations, and the costs associated with adjustments to our data center architecture could also negatively affect our margins and operating results.\nInterruptions or delays in our service as a result of a variety of factors could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business.\nThe availability of our platform could be interrupted by a number of factors, including disaster events at our hosting facilities, our customers\u2019 inability to access the Internet, the failure of our network or software systems due to human or other error, security breaches or inability of the infrastructure to handle spikes in customer usage. We may be required to issue credits or refunds or indemnify or otherwise be liable to customers or third parties for damages that may occur resulting from certain of these events. In December 2013, we experienced a hosting outage, which impacted several of our U.S. customers for up to 11.5 hours, as well as shorter outages in March 2014 and April 2015. Additionally, in November 2015, we experienced a hosting outage which resulted in varying periods of downtime during an approximately nine hour time period affecting several of our U.S. customers. As a result of these outages, we provided service credits to certain customers. Service credits provided to date have not been material, both individually and in the aggregate. If we experience similar outages in the future, we may experience customer dissatisfaction, the termination of customer contracts, potential contract liability and potential loss of confidence, which could harm our reputation and impact future revenues from these customers.\nA rapid expansion of our business could cause our network or systems to fail.\nIn the future, we may need to expand our hosting operations at a more rapid pace than we have in the past, spend substantial amounts to purchase or lease data centers and equipment, upgrade our technology and infrastructure to handle increased customer demand and introduce new solutions. For example, if we secure a large customer or a group of customers which require significant amounts of bandwidth, storage or computing power to enable their communities, we may need to increase bandwidth, storage, server deployments, electrical power or other elements of our hosting operations and our existing systems may not be able to scale in a manner satisfactory to our existing or prospective customers.\nIf our internal or third-party vendors\u2019 security measures are breached or unauthorized access to customer data is otherwise obtained, our solutions may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our solutions and we may incur significant liabilities.\nOur hosting operations involve the storage and transmission of customer data. In certain circumstances, we use third-party providers to assist in these operations for certain lines of our business. Security breaches or unauthorized access to customer data that we, or our third-party hosting providers, host could result in the misuse or loss of this information, litigation, indemnity obligations, regulatory fines and penalties and other liabilities.\nMany of our customer and partner contracts provide that we assume full responsibility and will indemnify our customers for data privacy or security breaches or unauthorized access of customer data. If such a breach occurs, we could face contractual damages, damages and fees arising from our indemnification obligations, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, possible lawsuits by affected individuals and significant remediation costs and efforts to prevent future occurrences. In addition, whether there is an actual or a perceived breach of our security, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed significantly and we could lose current or potential customers. These risks increase as the adoption of our cloud-based products by enterprise customers increase.\nWhile we and our third-party vendors have security measures in place, these systems and networks are subject to ongoing threats and, therefore, these security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including cyber attacks or other intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, failure to implement appropriate processes and procedures, malfeasance or otherwise. The frequency, severity, sophistication and public awareness of these cyber attacks or other intentional misconduct by computer hackers increased in recent years. If any such security breaches were to occur, it could result in one or more third parties obtaining unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including personally identifiable information, information covered by HIPAA, intellectual property and other confidential business information. Third parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including intellectual property and other confidential business information.\nOur hosting, support and professional services personnel sometimes must access customer communities to fulfill our contractual obligations to provide these services to our customers. This access may result in exposure to confidential customer data and personally-identifiable information that is stored within our platform. If our personnel or our software systems were to permit unauthorized loss or access to this data by a third party, our reputation could be damaged and we could incur significant liability.\nAs described above, some of our lines of business rely on certain third-party service providers to host and deliver services and data, and any interruptions or delays in these hosted services, any security or privacy breaches, or any failures in data collection could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation. A security incident at any third-party hosting facility may compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of customer data.\nAdditionally, while our platform is not intended for the transmission or storage of credit card data, sensitive health, personal account or financial information and we contractually prohibit our customers from doing so, neither we nor our suppliers monitor or review the content that our customers upload and store within their communities. Therefore, we have no direct control over the substance or use of the content within our hosted communities. If customers use our platform for the transmission or storage of sensitive health, credit card, personal account or financial information and our security measures are breached our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability as many domestic and international laws place a higher burden of care on organizations that transmit and process this type of information.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, to implement adequate preventative or mitigation measures or to detect any such security breaches in a timely manner. If an actual or perceived breach of our, or our third-party vendors, security occurs, it could negatively impact our ability to attract new customers and increase engagement by existing customers, cause existing customers to elect to not renew their subscriptions, subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, thereby harming our reputation and our operating results.\nIn addition, through the APIs we make available to our customers and technology partners and through our add-on modules we deliver our customers may obtain third-party applications which access the data stored within their community. Because we do not control the transmissions between our customers and these third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal and financial liability and negatively impact our future sales.\nBecause our platform could be used to collect and store personal information of our customers\u2019 employees or customers, privacy concerns could result in additional cost and liability to us or inhibit sales of our platform.\nPersonal privacy has become a significant issue in the United States and in many other countries where we offer our solutions. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Many federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, disclosure, control and deletion of personal information. In the United States, these include, without limitation, rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, HIPAA and state breach notification laws. Internationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security\nand privacy legal framework with which we and our customers must comply. These obligations include, for example, the Data Protection Directive established in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), European Directive 2002/58/EC (commonly known as the \u201cEU Cookie Law\u201d), laws and regulations of EU member states, such as the German Federal Data Protection Act, and the Personal Data Protection Ordinance promulgated in Hong Kong. Many of these obligations are frequently modified or updated and require ongoing supervision. For example, with regard to transfers of personal data, as such term is used in the EU Data Protection Directive and applicable EU member state legislation, from our employees and European customers to the United States, we historically have relied upon adherence to the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Safe Harbor Privacy Principles and compliance with the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks agreed to by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union and Switzerland. The U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework, which, together with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, established means for legitimizing the transfer of personal data by U.S. companies from the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d), to the United States, was invalidated in October 2015 by a decision of the European Court of Justice (the \u201cECJ Ruling\u201d). As a result of the ECJ Ruling, the Swiss data protection regulator has questioned the status of the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework. In light of these events, we anticipate engaging in measures designed to legitimize our transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United States, and may find it necessary or desirable to make other changes to our personal data handling. U.S. and EU authorities reached a political agreement on February 2, 2016 regarding a new potential means for legitimizing personal data transfers from the EEA to the United States, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, but it is unclear whether the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield will be formally implemented and whether the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield will serve as an appropriate means for us to legitimize personal data transfers from the EEA to the United States. We may be unsuccessful in establishing legitimate means for our transfer of personal data from the EEA or otherwise responding to the ECJ Ruling, and we may experience reluctance or refusal by current or prospective European customers to use our solutions. Our response to the ECJ Ruling may cause us to assume additional liabilities or incur additional expenses for implementing compliance requirements, and the ECJ Ruling and our response could adversely affect our billings. Additionally, we and our customers may face a risk of enforcement actions by data protection authorities in the EEA until the time, if any, that personal data transfers to us and by us from the EEA are legitimized under applicable EU data protection law.\nIn addition to government regulation, privacy advocacy and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us. Because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws, regulations and standards are uncertain, it is possible that these laws, regulations and standards may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data management practices or the technological features of our solutions. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, investigations, lawsuits and other claims and proceedings, it may be necessary or desirable for us to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our software, which could have an adverse effect on our business. We may be unable to make such changes or modifications in a commercially reasonable manner or at all. Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or any actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations, standards and policies, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and harm our business.\nFurthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, standards and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our platform. Privacy concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our platform particularly in certain industries and foreign countries.\nFor instance, the recent publicity in the United States and abroad regarding the alleged surveillance activities of the NSA may cause our current and prospective customers to require additional information regarding our data disclosure policies which may elongate our sales cycles, require us to make additional contractual commitments, assume additional liabilities and adversely affect our billings.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service or adequately address competitive challenges.\nWe have experienced significant growth in recent periods. For example, we have grown from 527 employees at December 31, 2012 to 721 at December 31, 2015 and we have acquired six companies since January 2011. This growth has placed, and any future growth may place, a significant strain on our management and operational infrastructure, including our hosting operations and enterprise resource planning system. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage these changes effectively. We will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures, which may include the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system in the future. Failure to effectively manage growth could result in declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, difficulties in introducing new features or other operational difficulties. Any failure to effectively manage growth could adversely impact our business and reputation.\nChanges in laws and/or regulations related to the Internet or related to privacy and data security concerns or changes in the Internet infrastructure itself may cause our business to suffer.\nThe future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the Internet as a primary medium for commerce, communication and business applications. Federal, state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting data privacy and the transmission of certain types of content using the Internet. For example, the State of California has adopted legislation requiring operators of commercial websites and mobile applications that collect personal information from California residents to conspicuously post and comply with privacy policies that satisfy certain requirements. Several other U.S. states have adopted legislation requiring companies to protect the security of personal information that they collect from consumers over the Internet, and more states may adopt similar legislation in the future. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission has used its authority under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to bring actions against companies for failing to maintain adequate security for personal information collected from consumers over the Internet and for failing to comply with privacy-related representations made to Internet users. The U.S. Congress has at various times proposed federal legislation intended to protect the privacy of Internet users and the security of personal information collected from Internet users that would impose additional compliance burdens upon companies collecting personal information from Internet users, and the U.S. Congress may adopt such legislation in the future. The EU also has adopted various directives regulating data privacy and security and the transmission of content using the Internet involving residents of the EU, including those directives known as the Data Protection Directive, the E-Privacy Directive, and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive, and may adopt similar directives in the future. The European Commission is currently considering a data protection regulation that may include operational requirements for companies that receive personal data that are different than those currently in place in the EU, and that may also include significant penalties for non-compliance. Additionally, various EU member states have passed legislation addressing data privacy and security, such as the German Federal Data Protection Act. Several other countries, including Canada and several Latin American and Asian countries, have constitutional protections for, or have adopted legislation protecting, individuals\u2019 personal information. Additionally, some federal, state, or foreign governmental bodies have established laws which seek to censor the transmission of certain types of content over the Internet or require that individuals be provided with the ability to permanently delete all electronic personal information, such as the German Multimedia Law of 1997.\nGiven the variety of global privacy and data protection regimes, as well as their uncertain interpretation and application, it is possible we may find ourselves subject to inconsistent obligations. For instance, the USA Patriot Act is considered by some to be in conflict with certain directives of the EU. Situations such as these require that we make prospective determinations regarding compliance with conflicting regulations. Increased enforcement of existing laws and regulations, as well as any laws, regulations or changes that may be adopted or implemented in the future, could limit the growth of the use of public cloud applications or communications generally, result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based applications such as our public cloud solutions, require implementation of additional technological safeguards and reduce the demand for our enterprise collaboration software platform. Additionally, due to the complexity and diversity of these laws, our customers often include contractual obligations which can impose significant risk of termination and financial penalties if we fail to comply.\nIf we are not able to develop and introduce enhancements and new features that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with technological developments, our business could be harmed.\nWe operate in a dynamic environment characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry and legal standards. The introduction of new enterprise collaboration software products by our competitors or new market entrants, the market acceptance of solutions or products based on new or alternative technologies, or the emergence of new industry standards could affect our ability to compete or potentially render our platform obsolete. Our ability to compete successfully, attract new customers and increase revenues from existing customers depends in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing enterprise collaboration software platform and to continually introduce or acquire new features that are in demand by the market we serve. The success of any enhancement or new solution depends on several factors, including timely completion and integration, adequate quality testing, introduction and market acceptance. Any new platform or feature that we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, may contain defects or may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues. If we are unable to anticipate or timely and successfully develop or acquire new offerings or features or enhance our existing platform to meet customer requirements, our business and operating results will be adversely affected. Additionally, for technologies that are acquired, we may not be able to successfully integrate or monetize the acquired technology at a rate that is consistent with the market\u2019s expectations.\nOur platform must integrate with a variety of operating systems, software applications and hardware that are developed by others and, if we are unable to devote the necessary resources to ensure that our solutions interoperate with such software and hardware, we may fail to increase, or we may lose, market share and we may experience a weakening demand for our platform.\nOur enterprise collaboration software platform must integrate with a variety of network, hardware and software platforms and cloud-based product suites, including Microsoft Office, and we need to continuously modify and enhance our platform to adapt to changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. Any failure of our solutions to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our platform, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. If we are unable to respond in a timely manner to these changes in a cost-effective manner, our solutions may become less marketable and less competitive or obsolete and our operating results may be negatively impacted. In addition, an increasing number of individuals within the enterprise are utilizing devices other than personal computers, such as mobile phones and other handheld devices, to access the Internet and corporate resources and conduct business. If we cannot effectively make our platform available on these mobile devices, we may experience difficulty attracting and retaining customers.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a single software platform.\nWe have historically derived a substantial portion of our total revenues from sales of a single software platform, the Jive Platform, and related modules. As such, any factor adversely affecting sales of this platform, including product release cycles, market acceptance, product competition, performance and reliability, reputation, price competition, and economic and market conditions, could harm our business and operating results.\nOur business could be adversely affected if our customers are not satisfied with our implementation, customization or other professional services we provide.\nOur business depends on our ability to satisfy our customers and meet our customers\u2019 business needs. If a customer is not satisfied with the type of solutions and professional services we or our partners deliver, we could incur additional costs to remedy the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer\u2019s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional services from that customer or our ability to renew that customer\u2019s subscription in subsequent periods. If we are not able to accurately estimate the cost of services requested by the customer, it might result in providing services on a discounted basis or free of charge until customer satisfaction is achieved. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. Further, we have customer payment obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already delivered. These customer obligations are typically not cancelable, but will not yield the expected revenues and cash flow if the customer defaults and fails to pay amounts owed, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nAdditionally, large enterprises may request or require customized features and functions unique to their particular business processes. If prospective large customers require customized features or functions that we do not offer, then the market for our platform will be more limited and our business could suffer. If a large enterprise contract requires customized features and functions, we cannot recognize any revenue related to the contract until the customized features and functions have been delivered to the customer. In addition, supporting large enterprise customers could require us to devote significant development services and support personnel and strain our personnel resources and infrastructure. If we are unable to address the needs of these customers in a timely fashion or further develop and enhance our platform, these customers may not renew their subscriptions, seek to terminate their relationship, renew on less favorable terms or fail to purchase additional features. If any of these were to occur, our revenues and billings may decline and we may not realize significantly improved operating results.\nWe might experience significant errors or security flaws in our platform.\nDespite testing prior to their release, software products frequently contain undetected errors, defects or security vulnerabilities, especially when initially introduced or when new versions are released. Errors in our products could affect the ability of our products to interoperate with other hardware or software products, impact functionality and delay the development or release of new solutions or new versions of solutions and adversely affect market acceptance of our products. The detection and correction of any bugs or security flaws can be time consuming and costly. Some errors in our platform and related solutions may only be discovered after installation and use by customers. Any errors, defects or security vulnerabilities discovered after commercial release or contained in custom implementations could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customers or increased service and warranty cost, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our products have contained and may contain undetected errors, defects or security vulnerabilities that could result in data unavailability, data security breaches, data loss or corruption or other harm to our customers. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that could attack our solutions, result in unauthorized access to customer data, or fraudulently induce individuals to provide their log-in credentials. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could result in contractual or regulatory liability, harm our reputation and lead some customers to cancel subscriptions, reduce or delay future purchases or use competitive solutions.\nFailure to adequately expand and retain our direct sales force will impede our growth.\nWe will need to continue to expand and optimize our sales and marketing infrastructure in order to grow our customer base and our business. We plan to continue to invest in our direct sales force, both domestically and internationally. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them requires significant time, expense and attention. It can take nine to 12 months or longer before our new sales representatives are fully trained and productive. Our business may be harmed if our efforts to expand and train our direct sales force do not generate a corresponding significant increase in billings and revenues. In particular, if we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel or if new direct sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of this investment or increase our billings and revenues or grow our business.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties.\nOur future growth may depend on our ability to enter into successful strategic relationships with third parties. For example, we are investing resources in building our indirect sales channel by establishing relationships with third parties to facilitate incremental sales and to implement and customize our platform. In addition, we are also establishing relationships with other third parties to develop integrations with compatible technology and content. These relationships may not result in additional customers or enable us to generate significant billings or revenues. Identifying partners as well as negotiating and documenting relationships with them requires significant time and resources. Our agreements for these relationships are typically non-exclusive and do not prohibit the other party from working with our competitors or from offering competing services. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues and billings could be impaired and our operating results would suffer. In particular, leveraging third-party reseller and referral partner relationships is currently our main strategy to build our presence in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. If these relationships are not successful it could impede our growth in revenues and billings.\nOur use of open source technology could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products.\nOur products contain software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under \u201copen source\u201d licenses. Use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. Some open source licenses contain provisions that require attribution or that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software used. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public at no cost. This would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in an adverse impact upon our intellectual property rights and ability to commercialize our products.\nAlthough we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products will be effective. If we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our products, to discontinue the sale of our products if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe, or our customers, may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement or misuse of their intellectual property.\nThe software industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property and proprietary rights. Recently, a number of large software, technology and social networking companies have become active in initiating litigation against competitors and other third parties for misuse of these rights. Additionally, within the United States in particular, non-practicing entities have significantly increased their activities of pursuing patent litigation against technology companies and their customers. As a result, technology and software companies are increasingly required to defend against litigation claims that are based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. As a result, our success depends upon our not infringing upon or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of others. Our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own confidential information or certain intellectual property. In addition, as we continue to expand globally, we may need to increase our headcount and, in doing so, we may hire individuals from competing industries and companies. While we have implemented procedures designed to ensure that we do not receive confidential\ninformation from third parties in such situations third parties may believe that their former employees may misuse confidential information obtained during their previous employment which may lead to an increased risk of litigation related to claims of misuse or unauthorized use of such competitors\u2019 proprietary information.\nFrom time to time, third parties have claimed, and may claim, that we infringe upon or have misappropriated their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon or misappropriating such rights. In the future, we, or our customers, may be the subject of claims that our platform, underlying technology or our actions in connection therewith infringe, misappropriate or violate the intellectual property rights of others. As a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. Any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our solutions, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. Even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and harm our business and operating results. As most of our customer and partner agreements obligate us to provide indemnification in connection with any such litigation and to obtain licenses, modify our platform, or refund fees, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, requested to indemnify our customers and business partners which could expose us to significant legal and financial liability. We expect that the occurrence of infringement claims is likely to grow as the market for enterprise collaboration software grows. Accordingly, our exposure to damages resulting from infringement claims could be increased and this could further exhaust our financial and management resources.\nThe outcome of any litigation, regardless of its merits, is inherently uncertain. Any intellectual property claim or lawsuit could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan and require us to change our technology, change our business practices and/or pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. In addition, in certain circumstances, such as those in which the opposing parties are large and well-funded companies, we may face a more expensive and protracted path to resolution of such claims or lawsuits.\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part upon our intellectual property. We primarily rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions with our employees, customers, partners and others to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate or we may be unable to secure intellectual property protection for all of our solutions. In particular, we have only recently begun to implement a strategy to seek patent protection for our technology.\nMoreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful, but we cannot be sure these actions will be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business and operating results might be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense and the diversion of management resources. Any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. Any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties.\nFurthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Effective protection of our intellectual property may not be available to us in every country in which our solutions are available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nAdditionally, in the United States, the central provisions of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA) became effective on March 16, 2013. Among other things, this law has switched U.S. patent rights from prior \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to the present \u201cfirst inventor-to-file\u201d system. This may result in inventors and companies having to file patent applications more frequently to preserve rights in their inventions. This may favor larger competitors that have the resources to file more patent applications.\nWe might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, and could ultimately result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property.\nAdverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for information technology. In addition, the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources. Weak global economic conditions, or a reduction in information technology spending even if economic conditions improve, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty remains, trends in information technology spending also remain unpredictable and subject to reductions due to credit constraints and uncertainties about the future. Unfavorable economic conditions could adversely affect, our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise collaboration software platform, and could delay prospective customers\u2019 purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions, or affect renewal rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in demand may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Palo Alto, California, a high portion of our technology and services personnel are located in our Portland, Oregon office. The West Coast, and California in particular, are active earthquake zones. Additionally, we rely on our network and third-party infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems and our website for our development, marketing, operational, support, hosted services and sales activities. In the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event such as fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, cyber attack, war or terrorist attack, we may be unable to continue our corporate operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, contractual and financial liabilities, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data, all of which could harm our future operating results.\nAlthough we back up customer data stored on our systems at least daily to a geographically distinct location, the data is not mirrored in real-time to this site. Thus, in the event of a physical disaster, or certain other failures of our computing infrastructure, customer data from very recent transactions may be permanently lost. Further, our full production infrastructure is not mirrored to a geographically distinct location and thus in the event of a disaster, production capacity may be impacted for an extended amount of time while the infrastructure is procured and rebuilt and data is restored.\nWe might require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new solutions or enhance our existing solutions, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nThe forecasts of market growth included in this document may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the markets in which we compete achieve the forecasted growth, we cannot assure you our business will grow at similar rates, if at all.\nGrowth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates which may not prove to be accurate. Forecasts relating to the expected growth in the enterprise collaboration software market and other markets may prove to be inaccurate. Even if these markets experience the forecasted growth, we may not grow our business at similar rates, or at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties.\nThere are limitations on the effectiveness of controls and the failure of our control systems may materially and adversely impact us.\nWe do not expect that disclosure controls or internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially and adversely impact us.\nThe intended operational and tax benefits of our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements depend on the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions and how we operate our business, and may be challenged by tax authorities.\nOur corporate structure and intercompany agreements with our foreign subsidiaries are intended to optimize our operating structure and our worldwide effective tax rate, including the manner in which we develop and use our intellectual property, manage our cash flow, and the pricing of our intercompany transactions. Our foreign subsidiaries operate under cost plus transfer pricing agreements with us. These agreements provide for sales, support and development activities for our benefit. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing technology or our transfer pricing arrangements, or determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax objectives, which could increase our international tax exposure and harm our operating results. For example, from May 2012 through June 30, 2013, we were under a United States federal tax examination for the tax years ending December 31, 2010 and 2011. Such examinations ended on June 13, 2013 and did not have a material financial impact. Further, from August 2014 through December 2014, we were under examination in Israel for the years ending December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The examination officially concluded as of December 26, 2014 and did not have a material financial impact.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders.\nIf a proxy contest with respect to election of our directors is initiated in the future by any activist stockholder, or if other activist stockholder activities occur, our business could be adversely affected because:\n\u2022\nresponding to a proxy contest and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees;\n\u2022\nperceived uncertainties as to our future direction caused by activist activities may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners; and\n\u2022\nif individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plans.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market on which our common stock trades and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly now that we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the recently enacted Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results. Although we have already hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nBecause we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we are subject to the independent auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, enhanced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. While we were able to determine in our management\u2019s report for fiscal 2015 that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, as well as provide an unqualified attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm to that effect, we have and will\ncontinue to consume management resources and incur significant expenses for Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. In the event that our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, or independent registered public accounting firm determines in the future that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under Section 404, we could be subject to one or more investigations or enforcement actions by state or federal regulatory agencies, stockholder lawsuits or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs, pay fines, settlements or judgments and causing investor perceptions to be adversely affected and potentially resulting in a decline in the market price of our stock.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nWe also expect that the combination of being a public company and the existence of these new rules and regulations will make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers as well as qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee and Compensation Committee.\nWe may acquire or invest in other companies or technologies in the future, which could divert management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, increase expenses, disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, acquire or invest in other businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We cannot assure you that we will realize the anticipated benefits of our past acquisitions or any future acquisition. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses related to identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated.\nThere are inherent risks in integrating and managing acquisitions. If we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to assimilate or integrate the acquired personnel, operations and technologies successfully or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022\nincurrence of acquisition-related costs, which would be recognized as a current period expense;\n\u2022\ninability to generate sufficient revenues to offset acquisition or investment costs;\n\u2022\nthe inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our platform and of maintaining quality standards consistent with our brand;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in incorporating new people;\n\u2022\ndelays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe need to implement additional controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, the challenges associated with currency and regulatory risks;\n\u2022\nchallenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences;\n\u2022\nharm to our existing business relationships with business partners and customers as a result of the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees;\n\u2022\nuse of resources that are needed in other parts of our business;\n\u2022\nthe inability to recognize acquired revenues in accordance with our revenue recognition policies, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue; and\n\u2022\nuse of substantial portions of our available cash or the incurrence of debt to consummate the acquisition.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. Also, contingent considerations related to acquisitions will be remeasured to fair value at each reporting period, with any changes in the value recorded as income or expense. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on the impairment assessment process, which could harm our results of operations.\nAcquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business and financial condition may suffer.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires us to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. We have consumed and will continue to consume management resources and incur expenses for this compliance on an ongoing basis. Additionally, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our auditors are unable to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nRisk Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation.\nThe trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nvariations in our billings, renewal rates, operating results, cash flow, loss per share and how these results compare to analyst expectations;\n\u2022\nthe net increase in the number of customers acquired, either independently or as compared with published expectations of analysts that cover us;\n\u2022\nforward looking guidance on billings, revenues, cash flows and loss per share;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new products or services, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in our public cloud service;\n\u2022\nchanges in the executive management team;\n\u2022\nthe economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry, and the industries of our customers; and\n\u2022\nany other factors discussed herein.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks, especially social media related stocks, or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price for our stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry, even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been subject of securities litigation. If we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our president, our secretary, or a majority vote of our board of directors, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our amended and restated bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquiror to affect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend the bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquiror to amend the bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time.", "PERMNO": 13160, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "JIVE"}
