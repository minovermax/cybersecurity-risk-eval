This is not an exhaustive list, and additional factors could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. This discussion of risk factors may include forward-looking statements. For cautions about relying on such forward-looking statements, please refer to the section entitled \u201cSafe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K immediately prior to Item 1.\nThe Company\u2019s Business May Be Adversely Affected By Conditions In The Financial Markets and Economic Conditions Generally\nIn recent years, economic growth and business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the United States has been slow and uneven. There can be no assurance that economic conditions will continue to improve, and these conditions could worsen. In addition, declining oil prices, monetary policy decisions, international economic conditions, and the level of U.S. debt may have a destabilizing effect on financial markets.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services the Company offers, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Company operates.\nOverall, during recent years, the business environment has been adverse for many households and businesses in the United States and worldwide. While economic conditions have shown signs of improvement, there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue. Economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and savings habits. Such conditions could have a material adverse effect on the credit quality of the Company\u2019s loans and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nThe Company may have difficulty managing its growth which may divert resources and limit the Company\u2019s ability to successfully expand its operations.\nThe Company has grown since it began operations in March 2004. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $732.0 million in total assets, $589.5 million in net loans and $598.2 million in deposits. The Company\u2019s future success will depend on the ability of its officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve its operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, and manage a growing number of customer relationships. The Company\u2019s future level of profitability will depend in part on its continued ability to grow; however, the Company may not be able to sustain its historical growth rate or even be able to grow at all, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nIf the Company cannot attract deposits, its growth may be inhibited.\nThe Company plans to increase the level of its assets, including its loan portfolio. The Company\u2019s ability to increase its assets depends in large part on its ability to attract additional deposits at competitive rates. The Company intends to seek additional deposits by continuing to establish and strengthen its personal relationships with its customers and by offering deposit products that are competitive with those offered by other financial institutions in its markets. The Company cannot ensure that these efforts will be successful. The Company\u2019s inability to attract additional deposits at competitive rates could have a material and adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nOur 20 largest deposit clients account for 28.83% of our core deposits.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our 20 largest bank depositors accounted for, in the aggregate, 28.83% of our core deposits, which we define to include non-interest bearing demand deposits, interest bearing demand deposits and money market deposits and savings. As a result, a material decrease in the volume of those deposits by a relatively small number of our depositors could reduce our liquidity, in which event it could became necessary for us to replace those deposits with higher-cost deposits, lower-yielding securities or FHLB borrowings, which would adversely affect our net interest income and, therefore, our results of operations.\nThe Company relies heavily on its senior management team and other employees, the loss of whom could significantly harm its business.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends heavily on the abilities and continued service of its executive officers, especially Alan I. Rothenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jason P. DiNapoli, President and Chief Operating Officer, Bradley S. Satenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and J. Kevin Sampson, Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer. These four individuals are integral to implementing the Company\u2019s business plan. If the Company loses the services of any of these executive officers, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price may be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, attracting suitable replacements may be difficult and may require significant management time and resources.\nThe Company also relies to a significant degree on the abilities and continued service of our deposit generating, lending, administrative, operational, accounting and financial reporting, compliance, marketing and technical personnel. Competition for qualified employees in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of, and experience in, the California independent banking industry. The process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out the Company\u2019s strategies is often lengthy. If the Company fails to attract and retain the necessary deposit generating, lending, administrative, operational, accounting and financial reporting, marketing and technical personnel, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf the Company\u2019s underwriting practices are not effective, the Company may suffer losses in its loan portfolio and its results of operations may be affected.\nThe Company seeks to mitigate the risks inherent in its loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting practices. Depending on the type of loan, these practices include analysis of a borrower\u2019s prior credit history, financial statements, tax returns and cash flow projections, valuation of collateral based on reports of independent appraisers and verification of liquid assets. If the Company\u2019s underwriting criteria prove to be ineffective, the Company may incur losses in its loan portfolio, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nA significant source of risk arises from the possibility that losses could be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans. The underwriting and credit monitoring policies and procedures that the Company has adopted to address this risk may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price. Unexpected losses may arise for a wide variety of reasons, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s ability to predict, influence or control. Some of these reasons could include a renewed economic downturn in the State of California or the United States, a renewed decline in the state or national real estate market, wars and acts of terrorism, and natural disasters.\nIf the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses is inadequate to cover actual losses, the Company\u2019s financial results would be affected.\nLike all financial institutions, the Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable incurred loan losses. The Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price. The Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses reflects the Company\u2019s best estimate of the losses incurred in the existing loan portfolio at the relevant balance sheet date and is based on management\u2019s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio, which evaluation is based on historical loss experience, the loss experience of other financial institutions, and other significant factors. The determination of an appropriate level of loan loss allowance is an inherently difficult process and is based on numerous assumptions. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates that may be beyond the Company\u2019s control, and these losses may exceed current estimates. While the Company believes that its allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable incurred losses, the Company cannot assure that it will not increase the allowance for loan losses further or that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover probable incurred losses in any event. Future provisions for loan losses or losses in excess of the allowance for loan losses could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nSee discussion of the Company\u2019s nonperforming assets and allowance for loan losses in Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition.\u201d\nBank regulators may require the Company to increase its allowance for loan losses, which could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nBank regulators, as an integral part of their respective supervisory functions, periodically review the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses. The bank regulators may require the Company to increase its allowance for loan losses through additional provisioning or to recognize further loan charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from the Company\u2019s. Any increase in the allowance for loan losses or further loan charge-offs required by bank regulators could have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nThe Company\u2019s lending limit may adversely affect the Company\u2019s competitiveness.\nThe Company\u2019s regulatory lending limit as of December 31, 2015 to any one customer or related group of customers was approximately $11.1 million. The Company\u2019s lending limit is substantially smaller than those of most financial institutions with which it competes and it may affect the Company\u2019s ability to attract or maintain customers or to compete with other financial institutions. Moreover, to the extent that the Company incurs losses and does not obtain additional capital, the Company\u2019s lending limit, which depends upon the amount of its capital, will decrease, which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nWe may enter into new lines of business or offer new products and services which expose us to additional risk or which are not successful.\nWe may enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services as new opportunities arise or as our business strategy changes. New lines of business or new products or services may involve significant business, reputational or regulatory risk, including increased regulatory scrutiny. The success of these efforts depends on many factors, including the competitive landscape, market adoption and successful implementation. We may experience significant losses to the extent that we invest significant time and resources to a new line of business, product or service and it is not successful. There can be no assurance that we can successfully manage these risks and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to successfully execute our strategic plan may adversely affect our performance.\nOur financial performance and profitability depend on our ability to execute our corporate strategies. Our near-term business strategy includes pursuing organic growth within our geographic footprint within the markets we currently serve. We cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to be able to maintain our rate of growth at acceptable risk levels and upon acceptable terms, while managing the costs and implementation risks associated with our growth strategy. We may be unable to continue to increase our volume of loans and deposits or to introduce new products and services at acceptable risk levels for a variety of reasons, including an inability to maintain capital and liquidity sufficient to support continued growth. If we are successful in continuing our growth, we cannot assure you that further growth would offer the same levels of potential profitability, or that it would be successful in controlling costs and maintaining asset quality. Other factors that may adversely affect our ability to attain our long-term financial performance goals include an inability to control non-interest expense, including, but not limited to, rising employee compensation, regulatory compliance and healthcare costs, limitations imposed on us through regulatory actions, and our inability to increase net-interest income due to continued downward pressure on interest rates. Accordingly, an inability to maintain growth, or an inability to effectively manage growth, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nOur concentration of commercial real estate loans is subject to unique risks that could adversely affect our earnings.\nOur commercial real estate portfolio was $259.0 million at December 31, 2015 comprising 43.3% of total loans. Commercial real estate loans are often riskier and tend to have significantly larger balances than home equity loans or residential mortgage loans to individuals. While we believe that the commercial real estate concentration risk is mitigated by sound underwriting practices, and ongoing portfolio monitoring and market analysis, the repayments of these loans usually depends on the successful operation of a business or the sale of the underlying property. As a result, these loans are more likely to be unfavorably affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general.\nThe federal banking regulators have issued guidance for those institutions that are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Pursuant to the supervisory criteria contained in the guidance for identifying institutions with a potential commercial real estate concentration risk, institutions which have total commercial real estate loans representing 300% or more of the institution\u2019s total risk-based capital and the institution\u2019s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months are identified as having potential commercial real estate concentration risk. Institutions that are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending are expected to employ heightened levels of risk management with respect to their commercial real estate portfolios, and may be required to hold higher levels of capital. The Company, like many community banks, has a concentration in commercial real estate loans, and the Company has experienced significant growth in its commercial real estate portfolio in recent years. Commercial real estate loans represent 357.2% of total risk-based capital as of December 31, 2015. Management implemented heightened monitoring, reporting and risk management measures, but there can be no assurance that these enhanced concentration risk management systems will mitigate the increased risk. Although not currently anticipated, we may be required to maintain higher levels of capital than we would otherwise be expected to maintain as a result of our level of commercial real estate loans, which may require us to obtain additional capital sooner than we would otherwise seek it, which may reduce stockholder returns.\nOur concentration of construction loans is subject to unique risks that could adversely affect our earnings.\nOur construction loan portfolio, which includes land and construction loans, was $59.8 million at December 31, 2015 comprising 10.0% of total loans. Construction loans are often riskier and tend to have significantly larger balances than home equity loans or residential mortgage loans to individuals. Although we believe that the construction loan concentration risk is mitigated by sound underwriting practices, and ongoing portfolio monitoring and market analysis, the repayments of these loans usually depends on the successful operation of a business, ability of the borrower to obtain permanent financing, or the sale of the building or underlying property. As a result, these loans are more likely to be unfavorably affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general.\nOur concentration of commercial and industrial loans is subject to unique risks that could adversely affect our earnings.\nOur commercial and industrial loans portfolio was $112.9 million at December 31, 2015. Commercial and industrial loans comprise 18.9% of the total loan portfolio. These loans are collateralized by various business assets, the value of which may decline during adverse market and economic conditions. Adverse conditions in the real estate market and the economy generally may result in increasing levels of loan charge-offs and non-performing assets and the reduction of earnings. Additionally, if and when we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the related asset to the then-fair market value of the collateral, which may ultimately result in a loss and a reduction of earnings.\nThe Company faces strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services, and its failure to compete effectively with these companies could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nWithin the Los Angeles metropolitan area, the Company faces intense competition for loans, deposits, and other financial products and services. Increased competition within the Company\u2019s market may result in reduced loan originations and deposits. Ultimately, the Company may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Many competitors offer the types of loans and banking services that the Company offers. These competitors include national banks, regional banks and other independent banks. The Company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries. In particular, the Company\u2019s competitors include financial institutions whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions may have larger lending limits which would allow them to serve the credit needs of larger customers. These institutions, particularly to the extent they are more diversified than the Company, may be able to offer the same loan products and services the Company offers at more competitive rates and prices.\nThe Company also faces competition from out-of-state financial intermediaries that have opened loan production offices or that solicit deposits in the Company\u2019s market areas. If the Company is unable to attract and retain banking customers, it may be unable to continue its loan growth and level of deposits, and its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price may be materially adversely affected.\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches of our information security, and cyber-security attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects.\nAs a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us or our clients and that may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of confidential information belonging to us or personal or confidential information belonging to our clients, misappropriation of assets, litigation, or damage to our reputation. Fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check \u201ckiting\u201d or fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, \u201cphishing\u201d and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to data processing or data storage systems used by us or by our clients, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware or other cyber-attacks. We have been seeing increases in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, including in the commercial banking sector, as cyber-criminals have been targeting commercial bank and brokerage accounts on an increasing basis. Moreover, in recent periods, several large corporations, including financial service organizations and retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only their confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their clients or customers and their employees, and subjecting those corporations to potential fraudulent activity and their clients and customers to identity theft and fraudulent activity in their credit card and banking accounts. Therefore, security breaches and cyber-attacks can cause significant increases in operating costs, including the costs of compensating clients and customers for any resulting losses they may incur and the costs and capital expenditures required to correct the deficiencies in and strengthen the security of data processing and storage systems.\nAlthough we invest in systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and we conduct periodic tests of our security systems and processes, there is no assurance that we will succeed in anticipating or adequately protecting against or preventing all security breaches and cyber-attacks from occurring due to a number of possible causes, many of which will be outside of our control, including the changing nature and increasing frequency of such attacks, the increasing sophistication of cyber-criminals, and possible weaknesses that go undetected in our data systems notwithstanding the testing we conduct of those systems. If we are unable to detect or prevent a security breach or cyber-attack from occurring, then, we and our clients could incur losses or damages; and we could sustain damage to our reputation, lose clients and business, suffer disruptions to our business and incur increased operating costs, and be exposed to additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties and to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nThe Company relies on communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology from third-party service providers, and the Company may suffer an interruption in, security breach or break of those systems that may result in lost business and the Company may not be able to obtain substitute providers on terms that are as favorable if its relationships with its existing service providers are interrupted.\nThe Company relies heavily on third-party service providers for much of its communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology, including customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, and servicing, information technology monitoring and loan origination systems. The Company cannot assure that failures or interruptions in these systems will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed by it or the third parties on which the Company relies. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price. If any of the Company\u2019s third-party service providers experience financial, operational or technological difficulties, or if there is any other disruption in the Company\u2019s relationships with them, the Company may be required to locate alternative sources of such services, and the Company cannot assure that it could negotiate terms that are as favorable to the Company, or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in its existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources, if at all. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nThe Company may experience certain risks in connection with its online banking services that could adversely affect its business.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends in part upon the use of the internet and online services as a medium for banking and commerce by customers. The Company\u2019s inability to modify or adapt its infrastructure in a timely manner or the expenses incurred in making such adaptations could have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price. Additionally, any compromise in the secured transmission of confidential information over public networks could have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nOur network and information systems are important to our operating activities and any shutdown to our network and information systems could have a material adverse impact on our operating activities.\nOur network and information systems are important to our operating activities and any network and information system shutdowns could disrupt our ability to process loan applications, originate loans, service our existing loan portfolios, or service our deposit accounts, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating activities. Shutdowns may be caused by unforeseen catastrophic events, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, large-scale power outages, software or hardware defects, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors, difficulties in migrating technology facilities from one location to another, or other similar events.\nWe maintain and regularly assess a disaster recovery plan, but there can be no guarantees that our disaster recovery plan will mitigate or resolve the possible material adverse effects of a disaster.\nAlthough we maintain, and regularly assess the adequacy of, a disaster recovery plan designed to effectively manage the effects of unforeseen events, we cannot be certain that such plan will function as intended, or otherwise resolve or compensate for such effects. Such a failure of our disaster recovery plan, if and when experienced, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nChanges in economic conditions, and in particular the State of California and the United States, could have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s business is directly affected by factors such as economic, political and market conditions, broad trends in industry and finance, legislative and regulatory changes, changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies and inflation, all of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The Company is particularly susceptible to conditions and changes affecting the State of California and Southern California in particular in view of the concentration of its operations and collateral securing, and likely to secure its loan portfolio in Southern California. The deterioration in economic conditions, in California and Southern California in particular, may have the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price:\n\u25cf\nRenewed increases in problem assets and foreclosures.\n\u25cf\nRenewed increases in loan delinquencies.\n\u25cf\nDecline in demand for loans and other products and services.\n\u25cf\nDeposits may decrease.\n\u25cf\nCollateral for loans made by the Company, especially real estate, may experience declines in value, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power or capacity to repay, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with the Company\u2019s existing loans.\nIn addition, because the Company makes loans to small to medium-sized businesses, many of the Company\u2019s customers may be particularly susceptible to the slow recovery from the recession and may be unable to make scheduled principal or interest payments during similar periods of recession.\nThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision\nThe Company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors' funds, consumers, and the banking system as a whole, not stockholders. These regulations affect the Company's lending practices, capital structure, investment practices and growth. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector. Other changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, and shifts in regulatory scrutiny during the examination process, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject the Company to additional costs, other compliance burdens, limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things.\nWe are also subject to numerous other laws and government regulations that are applicable to banks and other financial institutions, which include but are not limited to various consumer protection and fair lending laws, the BSA, the USA PATRIOT ACT of 2001, and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, and increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.\nFailure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in private rights of action (and class actions) or sanctions by regulatory agencies, such as cease and desist orders, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nMany of the Company\u2019s loans are secured by real estate, and an additional downturn in the real estate market could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nA renewed downturn in the real estate market may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business because many of the Company\u2019s loans are secured by real estate. At December 31, 2015, approximately 83.7% of the Company\u2019s total loans were secured by real estate. Real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by changes in national, regional or local economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates, the availability of loans to potential purchasers, changes in tax laws and other laws, regulations and policies and war and acts of terrorism. In addition, real estate values in California could be affected by, among other things, earthquakes, droughts, wildfires, floods, mudslides and other national disasters particular to the state. When real estate prices decline, the value of real estate collateral securing the Company\u2019s loans is reduced. As a result, the Company may experience greater charge-offs and, similarly, its ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral may be diminished and as a result the Company is more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans, which would have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nOur real estate lending also exposes us to the risk of environmental liabilities.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third persons for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or we may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. If we ever become subject to environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we may not have adequate remedies against prior owners or other responsible parties or could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties, which could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nA natural disaster, especially in California, could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nHistorically, Southern California has been vulnerable to natural disasters. Therefore, the Company is susceptible to the risks of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, droughts, wildfires, floods and mudslides. Natural disasters could harm the Company\u2019s operations directly through interference with communications, as well as through the destruction of facilities and its operational, financial and management information systems. Uninsured or underinsured disasters may reduce a borrower\u2019s ability to repay mortgage loans. Disasters may also reduce the value of the real estate securing the Company\u2019s loans, impairing its ability to recover on defaulted loans. The occurrence of natural disasters could impair the value of the real estate in those areas affected and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are concentrated in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.\nThe Company\u2019s loan and deposit activities are largely based in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. As a result, the Company\u2019s financial performance will depend largely upon economic conditions in this area. Adverse local economic conditions have caused and in the future may cause the Company to experience an increase in loan delinquencies, an increase in the number of borrowers who default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans, all of which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk.\nThe Company\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Open Market Committee. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest the Company receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of the Company\u2019s mortgage-backed securities portfolio. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, the Company\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be materially and adversely affected. Earnings could also be materially and adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nSee discussion of the Company\u2019s net interest income in Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations.\u201d\nThe Company may be materially and adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial institutions are inter-related as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. In the normal course of business, the Company executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers and correspondent banks. These transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty. On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews the counterparties\u2019 financial information, such as SEC filings, Call Reports and press releases, as well as any announcements made by appropriate industry regulators and government agencies, to monitor the counterparties\u2019 financial stability and/or any regulatory disciplinary actions imposed on such counterparties. At December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any unsecured federal funds sold with any correspondent banks. However, no assurance can be given that the Company will not be materially and adversely affected as a result of a negative occurrence, such as a default, at one of the financial institutions with which the Company transacts business.\nThe Company is subject to liquidity risk.\nThe Company requires liquidity to meet its deposit and debt obligations as they come due. The Company\u2019s main sources of funds to provide liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents, paydowns and maturities of investments, loan repayments, and increases in deposits and borrowings. The Company also maintains lines of credit with the FHLB and other correspondent financial institutions. The lines of credit are subject to conditions, including collateral requirements, that the Company may not be able to meet at the time when additional liquidity is needed.\nThe Company\u2019s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance its activities or on terms that are acceptable to it could be impaired by factors that affect it specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally. Factors that could reduce its access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the California economy, difficult credit markets or adverse regulatory actions against the Company. The Company\u2019s access to deposits may also be affected by the liquidity needs of its depositors. In particular, a substantial majority of the Company\u2019s liabilities are demand, savings, interest checking and money market deposits, which are payable on demand or upon several days\u2019 notice, while by comparison, a substantial portion of its assets are loans, which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame. The Company may not be able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary in the future, especially if a large number of its depositors sought to withdraw their accounts, regardless of the reason. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nThe Company may need to raise additional capital in the future, and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.\nThe Company may need to raise additional capital in the future to meet recent changes in the minimum capital requirements for banks or to provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its commitments and business needs, particularly if its asset quality or earnings were to deteriorate. The Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of its control, and its financial performance. Economic conditions and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase the Company\u2019s cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the FHLB.\nThe Company cannot ensure that such capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit the Company\u2019s access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, depositors of the Bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets may adversely affect the Company\u2019s capital costs and its ability to raise capital and, in turn, its liquidity. Moreover, if the Company needs to raise capital in the future, it may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may make it difficult for investors to resell shares of common stock at a time or price they find attractive.\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf\nActual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u25cf\nChanges in financial estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to us or other financial institutions;\n\u25cf\nReports in the press or investment community generally or relating to our reputation or the financial services industry;\n\u25cf\nStrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, restructurings, dispositions, or financings;\n\u25cf\nFluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nFuture sales of our equity or equity-related securities;\n\u25cf\nProposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;\n\u25cf\nAnticipated or pending investigations, proceedings, or litigation that may involve or affect us;\n\u25cf\nDomestic and international economic and political factors unrelated to our performance; and\n\u25cf\nGeneral market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our stock price, notwithstanding our operating results. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate and there can be no assurances about the levels of the market prices for our common stock.\nWe may not pay dividends on our common stock and our business is subject to certain restrictions on the payment of dividends.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We have not previously paid cash dividends on our common stock. It is our current intention to invest our cash flow and earnings in the growth of our businesses and, therefore, we have no plans to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any future determination relating to this dividend policy will be made by our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition and results of operations, tax considerations, capital requirements, industry standards, and economic conditions.\nFurther, as a bank holding company, our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including guidelines regarding capital adequacy and dividends. In addition, our ability to pay dividends depends primarily on our receipt of dividends from our bank, the payment of which is subject to numerous limitations under federal and state banking laws, regulations and policies.\nThe Company is incorporated in Delaware and is governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d). The DGCL allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under the DGCL or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under the DGCL, however, the Company cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after it pays the dividend, its capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Additionally, the FRB\u2019s policy regarding dividends provides that a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends exceeding its net income or which can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company\u2019s financial health, such as by borrowing.\nThe Bank\u2019s regulators have the authority to prohibit the payment of dividends, depending upon the Bank\u2019s financial condition, if such payment is deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. As a national bank, the Bank must obtain the prior approval of the OCC to pay a dividend if the total of all dividends declared by it in any calendar year would exceed its net income for the year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of any preferred stock. Currently, the Bank is prohibited from paying dividends to the Company until such time as its accumulated deficit is eliminated. As a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, we may not pay dividends on our common stock.\nThe volume of trading in our common stock has not been significant. As a result, stockholders may not be able to sell their common stock, particularly in large quantities.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on The NASDAQ CM and a number of brokers offer to make a market in our common stock, trading volume to date has been limited. There can be no assurance that a more active and liquid market for our common stock will develop or can be maintained. As a result, stockholders may find it difficult to sell a significant number of shares of our common stock at the prevailing market price.\nCertain banking laws and provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have an anti-takeover effect.\nProvisions of federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our stockholders. Acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company or depository institution, including shares of our common stock, generally creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer \u201ccontrols\u201d the bank holding company or depository institution. Also, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the FRB before, among other things, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank, including our bank. There also are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, such as limitations on the ability to call a special meeting of our stockholders, that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. In addition, our board of directors is authorized under our certificate of incorporation to issue shares of our preferred stock, and determine the rights, terms conditions and privileges of such preferred stock, without stockholder approval. These provisions may effectively inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit and is not guaranteed by the FDIC, so you could lose some or all of your investment.\nAn investment in our common stock is not a bank deposit and is not insured against loss or guaranteed by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. An investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described herein. As a result, if you acquire our common stock, you could lose some or all of your investment.\nThe internal controls that we have implemented in order to mitigate risks inherent to the business of banking might fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls and procedures over financial reporting that are designed to manage the various risks in our business, including credit risk, operational risk, and interest rate risk. No system of controls, however well-designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. If we fail to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, or if internal controls were circumvented, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 92870, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FCTY"}
