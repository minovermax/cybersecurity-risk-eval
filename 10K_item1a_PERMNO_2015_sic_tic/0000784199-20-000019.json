Risk Factors.\nRisks Relating To Our Business\nWe may not realize all the anticipated benefits of the JOTEC Acquisition.\nOn December 1, 2017 we acquired JOTEC AG, a Swiss entity that we converted to JOTEC GmbH and subsequently merged with our Swiss acquisition entity, Jolly Buyer Acquisition GmbH (\u201cJOTEC\u201d), and its subsidiaries (the \u201cJOTEC Acquisition\u201d) for $169.1 million in cash and 2,682,754 shares of CryoLife common stock with a value of $53.1 million on the date of closing, for a total purchase price of approximately $222.2 million, including debt and cash acquired on the date of closing. We paid part of the cash portion of the purchase price using available cash on hand and financed the remainder of the cash portion of the purchase price and related expenses and refinanced our then existing approximately $69.0 million term loan, with a new $255.0 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $225.0 million secured term loan facility and a $30.0 million undrawn secured revolving credit facility.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities, growth prospects, cost savings, synergies, and other benefits of the JOTEC Acquisition depends on a number of factors including:\n\uf0b7The continued growth of the global market for stent grafts used in endovascular and open repair of aortic disease;\n\uf0b7Our ability to leverage our global infrastructure to sell JOTEC products, including in the markets in which JOTEC is already direct;\n\uf0b7Our ability to foster cross-selling opportunities between the CryoLife and JOTEC product portfolios;\n\uf0b7Our ability to bring JOTEC products to the U.S. market;\n\uf0b7Our ability to harness the JOTEC new product pipeline and R&D capabilities to drive long-term growth, including our ability to obtain Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9ene Mark product certification (\u201cCE Mark\u201d) for pipeline products;\n\uf0b7Our ability to drive gross margin expansion;\n\uf0b7Our ability to compete effectively;\n\uf0b7Our ability to carry, service, and manage significantly more debt and repayment obligations; and\n\uf0b7Our ability to manage the unforeseen risks and uncertainties related to JOTEC\u2019s business, including any related to intellectual property rights.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenues, and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially, adversely impact our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all. Any of these factors could negatively impact our earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition, and negatively impact the price of our common stock. In addition, if we fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, we could experience an interruption or loss of momentum in our existing business activities, which could adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nOur current and future levels of indebtedness could:\n\uf0b7Limit our ability to borrow money for our working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, strategic initiatives, or other purposes;\n\uf0b7Require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes;\n\uf0b7Limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our operations or business;\n\uf0b7Make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, the economy, or the industry in which we operate;\n\uf0b7Restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, introducing new technologies, or exploiting business opportunities; and\n\uf0b7Expose us to the risk of increased interest rates as most of our borrowings are at a variable rate of interest.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain, and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours may contain, covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries, including (subject in each case to certain exceptions) restrictions or prohibitions on our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\uf0b7Incur or guarantee additional debt;\n\uf0b7Pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our share capital, including repurchasing or redeeming capital stock or make other restricted payments, including restricted junior payments;\n\uf0b7Enter into agreements that restrict our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends to us, repay debt owed to us or our subsidiaries, or make loans or advances to us or our other subsidiaries;\n\uf0b7Comply with certain financial ratios set forth in the agreement;\n\uf0b7Enter into any transaction or merger or consolidation, liquidation, winding-up, or dissolution; convey, sell, lease, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any part of our business, assets or property; or sell, assign, or otherwise dispose of any capital stock of any subsidiary;\n\uf0b7Create liens on certain assets;\n\uf0b7Enter into certain transactions with our affiliates;\n\uf0b7Enter into certain rate swap transactions, basis swaps, credit derivative transactions, and other similar transactions, whether relating to interest rates, commodities, investments, securities, currencies, or any other relevant measure, or transactions of any kind subject to any form of master purchase agreement governed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., any International Foreign Exchange Master Agreement, or any other master agreement;\n\uf0b7Amend, supplement, waive, or otherwise modify our organizational documents or the organizational documents of a subsidiary in a manner that would be materially adverse to the interests of the lenders, or change or amend the terms of documentation regarding junior financing in a manner that would be materially adverse to the interests of the lenders;\n\uf0b7Change our, or permit a subsidiary to change its, fiscal year without notice to the administrative agent under the agreement;\n\uf0b7Enter into agreements which restrict our ability to incur liens;\n\uf0b7Engage in any line of business substantially different from that in which we are currently engaged; and\n\uf0b7Make certain investments, including strategic acquisitions or joint ventures.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nWe have pledged substantially all of our U.S. assets as collateral under our existing Credit Agreement. If we default on the terms of such credit agreements and the holders of our indebtedness accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness.\nA failure to comply with the covenants contained in our existing Credit Agreement could result in an event of default under such agreements, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and profitability. In the event of any default under our existing debt agreement, the holders of our indebtedness:\n\uf0b7Will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;\n\uf0b7Could elect to declare all indebtedness outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit, if applicable; or\n\uf0b7Could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay such indebtedness.\nIf we are unable to repay those amounts, the holders of our secured indebtedness could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. If the indebtedness under our existing debt agreements were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full.\nOur charges to earnings resulting from acquisition, restructuring, and integration costs may materially, adversely affect the market value of our common stock.\nWe account for the completion of our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. We allocate the total estimated purchase prices to net tangible assets, amortizable intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the acquisitions, record the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. Our financial results, including earnings per share, could be adversely affected by a number of financial adjustments required in purchase accounting including the following:\n\uf0b7We will incur additional amortization expense over the estimated useful lives of some of the intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions during such estimated useful lives;\n\uf0b7We will incur additional depreciation expense as a result of recording purchased tangible assets;\n\uf0b7To the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets;\n\uf0b7Cost of sales may increase temporarily following an acquisition as a result of acquired inventory being recorded at its fair market value;\n\uf0b7Earnings may be affected by changes in estimates of future contingent consideration to be paid when an earn-out is part of the consideration; or\n\uf0b7Earnings may be affected by transaction and integration costs, which are expensed immediately.\nWe are significantly dependent on our revenues from tissue preservation services and are subject to a variety of risks affecting them.\nTissue preservation services are a significant source of our revenues, accounting for 29% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and 37% of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017. The following could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows, if we are unable to:\n\uf0b7Source sufficient quantities of some tissue types from human donors or address potential excess supply of other tissue types. We rely primarily upon the efforts of third-party procurement organizations, tissue banks (most of which are not-for-profit), and others to educate the public and foster a willingness to donate tissue. Factors beyond our control such as supply, regulatory changes, negative publicity concerning methods of tissue recovery or disease transmission from donated tissue, or public opinion of the donor process as well as our own reputation in the industry can negatively impact the supply of tissue;\n\uf0b7Compete effectively in tissue preservation services, as we may be unable to capitalize on our clinical advantage or our competitors may have advantages over us in terms of cost structure, pricing, back office automation, marketing, and sourcing tissue; or\n\uf0b7Mitigate sufficiently the risk that processed tissue cannot be sterilized and hence carries an inherent risk of infection or disease transmission; there is no assurance that our quality controls will be adequate to mitigate such risk.\nIn addition, U.S. and foreign governments and regulatory agencies have adopted restrictive laws, regulations, and rules that apply to our tissue preservation services. These include but are not limited to:\n\uf0b7National Organ Transplant Act, which prohibits the acquisition or transfer of human organs for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation, but allows for the payment of reasonable expenses associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, and storage of human organs; and\n\uf0b7U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requirements for prevention of occupational exposure to infectious agents and hazardous chemicals and protection of the environment.\nAny of these laws, regulations, and rules or others could change, our interpretation of them could be challenged by U.S., state, or foreign governments and regulatory agencies, or these governments and regulatory agencies could adopt more restrictive laws or regulations in the future regarding tissue preservation services that could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe are significantly dependent on our revenues from BioGlue and are subject to a variety of risks affecting them.\nBioGlue\u00ae Surgical Adhesive (\u201cBioGlue\u201d) is a significant source of our revenues, accounting for 25% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and 35% of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017. The following could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows:\n\uf0b7Our ability to achieve anticipated BioGlue revenue in the U.S. and in international markets outside the U.S.;\n\uf0b7BioGlue is a mature product, our U.S. Patent for BioGlue expired in mid-2012, and our patents in most of the rest of the world for BioGlue expired in mid-2013. Other companies may use the inventions disclosed in the expired patents to develop and make competing products;\n\uf0b7Some companies have launched competitive products and others may pursue regulatory approval for competitive products in the future. These companies may have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, and marketing resources than we do and may be better established in their markets;\n\uf0b7We may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals to commercialize BioGlue in certain countries other than the U.S. at the same rate as our competitors or at all. We also may not be able to capitalize on new regulatory approvals we obtain for BioGlue in countries other than the U.S., including approvals for new indications;\n\uf0b7BioGlue contains a bovine blood protein. Animal-based products are subject to increased scrutiny from the public and regulators, who may have concerns about the use of animal-based products or concerns about the transmission of disease from animals to humans. These concerns could lead to additional regulations or product bans in certain countries;\n\uf0b7Changes to components in the BioGlue product, including in the delivery system, require regulatory approval, which, if delayed, could cause prolonged disruptions to our ability to supply BioGlue; and\n\uf0b7On June 13, 2019 our European Notified Body for BioGlue, Lloyd\u2019s Register Quality Assurance Limited, which is headquartered in the U.K., informed us that it would no longer provide Notified Body services to companies in European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) effective September 2019. On July 5, 2019 the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (\u201cMHRA\u201d) granted us a one year grace period to transfer BioGlue (and PhotoFix) to a new Notified Body. We are currently in the process of transferring to a new Notified Body for BioGlue (and PhotoFix) in the EEA. If we are delayed or unsuccessful in transferring to a new Notified Body for BioGlue (and PhotoFix) in the EEA, or if we are otherwise unable to timely meet applicable regulatory requirements, we may be unable to place BioGlue (or PhotoFix) on the market in the EEA until the situation is resolved.\nWe are significantly dependent on our revenues from JOTEC and are subject to a variety of risks affecting them.\nJOTEC is now a significant source of our revenues, accounting for 24% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and 2% of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017. The following could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows:\n\uf0b7Our ability to achieve anticipated JOTEC revenue in international markets outside the U.S.;\n\uf0b7Our ability to meet demand for JOTEC products as we seek to expand our business globally;\n\uf0b7Our ability to compete effectively with our major competitors, as they may have advantages over us in terms of cost structure, supply chain, pricing, sales force footprint, and brand recognition;\n\uf0b7Our ability to develop innovative and in-demand products in the aortic surgery space;\n\uf0b7Our ability to contend with enhanced regulatory requirements and enforcement activities; and\n\uf0b7Our ability to maintain a productive working relationship with our Works Council in Germany.\nWe are significantly dependent on our revenues from On-X and are subject to a variety of risks affecting them.\nOn-X is a significant source of our revenues, accounting for 18%, 17%, and 19% of revenues in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The following could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows:\n\uf0b7Our ability to achieve anticipated On-X revenue in the U.S. and in international markets outside the U.S.;\n\uf0b7Our ability to capitalize on the FDA\u2019s approved reduced International Normalized Ratio (\u201cINR\u201d) indication;\n\uf0b7Our ability to compete effectively with some of our major competitors, as they may have advantages over us in terms of cost structure, supply chain, pricing, sales force footprint, and brand recognition;\n\uf0b7Our ability to manage the risks associated with less favorable contract terms for On-X products on consignment at hospitals with more bargaining power;\n\uf0b7Clinical trial data or changes in technology that may impact the market for mechanical heart valves, such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or \u201cTAVR\u201d devices;\n\uf0b7Enhanced regulatory enforcement activities or failure to receive renewed certifications that could cause interruption in our ability to sell On-X products in certain markets; and\n\uf0b7Our ability to execute and complete the FDA mandated post-approval study to assess the occurrence of adverse events with the On-X Aortic Prosthetic Heart Valve when targeted at an INR level of 1.8 (1.5-2.0 range) during a 5-year follow-up.\nOur products and tissues are highly regulated and subject to significant quality and regulatory risks.\nThe manufacture and sale of medical devices and processing, preservation, and distribution of human tissues are highly complex and subject to significant quality and regulatory risks in the U.S. and internationally. Any of the following could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows:\n\uf0b7Our products and tissues may be recalled or placed on hold by us, the FDA, or other regulatory bodies;\n\uf0b7Our products and tissues allegedly have caused, and may in the future cause, injury to patients, which has exposed, and could in the future expose, us to product and tissue processing liability claims, and such claims could lead to additional regulatory scrutiny and inspections;\n\uf0b7Our manufacturing and tissue processing operations are subject to regulatory scrutiny and inspections, including by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, and these agencies could require us to change or modify our manufacturing operations, processes, and procedures or take other adverse action. For example, in January 2013 we received a warning letter from the FDA related to the manufacture of our products and our processing, preservation, and distribution of human tissue, as well as a subsequent 2014 Form 483, after a FDA re-inspection related to the warning letter that included observations concerning design and process validations, environmental monitoring, product controls and handling, corrective and preventive actions, and employee training. After an FDA re-inspection in the first quarter of 2015, the FDA closed out the warning letter issued in 2013;\n\uf0b7Regulatory agencies could reclassify, reevaluate, or suspend our clearances and approvals, or fail, or decline to timely issue, or reissue, our clearances and approvals, that are necessary to sell our products and distribute tissues;\n\uf0b7Local and international regulatory and quality laws and standards are subject to change, which could adversely affect our clearances and approvals to sell our products and distribute tissues; and\n\uf0b7Adverse publicity associated with our products or processed tissues or our industry could lead to a decreased use of our products or tissues, additional regulatory scrutiny, and/or product or tissue processing liability lawsuits.\nFurther, on May 25, 2017, the European Union adopted a new Medical Device Regulation (MDR 2017/745) (\u201cMDR\u201d), which takes effect on May 26, 2020. Among other changes, MDR places more stringent requirements on manufacturers and European Notified Bodies regarding product classifications, pre- and post-market clinical studies, and other regulatory requirements for product clearances and approvals. These changes could result in product reclassifications and the imposition of other regulatory requirements that could delay, impede, or prevent our ability to commercialize existing, improved, or new products in the EEA. In addition, we or our Notified Bodies (or both) might be unable to timely meet the requirements of MDR. If either of the foregoing were to occur, it could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nAt the same time, European Notified Bodies have begun engaging in more rigorous regulatory enforcement activities and may continue to do so. For example, our Notified Body for the On-X product line temporarily suspended the CE Mark for the On-X ascending aortic prosthesis (\u201cAAP\u201d) in the EEA. See the risk factor below entitled \u201cOur revenues for the On-X AAP in Europe may continue to be adversely affected by regulatory enforcement activities regarding the On-X AAP\u2019s CE Mark\u201d for further discussion. Further, in anticipation of MDR, Notified Bodies will generally no longer review routine submissions unless they are submitted in accordance with MDR. Our inability to timely adapt to these new requirements of our Notified Bodies could adversely impact our clearances and approvals, which could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe may not realize all the anticipated benefits of our agreements with Endospan.\nOn September 11, 2019, we entered into various agreements with Endospan, Ltd. (\u201cEndospan\u201d), an Israeli medical device manufacturer (the \u201cEndospan Transaction\u201d). The Endospan Transaction included an exclusive distribution agreement for NEXUS stent graft system (\u201cNEXUS\u201d) in certain countries in Europe for a fixed distribution fee of $9.0 million; a loan agreement (\u201cEndospan Loan\u201d) for a secured loan from CryoLife to Endospan in an amount up to $15.0 million, funded over three tranches of $5.0 million each upon the completion of certain milestones (the first tranche of which was paid in September 2019); and a security purchase option agreement providing CryoLife the option to purchase all the then outstanding securities of Endospan from Endospan\u2019s existing securityholders for a price between $350.0 million and $450.0 million before or upon FDA approval of NEXUS, for which option CryoLife paid to Endospan $1.0 million.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities, growth prospects, synergies, and other benefits of the Endospan Transaction depends on a number of factors including:\n\uf0b7The continued growth of the global market for stent grafts used in endovascular repair of aortic disease;\n\uf0b7Our ability to introduce and drive adoption of NEXUS in the European market;\n\uf0b7Our ability to foster cross-selling opportunities between JOTEC product portfolio and NEXUS;\n\uf0b7Our ability to leverage our global infrastructure to sell NEXUS, including in the markets in which JOTEC is already direct;\n\uf0b7Our ability to address unforeseen risks, uncertainties and opportunities given our obligations to Endospan;\n\uf0b7Endospan\u2019s ability to comply with the Endospan Loan, as well as other debt obligations, and avoid an event of default;\n\uf0b7Endospan\u2019s ability to successfully commercialize NEXUS in markets outside of Europe;\n\uf0b7Endospan\u2019s ability to meet demand for NEXUS;\n\uf0b7Endospan\u2019s ability to meet quality and regulatory requirements;\n\uf0b7Endospan\u2019s ability to manage any intellectual property risks and uncertainties associated with NEXUS;\n\uf0b7Endospan\u2019s ability to obtain FDA approval of NEXUS; and\n\uf0b7Our ability to manage the unforeseen risks and uncertainties related to NEXUS.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenues, and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially, adversely impact our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all. Any of these factors could negatively impact our earnings per share and negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nSome of our products and technologies are subject to significant intellectual property risks and uncertainty.\nWe own patents, patent applications, and licenses relating to our technologies, which we believe provide us with important competitive advantages. In addition, we have certain proprietary technologies and methods that we believe provide us with important competitive advantages. We cannot be certain that our pending patent applications will issue as patents or that no one will challenge the validity or enforceability of any patent that we own or license. Furthermore, competitors may independently develop similar technologies either before or after our patents expire, or duplicate our technologies, or design around the patented aspects of such technologies.\nOur technologies, products, or services could infringe patents or other rights owned by others, or others could infringe our patents. If we become involved in a patent dispute, the costs of the dispute could be expensive, and if we were to lose or decide to settle the dispute, the amounts or effects of the settlement or award by a tribunal could be costly.\nWe also have obtained licenses from third parties for certain patents and patent application rights. These licenses allow us to use intellectual property rights owned by or licensed to these third parties. We do not control the maintenance, prosecution, enforcement, or strategy for many of these patents or patent application rights and as such are dependent in part on the owners of the intellectual property rights to maintain their viability. Their failure to do so could significantly impair our ability to exploit those technologies.\nOur revenues for the On-X AAP in Europe may continue to be adversely affected by regulatory enforcement activities regarding the On-X AAP\u2019s CE Mark.\nOn November 22, 2016, we received a letter from G-Med, which acts as our Notified Body for the On-X product line, indicating that it was temporarily suspending the CE Mark for the On-X AAP in the EEA, due to an allegedly untimely and allegedly deficient plan by us to address certain technical documentation issues found by G-Med during a review and renewal of the design examination certificate for the On-X AAP. On July 26, 2017, we received a letter from G-Med indicating that it was continuing the suspension of the CE Mark for the AAP product for a period of up to 18 months pending further assessment. We have since withdrawn our application from G-Med for certification of the AAP product and are currently pursuing another pathway to CE Mark for the AAP. Failure to obtain CE Mark for the On-X AAP in the EEA could have a material, adverse effect on EEA revenues for 2020.\nOur investment in PerClot is subject to significant risks, including our ability to fully realize our investment by obtaining FDA approval and to successfully commercialize PerClot in the U.S. either directly or indirectly.\nIn 2010 and 2011, we entered into various agreements with SMI pursuant to which, among other things, we (i) may distribute PerClot in certain international markets and are licensed to manufacture PerClot in the U.S.; (ii) acquired some technology to assist in the production of a potentially key component in PerClot; and (iii) obtained the exclusive right to pursue, obtain, and maintain FDA Pre-Market Approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) for PerClot. We are currently conducting our pivotal clinical trial to gain approval to commercialize PerClot for surgical indications in the U.S., and we completed enrollment in January 2019. We anticipate submission to the FDA during the second half of 2020. There is no guarantee, however, that we will obtain FDA approval when anticipated or at all. The estimated timing of regulatory approval for PerClot is based on factors beyond our control, including but not limited to, unforeseen scheduling difficulties and unfavorable results at various stages in the PMA application process. We may also decide to delay or terminate our pursuit of U.S. regulatory approval for PerClot at any time due to changing conditions at CryoLife, in the marketplace, or in the economy in general.\nFurther, even if we receive FDA PMA for PerClot, we may be unsuccessful in selling PerClot in the U.S. By the time we secure approvals, competitors may have substantial market share or significant market protections due to contracts, among other things. We may also be unsuccessful in selling in countries other than the U.S. due, in part, to a proliferation in other countries of multiple generic competitors, any breach by SMI of its contractual obligations, or the lack of adequate intellectual property protection or enforcement. Any of these occurrences could materially, adversely affect our future revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nReclassification by the FDA of CryoValve\u00ae SG pulmonary heart valve (\u201cCryoValve SGPV\u201d) may make it commercially infeasible to continue processing the CryoValve SGPV.\nIn October 2014 the FDA convened an advisory committee meeting to consider the FDA\u2019s recommendation to re-classify more than minimally manipulated (\u201cMMM\u201d) allograft heart valves from an unclassified medical device to a Class III medical device. The class of allograft heart valves potentially covered by this recommendation includes our CryoValve SGPV. At the meeting, a majority of the advisory committee panel recommended to the FDA that MMM allograft heart valves be re-classified as a Class III product. In December 2019, we learned that the FDA is preparing to issue a proposed rule for reclassification of MMM allograft heart valves as Class III medical devices, which would be subject to a comment period before publication of a final rule. Upon publication of a final rule, should the CryoValve SGPV be determined to be MMM, we expect to have approximately thirty months to submit a PMA application, after which the FDA will determine if, and for how long, we may continue to provide these tissues to customers during review of the PMA application. To date, the FDA has not issued a final rule for reclassification of MMM allograft heart valves.\nWe have continued to process and ship our CryoValve SGPV tissues. If the FDA ultimately classifies our CryoValve SGPV as a Class III medical device, and if there are delays in obtaining the PMA, if we are unsuccessful in obtaining the PMA, or if the costs associated with these activities are significant, this could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and/or cash flows in future periods. In addition, we could decide that the requirements for obtaining a PMA make continued processing of the CryoValve SGPV too onerous, leading us to discontinue distribution of these tissues.\nOur key growth areas may not generate anticipated benefits.\nOur strategic plan is focused on four growth areas, primarily in the cardiac and vascular surgery segment, which are expected to drive our business in the near term. These growth areas and their key elements are described below:\n\uf0b7New Products - Drive growth through product development and commercialization of new and next-generation products and services focused on aortic repair;\n\uf0b7New Indications - Drive growth through new regulatory approvals and expanded indications for our existing products and services to increase the size of our addressable U.S. or international markets;\n\uf0b7Global Expansion - Drive growth by entering new international markets, establishing new international direct sales territories, and developing our commercial infrastructure in new markets, including emerging markets, China and Brazil; and\n\uf0b7Business Development - Drive growth by selectively pursuing acquisitions, licensing, and distribution opportunities that are aligned to our objectives and complement our existing products, services, and infrastructure. Examples include our acquisitions of JOTEC and On-X and our distribution agreement and purchase option for NEXUS. To the extent that we identify, develop, or acquire non-core products or applications, we may dispose of these assets or pursue licensing or distribution agreements with third-party partners for development or commercialization.\nAlthough we continue to implement these strategies, we cannot be certain that they will ultimately drive business expansion and enhance shareholder value.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining necessary clinical results and regulatory approvals for products and services in development, and our new products and services may not achieve market acceptance.\nOur growth and profitability will depend, in part, upon our ability to complete development of, and successfully introduce, new products and services, or expand upon existing indications, which requires that we invest significant time and resources to obtain required regulatory approvals, including significant investment of time and resources into clinical trials. Although we have conducted clinical studies on certain products and services under development, which indicate that such products and services may be effective in a particular application, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully\nexecute on these clinical trials or that the results we obtain from clinical studies will be sufficient for us to obtain any required regulatory approvals or clearances. In addition, we must complete various post-market clinical studies to satisfy various regulatory and reimbursement requirements. These post-market clinical studies also require significant time and resources, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully execute them or that the results we obtain will satisfy post-market regulatory and reimbursement requirements.\nWe are currently engaged in several clinical trials and post-market clinical studies for our products, including our PROACT Xa clinical trial to determine if patients with an On-X mechanical aortic valve can be maintained safely and effectively on apixaban (Eliquis\u00ae) rather than on warfarin, and we also have begun efforts to initiate future U.S. clinical trials for certain JOTEC products. Each of these trials or studies is subject to the risks outlined herein.\nWe cannot give assurance that the relevant regulatory agencies will clear or approve these products and services or indications, or any new products and services or new indications, on a timely basis, if ever, or that the products and services or new indications will adequately meet the requirements of the applicable market or achieve market acceptance. We may encounter delays or rejections during any stage of the regulatory approval process if clinical or other data fails to demonstrate satisfactorily compliance with, or if the service or product fails to meet, the regulatory agency\u2019s requirements for safety, efficacy, and quality, or the regulatory agency otherwise has concerns about our quality or regulatory compliance. Regulatory requirements for safety, efficacy, quality, and the conduct of clinical trials and post-market clinical studies may become more stringent due to changes in applicable laws, regulatory agency policies, or the adoption of new regulations. Clinical trials and post-market clinical studies may also be delayed or halted due to the following, among other factors:\n\uf0b7Unanticipated side effects;\n\uf0b7Lack of funding;\n\uf0b7Inability to locate or recruit clinical investigators;\n\uf0b7Inability to locate, recruit, and qualify sufficient numbers of patients;\n\uf0b7Redesign of clinical trial or post-market clinical study programs;\n\uf0b7Inability to manufacture or acquire sufficient quantities of the products, tissues, or any other components required for clinical trials or post-market clinical study programs;\n\uf0b7Changes in development focus; or\n\uf0b7Disclosure of trial results by competitors.\nOur ability to complete the development of any of our products and services is subject to all of the risks associated with the commercialization of new products and services based on innovative technologies. Such risks include unanticipated technical or other problems, manufacturing, or processing difficulties, and the possibility that we have allocated insufficient funds to complete such development. Consequently, we may not be able to successfully introduce and market our products or services, or we may not be able to do so on a timely basis. These products and services may not meet price or performance objectives and may not prove to be as effective as competing products and services.\nIf we are unable to successfully complete the development of a product, service, or application, or if we determine for financial, technical, competitive, or other reasons not to complete development or obtain regulatory approval or clearance of any product, service, or application, particularly in instances when we have expended significant capital, this could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. Research and development efforts are time consuming and expensive, and we cannot be certain that these efforts will lead to commercially successful products or services. Even the successful commercialization of a new product or service in the medical industry can be characterized by slow growth and high costs associated with marketing, under-utilized production capacity, and continuing research and development and education costs. The introduction of new products or services may require significant physician training and years of clinical evidence derived from follow-up studies on human patients in order to gain acceptance in the medical community.\nAll of these could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks as we seek to expand our business globally.\nThe expansion of our international operations is subject to a number of risks, which may vary significantly from the risks we face in our U.S. operations, including:\n\uf0b7Difficulties and costs associated with staffing, establishing and maintaining internal controls, managing foreign operations, including foreign distributor relationships, and developing direct sales operations in key foreign countries;\n\uf0b7Expanded compliance obligations, including obligations associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Law, local anti-corruption laws, Office of Foreign Asset Control administered sanction programs, and the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation;\n\uf0b7Broader exposure to corruption;\n\uf0b7Overlapping and potentially conflicting international legal and regulatory requirements, as well as unexpected changes in international legal and regulatory requirements or reimbursement policies and programs;\n\uf0b7Longer accounts receivable collection cycles in certain foreign countries and additional cost of collection of those receivables;\n\uf0b7Diminished protection for intellectual property and the presence of a growing number of generic or smaller competitors in some countries;\n\uf0b7Changes in currency exchange rates, particularly fluctuations in the Euro as compared to the U.S. Dollar;\n\uf0b7Differing local product preferences and product requirements;\n\uf0b7Differing local labor and employment laws, including those related to terminations, unionization, and the formation of works councils or other similar employee organizations;\n\uf0b7Adverse economic or political changes or political instability;\n\uf0b7Potential trade restrictions, exchange controls, and import and export licensing requirements including tariffs;\n\uf0b7Potential adverse tax consequences of overlapping tax structures; and\n\uf0b7Potential adverse financial consequences resulting from the exit of the U.K. from the European Union, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d including a potential disruption of sales into the U.K.\nOur failure to adequately address these risks could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe continue to evaluate expansion through acquisitions of, or licenses with, investments in, and distribution arrangements with, other companies or technologies, which may carry significant risks.\nOne of our growth strategies is to selectively pursue the potential acquisition, licensing, or distribution rights of companies or technologies that complement our existing products, services, and infrastructure. In connection with one or more of the acquisition transactions, we may:\n\uf0b7Issue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership interest in us;\n\uf0b7Use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\uf0b7Incur debt, including on terms that could be unfavorable to us or debt that we might be unable to repay;\n\uf0b7Structure the transaction in a manner that has unfavorable tax consequences, such as a stock purchase that does not permit a step-up in the tax basis for the assets acquired;\n\uf0b7Be unable to realize the anticipated benefits, such as increased revenues, cost savings, or synergies from additional sales;\n\uf0b7Be unable to integrate, upgrade, or replace the purchasing, accounting, financial, sales, billing, employee benefits, payroll, and regulatory compliance functions of an acquisition target;\n\uf0b7Be unable to secure or retain the services of key employees related to the acquisition;\n\uf0b7Be unable to succeed in the marketplace with the acquisition; or\n\uf0b7Assume material unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business.\nAs an example of these risks, in December 2017 we acquired JOTEC, which we financed by incurring further debt, using cash on hand, and issuing additional equity securities. This acquisition posed many of the same risks as set forth above.\nAny of the above risks, should they occur, could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows, including the inability to recover our investment or cause a write-down or write-off of such investment, associated goodwill, or assets.\nWe are heavily dependent on our suppliers and contract manufacturers to provide quality materials, supplies, and products.\nThe materials and supplies used in our product manufacturing and our tissue processing are subject to stringent quality standards and requirements, and many of these materials and supplies are subject to significant regulatory oversight and action. If materials or supplies used in our processes fail to meet these standards and requirements or are subject to recall or other quality action, an outcome could be the rejection or recall of our products or tissues and/or the immediate expense of the costs of the manufacturing or preservation. In addition, if these materials and supplies or changes to them do not receive regulatory approval or are recalled, if the related suppliers and/or their facilities are shut down temporarily or permanently, whether by government order, natural disaster, or other reason, or if the related suppliers are otherwise unable or unwilling to supply us, there may not be sufficient materials or supplies available for purchase to allow us to manufacture our products or process tissues. In addition, we rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture some of our products or to provide additional manufacturing capacity for other products. If these contract manufacturers fail to meet our quality standards and requirements or if they are unable or unwilling to supply the products, we may not be able to meet demand for these products. Any of these occurrences or actions could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe are dependent on single and sole-source suppliers and single facilities.\nSome of the materials, supplies, and services that are key components of our product manufacturing or our tissue processing, as well as some of our products, are sourced from single- or sole-source suppliers. As a result, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with those suppliers may be limited, and if those suppliers experience operational, financial, quality, or regulatory difficulties, or if those suppliers and/or their facilities refuse to supply us or cease operations temporarily or permanently, we could be forced to cease product manufacturing or tissue processing until the suppliers resume operations, until alternative suppliers could be identified and qualified, or permanently if the suppliers do not resume operations and no alternative suppliers could be identified and qualified. We could also be forced to purchase alternative materials, supplies, or services with unfavorable terms due to diminished bargaining power.\nAs an example of these risks, we will not have a supply of handpieces for cardiac laser therapy until the FDA approves our supplier\u2019s change in manufacturing location, pending our supplier\u2019s resolution of several observations the FDA raised during a manufacturing site change inspection. We do not believe these observations relate to quality or safety. We currently anticipate resumption of supply during the second half of 2020.\nWe also conduct nearly all our operations at three facilities: Austin, Texas for our On-X product line, Hechingen, Germany for our JOTEC product line, and Kennesaw, Georgia for all our other products. If one of these facilities ceases operations temporarily or permanently, due to natural disaster or other reason, our business could be substantially disrupted.\nRegulatory enforcement activities regarding Etheylene Oxide, which is used to sterilize some of our products and components, could have a material, adverse impact on us.\nSome of our products, including our On-X products in the U.S., are sterilized using ethylene oxide (\u201cEtO\u201d). Although we have a small-scale EtO facility in Austin, Texas, we rely primarily on large-scale EtO facilities to sterilize our products. In addition, some of our suppliers use, or rely upon third parties to use, EtO to sterilize some of our product components. Concerns about the release of EtO into the environment at unsafe levels have led to various regulatory enforcement activities against EtO facilities, including closures and temporary closures. For example, in February 2019, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency issued an order to stop Sterigenics from using EtO at its Willowbrook, Illinois facility; Sterigenics subsequently announced that the facility would not reopen. Also, in October 2019, the Georgia State Attorney General took action to request the potential closure of a Becton Dickinson and Company EtO facility in Covington, Georgia. The number of EtO facilities in the U.S. is limited, and any permanent or temporary closures or disruption to their operations could delay, impede, or prevent our ability to commercialize our products, which could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. In addition, any regulatory enforcement activities against us for our use of EtO could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us.\nThe Coronavirus, and similar outbreaks, could have a material, adverse impact on us.\nAn outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a new coronavirus named \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d (the \u201cCoronavirus\u201d), which was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, has resulted in tens of thousands of infections in China and continues to spread, including to the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the Coronavirus\noutbreak a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern.\u201d If the Coronavirus worsens in China or if the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to contain the Coronavirus continue to restrict the movement of goods and people in China, our business activities in and originating from China, including our activities related to product sales, our supply chain, and regulatory approval for BioGlue in China, could be adversely affected. In addition, if the Coronavirus continues to spread outside of China, our activities worldwide could be adversely affected. If either of the foregoing were to occur, it could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe operate in highly competitive market segments, face competition from large, well-established medical device companies with significant resources, and may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe market for our products and services is intensely competitive and significantly affected by new product introductions and activities of other industry participants. We face intense competition from other companies engaged in the following lines of business:\n\uf0b7The sale of endovascular and surgical stents;\n\uf0b7The sale of mechanical, synthetic, and animal-based tissue valves for implantation;\n\uf0b7The sale of synthetic and animal-based patches for implantation;\n\uf0b7The sale of surgical adhesives, surgical sealants, and hemostatic agents; and\n\uf0b7The processing and preservation of human tissue.\nA significant percentage of market revenues from these products was generated by Baxter International, Inc.; Ethicon (a Johnson & Johnson Company); Medtronic, Inc.; Abbott Laboratories; LivaNova PLC; Edwards Lifesciences Corp.; Bard, a subsidiary of Becton, Dickinson, and Company; Integra Life Sciences Holdings; LifeNet; Admedus, Inc.; Aziyo Biologics; Cook Medical; Gore & Associates; Terumo Corp.; Endologix; Antegraft, Inc.; LeMaitre Vascular, Inc.; Maquet, Inc.; Vascutek; Novadaq Technologies, Inc.; Pfizer, Inc.; and BioCer Entwicklungs-GmbH.\nSeveral of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, including:\n\uf0b7Greater financial and other resources for product research and development, sales and marketing, acquisitions, and patent litigation;\n\uf0b7Enhanced experience in, and resources for, launching, marketing, distributing, and selling products;\n\uf0b7Greater name recognition as well as more recognizable trademarks for products similar to the products that we sell;\n\uf0b7More established record of obtaining and maintaining FDA and other regulatory clearances or approvals for products and product enhancements;\n\uf0b7More established relationships with healthcare providers and payors;\n\uf0b7Lower cost of goods sold or preservation costs;\n\uf0b7Advanced systems for back office automation, product development, and manufacturing, which may provide certain cost advantages; and\n\uf0b7Larger direct sales forces and more established distribution networks.\nOur competitors may develop services, products, or processes with significant advantages over the products, services and processes that we offer or are seeking to develop, and our products and tissues may not be able to compete successfully. If we are unable to successfully market and sell innovative and in-demand products and services, our competitors may gain competitive advantages that may be difficult to overcome. In addition, consolidation among our competitors may make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. If we fail to compete effectively, this could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe are dependent on our key personnel.\nOur business and future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our key personnel, including qualified personnel with medical device and tissue processing experience, and senior management with experience in the medical device or tissue processing space, many of whom would be difficult to replace. Our business and future operating results, including production at our manufacturing and tissue processing facilities, also depend in significant part on our ability to attract and retain qualified management, operations, processing, marketing, sales, and support personnel for our operations. Our main facilities are in Kennesaw, Georgia; Austin, Texas; and Hechingen, Germany, where the local supply of qualified personnel in the medical device and tissue processing industries is limited. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we cannot ensure that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. If we lose any key employees, if any of our key employees fail to perform adequately, or if we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees as needed, this could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nFuture tax reform regulations could have a material, adverse impact on us.\nThe December 2017 tax reform legislation known as H.R. 1, commonly referred to as the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" (\"the Tax Act\"), made significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law. In response, the U.S. Treasury Department issued multiple significant proposed regulation packages to further interpret certain provisions of the Tax Act. As of December 31, 2019, certain significant proposed regulation packages have not yet been finalized. It is possible that when released in final form, these regulation packages could have a material tax impact on us. In addition, we continue to await responses from various state taxing jurisdictions on the impact of the Tax Act on their local taxing regimes. We will continue to monitor and account for the future impacts of federal regulatory and state guidance in the interim period in which such guidance is issued.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control.\nFluctuations in our quarterly and annual financial results have resulted, and will continue to result, from numerous factors, including:\n\uf0b7Changes in demand for the products we sell;\n\uf0b7Increased product and price competition, due to the announcement or introduction of new products by our competitors, market conditions, the regulatory landscape, or other factors;\n\uf0b7Changes in the mix of products we sell;\n\uf0b7Availability of products, materials, and supplies, including donated tissue used in preservation services;\n\uf0b7Our pricing strategy with respect to different product lines;\n\uf0b7Strategic actions by us, such as acquisitions of businesses, products, or technologies;\n\uf0b7Unanticipated costs and expenses;\n\uf0b7Effects of domestic and foreign economic conditions and exchange rates on our industry and/or customers;\n\uf0b7The divestiture or discontinuation of a product line or other revenue generating activity;\n\uf0b7The relocation and integration of manufacturing operations and other strategic restructuring;\n\uf0b7Regulatory actions that may necessitate recalls of our products or warning letters that negatively affect the markets for our products;\n\uf0b7Failure of government and private health plans to adequately and timely reimburse the users of our products or changes in reimbursement policies;\n\uf0b7Costs incurred by us in connection with the termination of contractual and other relationships, including distributorships;\n\uf0b7Our ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable in selected countries outside of the U.S.;\n\uf0b7The expiration or utilization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards;\n\uf0b7Market reception of our new or improved product offerings; and\n\uf0b7The loss of any significant customer, especially in regard to any product that has a limited customer base.\nWe have based our current and future expense levels largely on our investment plans and estimates of future events, although some of our expense levels are, to a large extent, fixed. We may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenue relative to our planned expenditures would have an immediate, adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment, we may from time to time make certain pricing, service, or marketing decisions that could have a material, adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Due to the foregoing factors, some of which are not within our control, the price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially. If our quarterly operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could drop suddenly and significantly. We believe the quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not always meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely upon a combination of sophisticated information technology systems and traditional recordkeeping to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store, and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including, but not limited to, personal information, intellectual property, and, in some instances, patient data). We have also outsourced elements of our operations to third parties, including elements of our information technology systems and, as a result, we manage a number of independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. Our information technology and information security systems and records are potentially vulnerable to security breaches, service interruptions, or data loss from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors. Our information technology and information security systems and records are also potentially vulnerable to malicious attacks by third parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives (including, but not limited to, financial crime, industrial espionage, and market manipulation).\nAs an example of these risks, on November 1, 2019, we were notified that we had become a victim of a business e-mail compromise. During the fourth quarter, a company email account was compromised by a third-party impersonator and a payment intended for one of our U.S. vendors in the amount of $2.6 million was fraudulently re-directed into an individual bank account controlled by this third-party impersonator. The impersonator had taken a number of steps to deceive our employees and reduce the likelihood of detection. We expect our cyber-insurance to cover all but a de minimis amount of the unrecovered losses from this compromise.\nWhile we have invested, and continue to invest, significantly in our information technology and information security systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent further security breaches, service interruptions, or data losses. We have only limited cyber-insurance coverage that does not cover all possible events, and this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. In addition, we may not be able to maintain this insurance. We thus do not have insurance coverage for all possible claims that could be raised and, for those where we do have coverage, those claims could exceed the limits of our coverage. Any security breaches, service interruptions, or data losses could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us or allow third parties to gain material, inside information that they may use to trade in our securities.\nThe implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union in May 2018 could adversely affect our business.\nThe European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) took effect in May 2018. GDPR includes significant new requirements for companies that receive or process the personal data of residents of the European Union (including company employees), which increase our operating costs and require significant management time and energy. GDPR also includes significant penalties for noncompliance. Although our personal data practices, policies, and procedures are intended to comply with GDPR, there can be no assurance that regulatory or enforcement authorities will view these arrangements as being in compliance with applicable laws, or that one or more of our employees or agents will not disregard the rules we have established. Any GDPR related government enforcement activities may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, and subject us to significant penalties, any of which could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nMany healthcare industry companies, including health care systems, are consolidating to create new companies with greater market power. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. These industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions. If we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the healthcare industry, our revenues would decrease and our financial condition, profitability, and/or cash flows would suffer.\nThe success of some of our products and preservation services depends upon relationships with healthcare professionals.\nIf we fail to maintain our working relationships with healthcare professionals, many of our products and preservation services may not be developed and marketed to appropriately meet the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products and preservation services or the patients who receive them.\nThe research, development, marketing, and sales of many of our new and improved products and preservation services are dependent upon us maintaining working relationships with healthcare professionals. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding our products and preservation services. Healthcare professionals assist us as researchers, marketing and training consultants, product consultants, and speakers. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with these professionals and do not continue to receive their advice and input, the development and commercialization of our products and preservation services could suffer, which could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions if we are deemed to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved, or off-label, uses.\nOur business and future growth depend on the continued use of our products for specific approved uses. Generally, unless the products are approved or cleared by the FDA for the alternative uses, the FDA contends that we may not make claims about the safety or effectiveness of our products, or promote them, for such uses. Such limitations present a risk that the FDA or other federal or state law enforcement authorities could determine that the nature and scope of our sales, marketing, and/or support activities, though designed to comply with all FDA requirements, constitute the promotion of our products for an unapproved use in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. We also face the risk that the FDA or other governmental authorities might pursue enforcement based on past activities that we have discontinued or changed, including sales activities, arrangements with institutions and doctors, educational and training programs, and other activities. Investigations concerning the promotion of unapproved uses and related issues are typically expensive, disruptive, and burdensome and generate negative publicity. If our promotional activities are found to be in violation of the law, we may face significant fines and penalties and may be required to substantially change our sales, promotion, grant, and educational activities. There is also a possibility that we could be enjoined from selling some or all of our products for any unapproved use. In addition, as a result of an enforcement action against us or our executive officers, we could be excluded from participation in government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nOur acquired federal tax net operating loss and general business credit carryforwards will be limited or may expire, which could result in greater future income tax expense and adversely impact future cash flows.\nOur federal tax net operating loss and general business credit carryforwards include acquired net operating loss carryforwards. Such acquired net operating loss carryforwards will be limited in future periods due to a change in control of our former subsidiaries Hemosphere and Cardiogenesis, as mandated by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d). We believe that our acquisitions of these companies each constituted a change in control, and that prior to our acquisition, Hemosphere had experienced other equity ownership changes that should be considered a change in control. We also acquired net operating loss carryforwards in certain foreign jurisdictions with the JOTEC Acquisition, but we do not believe these carryforwards will be limited in any material way due to a change of control provision. The deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets exclude amounts that we expect will not be realizable due to these changes in control. A portion of the acquired net operating loss carryforwards is related to state income taxes for which we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized. Therefore, we recorded a valuation allowance against these state net operating loss carryforwards. Limitations on our federal tax net operating loss and general business credit carryforwards could result in greater future income tax expense and adversely impact future cash flows.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and international bribery, anti-kickback, false claims, privacy, transparency, and similar laws, any breach of which could cause a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and profitability.\nOur relationships with physicians, hospitals, and other healthcare providers are subject to scrutiny under various U.S. and international bribery, anti-kickback, false claims, privacy, transparency, and similar laws, often referred to collectively as \u201chealthcare compliance laws.\u201d Healthcare compliance laws are broad, sometimes ambiguous, complex, and subject to changing interpretations. Possible sanctions for violation of these healthcare compliance laws include monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from government healthcare programs, and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions. Any government investigation or a finding of a violation of these laws, despite our compliance efforts, could result in a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and profitability.\nWe have entered into consulting agreements, speaker agreements, research agreements, and product development agreements with healthcare professionals or healthcare organizations, including some who may order our products or make decisions to use them. While these transactions were structured with the intention of complying with all applicable compliance laws, it is possible that regulatory or enforcement agencies or courts may in the future view these transactions as prohibited arrangements that must be restructured or for which we would be subject to other significant civil or criminal penalties.\nWe have also adopted the AdvaMed Code of Conduct and the MedTech Europe Code of Ethical Business Practice into our Code of Business Conduct, which governs our relationships with healthcare professionals, including our payment of travel and lodging expenses, research and educational grant procedures, and sponsorship of third-party conferences. In addition, we conduct training sessions on these principles. There can be no assurance, however, that regulatory or enforcement authorities will view these arrangements as being in compliance with applicable laws or that one or more of our employees or agents will not disregard the rules we have established. Because our strategy relies on the involvement of healthcare professionals or healthcare organizations who consult with us on the design of our products, perform clinical research on our behalf, or educate the market about the efficacy and uses of our products, we could be materially impacted if regulatory or enforcement agencies or courts interpret our financial relationships with healthcare professionals or healthcare organizations, who refer or order our products, to be in violation of applicable laws and determine that we would be unable to achieve compliance with such applicable laws. This could harm our reputation and the reputations of the healthcare professionals or healthcare organizations we engage to provide services on our behalf. In addition, the cost of noncompliance with these laws could be substantial since we could be subject to monetary fines and civil or criminal penalties, and we could also be excluded from government funded healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, for noncompliance.\nThe scope and enforcement of all of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change, especially in light of the scarcity of applicable precedent and regulations. There can be no assurance that regulatory or enforcement authorities will not investigate or challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any investigation or challenge could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and profitability. Any regulatory or enforcement review of us, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time consuming. Additionally, we cannot predict the impact of any changes in or interpretations of these laws, whether these changes will be retroactive or will have effect on a going-forward basis only.\nHealthcare policy changes may have a material, adverse effect on us.\nIn response to perceived increases in healthcare costs in recent years, there have been, and continue to be, proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators, and third-party payors to control these costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. Some of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products. The adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition and profitability. Candidates for the 2020 presidential election have put forward numerous healthcare reform proposals, including \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d These proposals may affect aspects of our business. We cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they will be adopted, or what impact they may have on us. Any changes that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes, however, could adversely affect our business and profitability.\nContinued fluctuation of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar could materially, adversely affect our business.\nThe majority of our foreign product revenues are denominated in Euros and, as such, are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. In addition, a portion of our dollar-denominated product sales are made to customers in other countries who must convert local currencies into U.S. Dollars in order to purchase these products. We also have balances, such as cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accruals that are denominated in foreign currencies. These foreign currency transactions and balances are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. Fluctuations in exchange rates of Euros or other local currencies in relation to the U.S. Dollar could materially reduce our future revenues as compared to the comparable prior periods. Should this occur, it could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nOur existing insurance coverage may be insufficient, and we may be unable to obtain insurance in the future.\nOur products and tissues allegedly have caused, and may in the future cause, injury to patients using our products or tissues, and we have been, and may be, exposed to product and tissue processing liability claims. We maintain claims-made insurance policies to mitigate our financial exposure to product and tissue processing liability claims. Claims-made insurance policies generally cover only those asserted claims and incidents that are reported to the insurance carrier while the policy is in effect. In addition, our product and tissue processing liability insurance policies do not include coverage for any punitive damages. Although we have insurance for product and tissue processing liabilities, securities, property, and general liabilities, it is possible that:\n\uf0b7We could be exposed to product and tissue processing liability claims and security claims greater than the amount that we have insured;\n\uf0b7We may be unable to obtain future insurance policies in an amount sufficient to cover our anticipated claims at a reasonable cost or at all; or\n\uf0b7Because we are not insured against all potential losses, uninsured losses due to natural disasters or other catastrophes could adversely impact our business.\nAny product liability claim, with or without merit, could result in an increase in our product insurance rates or our inability to secure coverage on reasonable terms, if at all. Even in the absence of a claim, our insurance rates may rise in the future due to market, industry, or other factors. Any product liability claim, even a meritless or unsuccessful one, would be time-consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our business and result in adverse publicity, withdrawal of clinical trial participants, injury to our reputation, and loss of revenue.\nIf we are unsuccessful in arranging acceptable settlements of future product or tissue processing liability claims or future securities class action or derivative claims, we may not have sufficient insurance coverage and liquid assets to meet these obligations. If we are unable to obtain satisfactory insurance coverage in the future, we may be subject to additional future exposure from product or tissue processing liability or securities claims. Additionally, if one or more claims with respect to which we may become, in the future, a defendant should result in a substantial verdict rendered in favor of the plaintiff(s), such verdict(s) could exceed our available insurance coverage and liquid assets. If we are unable to meet required future cash payments to resolve any outstanding or any future claims, this will materially, adversely affect our financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. Further, although we have an estimated reserve for our unreported product and tissue processing liability claims for which we do expect that we will obtain recovery under our insurance policies, these costs could exceed our current estimates. Finally, our facilities could be materially damaged by tornadoes, flooding, other natural disasters, or catastrophic circumstances, for which we are not fully covered by business interruption and disaster insurance, and, even with such coverage, we could suffer substantial losses in our inventory and operational capacity, along with a potential adverse impact on our customers and opportunity costs for which our insurance would not compensate us.\nAny of these events could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nOur business could be negatively impacted as a result of shareholder activism.\nIn recent years, shareholder activists have become involved in numerous public companies. Shareholder activists frequently propose to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction, and operations of a company. We may in the future become subject to such shareholder activism and demands. Such demands may disrupt our business and divert the attention of our management and employees, and any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, all of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, actions of activist shareholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nIn December 2015 our Board of Directors discontinued dividend payments on our common stock for the foreseeable future. If we do not pay cash dividends, our shareholders may receive a return on their investment in our common stock only if the market price of our common stock has increased when they sell shares of our common stock that they own. Future dividends, if any, will be authorized by our Board of Directors and declared by us based upon a variety of factors deemed relevant by our directors, including, among other things, our financial condition, liquidity, earnings projections, and business prospects. In addition, restrictions in our credit facility limit our ability to pay future dividends. We can provide no assurance of our ability to pay cash dividends in the future.\nProvisions of Florida law and anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to shareholders, which could affect our share price adversely and prevent attempts by shareholders to remove current management.\nWe are subject to the Florida affiliated transactions statute, which generally requires approval by the disinterested directors or supermajority approval by shareholders for \u201caffiliated transactions\u201d between a corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d Additionally, our organizational documents contain provisions restricting persons who may call shareholder meetings and allowing the Board of Directors to fill vacancies and fix the number of directors. These provisions of Florida law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could prevent attempts by shareholders to remove current management, prohibit or delay mergers or other changes of control transactions, and discourage attempts by other companies to acquire us, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 78876, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "CRY"}
