{"cik": "1579684", "company": "Gannett Co., Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating us and our Common Stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial condition, our ability to make distributions on our Common Stock and the market price of our Common Stock. Although the risk factors are grouped by general category, many of the risks described in a given category relate to multiple categories.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following is a summary of some of the risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, which are discussed in more detail below:\n\u2022Our substantial indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business or financial condition.\n\u2022Our inability to raise funds necessary to settle conversions of, or to repurchase, the Company's 6.0% Senior Secured Convertible Notes due 2027 (the \"2027 Notes\"), upon a fundamental change as described in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes, may lead to defaults under such indenture and under agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness.\n\u2022Our business currently relies on sources of revenues that have been, and likely will continue to be, negatively affected by digital commerce and media. In addition, our strategy of growing our paid digital-only subscriber base is expected to negatively impact advertising revenues in the near term.\n\u2022We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to execute our digital revenue strategy and optimize our revenue streams.\n\u2022Our ReachLocal business purchases most of its media from Google, and its business could be adversely affected if Google takes actions that are adverse to our interests. Similar actions from Yahoo!, Microsoft, Facebook and other media providers could also adversely affect these businesses.\n\u2022We may not achieve all the intended benefits of the acquisition of Legacy Gannett.\n\u2022Our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage the expanded scope of our operations as a result of our acquisition of Legacy Gannett.\n\u2022The diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention to the integration of Legacy Gannett could adversely affect our day-to-day business.\n\u2022Our ability to generate revenues is highly sensitive to the strength of the economies in which we operate and the demographics of the local communities that we serve.\n\u2022We expect the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material negative impact on our business and results of operations in the near term, and possibly longer.\n\u2022Uncertainty and adverse changes in the general economic conditions of markets in which we participate, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic, may continue to negatively affect our business.\n\u2022The collectability of accounts receivable under adverse economic conditions could deteriorate to a greater extent than provided for in our financial statements and in our projections of future results.\n\u2022Our financial results are subject to risks associated with our international operations.\n\u2022Foreign exchange variability could materially and adversely affect our consolidated operating results.\n\u2022The U.K.'s exit from the European Union could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\u2022Domestic and/or foreign jurisdictions may enact gross receipts taxes on our digital services which, if we are required to pay, could adversely affect our cash flows and financial condition.\n\u2022Our business is subject to seasonal and other fluctuations, which affects our revenues and operating results.\n\u2022The value of our intangible assets may become impaired, which could adversely affect future reported results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity.\n\u2022Our management and independent auditors have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which could, if not remediated in an appropriate and timely way, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\n\u2022We may not be able to protect intellectual property rights upon which our business relies and, if we lose intellectual property protection, our assets may lose value.\n\u2022We are subject to environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations that could cause us to incur significant compliance expenditures and liabilities.\n\u2022Our possession and use of personal information and the use of payment cards by our customers present risks and expenses that could harm our business. Unauthorized access to or disclosure or manipulation of such data, whether through breach of our network security or otherwise, could expose us to liabilities and costly litigation and damage our reputation.\n\u2022Privacy-related laws are constantly evolving and may increase our compliance costs and potential for liability, either of which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We could incur significant liability if the separation of Legacy Gannett from its former parent were determined to be a taxable transaction.\n\u2022The Internal Revenue Service may disallow all or part of a worthless stock loss and bad debt deduction.\n\u2022We may not be able to generate future taxable income which may prevent our realization of deferred tax assets.\n\u2022We are required to use a portion of our cash flows to make contributions to our pension plans, which diverts cash flow from operations, and the amount of required future contributions may be difficult to estimate.\n\u2022We depend on key personnel, and we may not be able to operate or grow our business effectively if we lose the services of any of our key personnel or are unable to attract qualified personnel in the future.\n\u2022A shortage of skilled or experienced employees, including journalists, in the media industry, or our inability to retain such employees, could pose a risk to achieving improved productivity and reducing costs, which could adversely affect our profitability.\n\u2022A number of our employees are unionized, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if current or additional labor negotiations or contracts were to further restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations.\n\u2022Sustained increases in costs of employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability.\n\u2022Our inability to successfully transition to self-management following termination of the Amended Management Agreement may result in the loss of key employees, disruptions to our business and operational inefficiencies that could hinder our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022The Manager is not liable to us for certain acts or omissions performed in accordance with, and prior to the termination of, the Amended Management Agreement, and for certain matters in connection with the termination of our relationship with the Manager, and we may incur liability for such acts or omissions.\n\u2022There can be no assurance that the market for our stock will provide adequate liquidity.\n\u2022Our Common Stock may be delisted from the NYSE if we fail to comply with continued listing standards.\n\u2022Sales or issuances of shares of our Common Stock, including upon conversion of the 2027 Notes, could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\n\u2022We presently have no intention to declare or pay a dividend and we may not be able to pay dividends in the future or at all.\n\u2022The percentage ownership of our existing stockholders may be diluted in the future, including upon conversion of the 2027 Notes.\n\u2022An \"ownership change\" could limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes, which could result in our payment of income taxes earlier than if we were able to fully utilize our net operating loss and other tax benefit carryforwards.\n\u2022We have entered into a Section 382 Rights Agreement, and if the share purchase rights issued pursuant to such agreement are exercised, it could materially and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\n\u2022Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and of Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could decrease the trading price of our Common Stock.\n\u2022Future offerings of debt securities, which would rank senior to our Common Stock upon our liquidation, and future offerings of equity securities, may be senior to our Common Stock for the purposes of dividend and liquidating distributions, may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business or financial condition.\nOn February 9, 2021, the Company entered into a five-year, senior-secured term loan facility with Citibank, N.A. in an aggregate principal amount of $1.045 billion (the \"5-Year Term Loan\"). The 5-Year Term Loan matures on February 9, 2026 and, at the Company's option, bears interest of the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin equal to 7.00% per annum or an alternate base rate plus a margin equal to 6.00% per annum. Accordingly, we are required to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to fund interest payments. The 5-Year Term Loan amortizes at a rate equal to 10% per annum (or, if the ratio of Total Indebtedness secured on an equal priority basis with the 5-Year Term Loan (net of Unrestricted Cash) to Consolidated EBITDA (as such terms are defined in the 5-Year Term Loan) is equal to or less than a specified ratio, 5% per annum) payable in equal quarterly installments. In addition, we are required to repay our credit facility from time to time with (i) the proceeds of non-ordinary course asset sales and casualty and condemnation events and (ii) the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand at the Company and its restricted subsidiaries in excess of $100 million as of the last day of any fiscal year of the Company (beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021). Our debt service obligations reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, investments and potential distributions to\nstockholders. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations. Our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operations, which is subject to a variety of risks, including general economic conditions and the strength of our competitors, which are outside our control.\nThe terms of our indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. The 5-Year Term Loan and the 2027 Notes require us to comply with numerous affirmative and negative covenants, including a requirement to maintain minimum liquidity of $30 million, and restrictions limiting our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make investments and acquisitions, pay certain dividends, sell assets, merge, incur certain liens, enter into agreements with our affiliates, change our business, engage in sale/leaseback transactions, and modify our organizational documents. With respect to dividends, under the 5-Year Term Loan, we can only pay cash dividends up to an agreed-upon amount, provided the ratio of Total Indebtedness secured on an equal priority basis with the 5-Year Term Loan (net of Unrestricted Cash) to Consolidated EBITDA (as such terms are defined in the 5-Year Term Loan) does not exceed a specified ratio. The indenture for the 2027 Notes (the \"Indenture\") contains a similar dividend restriction and also provides that, at any time that the Company\u2019s Total Gross Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Indenture) exceeds 1.5 and the Company approves the declaration of a dividend, the Company must offer to purchase a principal amount of 2027 Notes equal to the proposed amount of the dividend. This repurchase offer requirement may make it impractical to declare and pay dividends at any time that the requirement is in effect. Stockholders also should be aware that they have no contractual or other legal right to dividends that have not been declared.\nA failure to satisfy our debt service obligations on the remaining 5-Year Term Loan, a breach of a covenant in our credit facility, or a material breach of a representation or warranty in our credit facility, among other events specified in the credit facility, could give rise to a default, which could give rise to the right of our lenders to declare our indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. A failure to satisfy our debt service or conversion obligations on the 2027 Notes, among other events specified in the Indenture, could also give rise to a default, which could give rise to the right of noteholders to declare the principal of the 2027 Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. An acceleration of our indebtedness would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nOur inability to raise funds necessary to settle conversions of, or to repurchase, the 2027 Notes, upon a fundamental change as described in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes, may lead to defaults under such indenture and under agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness.\nIf we settle the 2027 Notes by cash, or by a combination of cash and shares of our Common Stock, upon a fundamental change as described in the Indenture, we will be required to make cash payments with respect to the 2027 Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make purchases of the 2027 Notes being surrendered or converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the 2027 Notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2027 Notes is limited by the agreements governing our existing indebtedness (including the 5-Year Term Loan) and may also be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements that will govern our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase 2027 Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the Indenture or to pay cash payable on future conversions of the 2027 Notes as required by the Indenture would constitute a default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness (including the 5-Year Term Loan).\nRisks Related to Digital Commerce and Media\nOur business currently relies on sources of revenues that have been, and likely will continue to be, negatively affected by digital commerce and media. In addition, our strategy of growing our paid digital-only subscriber base is expected to negatively impact advertising revenues in the near term.\nIn recent years, we have experienced declining revenue (on a same-store basis). The majority of our revenues are from (i) advertising and marketing services and (ii) paid circulation (in each case, both in print and digital mediums). Print advertising alone accounted for approximately 26% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nTo date, our revenue declines have been driven primarily by a pronounced decline across all categories of print advertising revenue (national, local and classified) related to the rise of digital media and commerce. The increased popularity of digital media and commerce has shifted demand from print advertising to digital advertising, and large digital platforms, such as Facebook, Google and Amazon, which have extensive audience reach, data and targeting capabilities, command a large share of the digital advertising market. Further, media companies generally charge much lower rates for digital advertising than for print\nadvertising due to the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space, and mobile advertising rates typically are even lower than desktop digital rates. Additionally, brick-and-mortar businesses are significant consumers of print advertising and with the rise of digital commerce many of these types of businesses have, and continue to, close retail outlets, which adversely affects the demand for print advertising.\nCirculation revenue has been affected to a lesser extent, but more marked future declines in circulation revenue are possible. Revenue from paid circulation is a function of the volume of subscribers and the price of subscriptions. In recent years, we have experienced significant declines in the number of subscribers to our newspapers, as a result of competition from digital media and the demographic shift of traditional print newspaper readers getting older while younger generations tend to consume media through digital platforms. We have also focused on growing the volume of digital subscribers, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to grow, or even retain, our current digital subscriber volume, especially at rates similar to the rates we are able to charge for our print products.\nA key element of our consumer strategy is growing our paid digital-only subscriber base which initially is expected to lead to declines in our existing advertising revenue. To implement our strategy and grow our paid digital-only subscriber base, we may need to restrict certain content from non-subscriber access or limit the amount of content non-subscribers can view in an effort to encourage non-subscribers to become paid digital subscribers. In the short-term, this strategy is expected to reduce the number of unique visitors accessing our content and, in turn, reduce our digital advertising revenue. Over time, the anticipated increase in the number of paid digital-only subscribers is expected to increase our circulation revenue derived from paid digital-only subscribers as well as our digital advertising revenues. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase the number of our digital-only subscribers and, if we are unable to grow or retain the volume of such subscribers, our circulation and advertising revenues could decline adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition.\nDeclining subscriber volume can also lead to more marked declines in advertising revenue. Print subscriber volume declines directly impact preprint and other print revenues that are linked to number of subscribers. In terms of digital advertising revenues, news aggregation websites and customized news feeds (often free to users) reduce traffic on our websites and related digital advertising revenues. These types of websites also compete with us in selling digital-only subscriptions to our websites, which reduces our ability to monetize our content digitally. If traffic levels stagnate or decline, and/or print subscriber volume continues to decline, we may not be able to maintain or increase the advertising rates or attract new advertising customers. Further, we are generally not compensated for the consumption of our original content on third-party digital products and social platforms.\nWe also generate revenues from a commercial printing and distribution business that manages printing and distribution of publications for third parties, which generated approximately 5% of our total revenues in 2020. Our commercial and/or printing businesses could also be adversely affected by the same secular trends that are affecting our core advertising and circulation revenues. These third parties are experiencing the same print volume declines our business experiences and, as such, our commercial printing and distribution revenues could experience declines in the future. In addition, our relationships with these third parties are generally pursuant to short-term contracts, and a decision by any of the three largest national publications or the major local publications to cease publishing in those markets or seek alternatives to their current business practice of partnering with us could have an additional adverse effect on our revenue trends. For all of the foregoing reasons, we may experience persistent declines in revenue, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, our ability to make distributions on our Common Stock and the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe may be unsuccessful in our efforts to execute our digital revenue strategy and optimize our revenue streams.\nPrint-related revenue streams have continued to decline at a significant pace. We have focused on offsetting traditional print advertising and circulation revenue declines in part by diversifying our sources of revenue through the development and acquisition of complementary businesses with growth potential. For example, our business USA TODAY NETWORK Ventures produces local events. In addition, with the acquisition of Legacy Gannett, we expanded our digital marketing solutions businesses to include ReachLocal and WordStream.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to grow revenue from these or other complementary businesses we may develop internally or acquire, or that any revenue generated by new business lines will be adequate to offset revenue declines from our legacy businesses. For example, technological developments could adversely affect the availability, applicability, marketability and profitability of the suite of SMB services we offer. Technological developments and any changes we make to our business strategy may require significant capital investments, and such investments may be restricted by the 5-Year Term Loan.\nThese complementary businesses also face competition from various digital media providers, such as Google and Yahoo!, which may have more resources to invest in product development and marketing. Our salesforce may not be able to utilize the relationships we have throughout our local property network to effectively sell these products. If we are unable to diversify our traditional revenues with revenues from complementary businesses, we may experience persistent declines in revenue which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ReachLocal business purchases most of its media from Google, and its business could be adversely affected if Google takes actions that are adverse to our interests. Similar actions from Yahoo!, Microsoft, Facebook and other media providers could also adversely affect these businesses.\nMost of ReachLocal and WordStream's cost of sales relates to the purchase of media, and a substantial majority of the media it purchases is from Google. Google accounts for a large majority of all U.S. searches, and Google's share in certain foreign markets is often even greater. As a result, we expect our ReachLocal and WordStream businesses will depend upon media purchases from Google for the foreseeable future. This dependence makes that business vulnerable to actions Google may take to change the manner in which it sells AdWords or otherwise conducts its business. In addition, any new developments or rumors of developments regarding Google's business practices that affect the local online advertising industry may adversely affect our products or create perceptions with clients that our ability to compete in the online marketing industry has been impaired. These risks also apply to other publishers with whom we do business, including Yahoo!, Facebook and Microsoft.\nRisks Related to Our Acquisition and Integration of Legacy Gannett\nWe may not achieve all the intended benefits of the acquisition of Legacy Gannett.\nWe completed the acquisition of Legacy Gannett in November 2019 and have already begun experiencing many of the benefits from the acquisition. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize every intended benefit of the transaction. There are many challenges associated with integrating a material acquisition, such as our acquisition of Legacy Gannett, including the integration of executive and other employee teams with historically different cultures and priorities; the coordination of personnel located across multiple geographic locations; retaining key management and other employees; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; the diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns; retaining existing business and operational relationships, including customers, suppliers and other counterparties, and attracting new business and operational relationships; unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; as well as unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisition. Although we have already realized a number of anticipated synergies and benefits from the acquisition of Legacy Gannett, we may not achieve every expected benefit in the expected timeframe or at all.\nIf we fail to realize anticipated synergies in the amount and within the timeframe expected, our actual financial condition and results of operations may differ materially from the illustrative financial information disclosed in connection with the acquisition, which was based on various assumptions and estimates that may prove to be incorrect. Such illustrative financial information did not constitute management\u2019s projections of future financial performance or results of operations; however, any material variance from such illustrative financial information could result in negative investor reactions that materially and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. Our actual financial condition and results of operations may differ materially even if synergies are realized, due to macroeconomic and other external factors or a variety of other risks to our business that are independent of the acquisition.\nOur future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage the expanded scope of our operations as a result of our acquisition of Legacy Gannett.\nWith completion of the Legacy Gannett acquisition, the size and geographical scope of our business has increased significantly. Our continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage these expanded business operations, including across the U.S. and the United Kingdom, which poses substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. As part of managing the expanded business, we are in the process of implementing a strategic initiative expected to achieve cost-savings and efficiencies. The initiative includes outsourcing certain of our administrative operations to outside the U.S. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in managing the scope of our expanded operations or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, and other benefits from the combined business that we currently anticipate.\nThe diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention to the integration of Legacy Gannett could adversely affect our day-to-day business.\nThe integration of Legacy Gannett places a significant burden on our management and internal resources. The diversion of management\u2019s attention away from day-to-day business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could adversely affect our financial results.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Factors\nOur ability to generate revenues is highly sensitive to the strength of the economies in which we operate and the demographics of the local communities that we serve.\nOur advertising revenues and, to a lesser extent, circulation revenues, depend upon a variety of factors specific to the communities that our publications serve. These factors include, among others, the size and demographic characteristics of the local population, local economic conditions in general and the economic condition of the retail segments of the communities that our publications serve. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including mandatory business closures, have generally worsened the economic condition of many retail segments. If the local economy, population or prevailing retail environment of a community we serve experiences a downturn, our publications, revenues and profitability in that market could be adversely affected. Our advertising revenues are also susceptible to negative trends in the general economy that affect customer spending. The advertisers in our newspapers and other publications and related websites are primarily retail businesses that can be significantly affected by regional or national economic downturns and other developments. For example, many traditional retail companies continue to face greater competition from online retailers and face uncertainty in their businesses, which has reduced and may continue to reduce their advertising spending. Declines in the U.S. economy could also significantly affect key advertising revenue categories, including classified ads such as help wanted, real estate, and automotive. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have generally exacerbated these circumstances.\nWe expect the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material negative impact on our business and results of operations in the near term, and possibly longer.\nWhile we are generally exempt from governmental mandates requiring closures of non-essential businesses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken to mitigate the pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business. Our ability to generate revenues is highly sensitive to the strength of the economies in which we operate, and actions taken to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, including widespread business closures and social distancing measures, could lead to an economic recession. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced revenue and profitability declines in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Since March 2020, we have experienced decreasing demand for our advertising and digital marketing services as well as reductions in the single copy and commercial distribution of our newspapers. Declining revenue may impair our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to service the 5-Year Term Loan and the 2027 Notes. Accordingly, the COVID-19 pandemic has had the effect of heightening various risks described in this Form 10-K.\nWhile we have implemented, and continue to implement, measures intended to reduce costs and preserve cash flow in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (including, but not limited to, employee furloughs, decreases in employee compensation and reductions in discretionary spending), there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset the negative impacts of the pandemic and that we will have sufficient cash flow to satisfy our commitments. In addition, measures taken to preserve cash flow and defer payments into future periods, such as the deferral of pension obligations, may have a greater impact on cash flow in future periods as we also incur such payments in the normal course of business. Moreover, such measures, and further measures we may implement in the future in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively impact our reputation and our ability to attract and retain employees. See \"Risks Related to Pension Obligations and Employees\" below.\nIn the long-term, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operations will depend on the severity and length of the pandemic, the duration, effectiveness, and extent of the mitigation measures and governmental actions designed to combat the pandemic, including the development and availability of effective treatments or vaccines, as well as changes in customer behavior as a result of the pandemic, all of which are highly uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures could continue to, depending upon the duration of the pandemic, have a material negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nUncertainty and adverse changes in the general economic conditions of markets in which we participate, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic, may continue to negatively affect our business.\nCurrent and future conditions in the economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty, which has been magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction for the economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors and regions of the economy, including the markets in which we participate. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic and related measures to contain its spread have created significant volatility and economic uncertainty, which is expected to continue in the near term. In addition, advertisers may respond to such uncertainty by reducing their budgets or shifting priorities or spending patterns, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nAdverse changes may also occur as a result of weak global economic conditions, declining oil prices, wavering customer confidence, increasing unemployment, volatility in stock markets, contraction of credit availability, declines in real estate values, natural disasters, or other factors affecting economic conditions in general. These changes may negatively affect the sales of our products, increase exposure to losses from bad debts, increase the cost and decrease the availability of financing, or increase costs associated with publishing and distributing our publications.\nThe collectability of accounts receivable under adverse economic conditions could deteriorate to a greater extent than provided for in our financial statements and in our projections of future results.\nAdverse economic conditions in the U.S. may increase our exposure to losses resulting from financial distress, insolvency and the potential bankruptcy of our advertising customers. We have recorded write-offs of accounts receivable relating to recent bankruptcies of national retailers. Our accounts receivable is stated at net estimated realizable value, and our allowance for doubtful accounts has been determined based on several factors, including receivable agings, significant individual credit risk accounts and historical experience. If such collectability estimates prove inaccurate, adjustments to future operating results could occur.\nRisks Related to International Operations\nOur financial results are subject to risks associated with our international operations.\nNewsquest operates in the U.K., and ReachLocal has international sales operations in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, as well as campaign support services in India. Revenue from Newsquest accounted for 6% of our Publishing segment's total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenue from international operations outside North America accounted for 5% of our Digital Marketing Solutions segment's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our ability to manage these international operations successfully is subject to numerous risks inherent in foreign operations, including:\n\u2022Challenges or uncertainties arising from unexpected legal, political, or systemic events, including the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022Difficulties or delays in developing a network of clients in international markets;\n\u2022Restrictions on the ability of U.S. companies to do business in certain foreign countries;\n\u2022Compliance with legal or regulatory requirements, including with respect to internet services, privacy and data protection, censorship, banking and money transfers, and sale transactions, which may limit or prevent the offering of our products in some jurisdictions or otherwise harm our business;\n\u2022International intellectual property laws that may be insufficient to protect our intellectual property or permit us to successfully defend our intellectual property in international lawsuits;\n\u2022Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, as well as the existence of workers' councils and labor unions, which could make it more difficult to terminate underperforming employees;\n\u2022Currency fluctuations and price controls or other restrictions on foreign currency; and\n\u2022Potential adverse tax consequences, including difficulties in repatriating earnings generated abroad.\nAny of the foregoing factors could adversely impact our international operations, which could harm our overall business, operating results, and financial condition.\nForeign exchange variability could materially and adversely affect our consolidated operating results.\nOur financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars. Newsquest operates in the U.K., and its operations are conducted in foreign currency, primarily the British pound sterling. Weakening in the British pound sterling to U.S. dollar exchange rate has in the past, and could in the future, diminish Newsquest's contributions to our results of operations. In addition, ReachLocal conducts operations in several foreign jurisdictions. If the value of currency in any of those jurisdictions weakens as compared with the U.S. dollar, ReachLocal\u2019s operations in those jurisdictions similarly will contribute less to our results.\nThe U.K.'s exit from the European Union could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe U.K. left the European Union on January 31, 2020 (\"Brexit\") and on January 1, 2021, left the European Union single market and customs union. On December 24, 2020, the U.K. and European Union entered into the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (\"TCA\"). The TCA went into effect on January 1, 2021 and is being applied provisionally from that date until it is fully ratified or rejected by the European Parliament, or until February 28, 2021. The TCA provides, among other things, for a duty- and quota-free trade agreement between the U.K. and the European Union with respect to goods originating in the free trade area, however, custom formalities went into effect upon the U.K.\u2019s exit from the single market and customs union. The TCA does not address a number of important aspects of the new relationship between the U.K. and the European Union, including providing for the free movement of services, which ended on December 31, 2020. As a result, uncertainty remains regarding the future relationship between the U.K. and the European Union, which could result in a decline in trade among them and other countries. Such a decline in trade could affect the attractiveness of the U.K. as a global investment center and, as a result, could have a detrimental impact on economic growth in the country. Furthermore, there are likely to be changes in the legal rights and obligations of commercial parties across all industries following Brexit, and British regulatory requirements could be subject to significant change. Any of the foregoing could result in an economic downturn in Newsquest\u2019s markets, which could depress the demand for our products and services.\nDomestic and/or foreign jurisdictions may enact gross receipts taxes on our digital services which, if we are required to pay, could adversely affect our cash flows and financial condition.\nOn July 22, 2020, a Digital Services Tax (\"DST\") was enacted in the United Kingdom. This 2% tax became effective April 1, 2020. The DST applies to gross revenue of specified digital business models deriving value from participation of their U.K.-based users. While the tax is intended to apply to search engines, social media platforms, and online marketplaces, it may be applied to online advertising when users of our publications receive advertising based on their participation with the publications. If that is the case, we may have to pay additional cash taxes, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOn February 12, 2021, Maryland enacted the first tax targeting digital advertising in the United States. The scaled rate between 2.5% and 10% Digital Advertising Gross Revenues Tax will be imposed on annual gross revenues derived from digital advertising services in Maryland. The rate of tax varies depending on the amount of revenue a company earns. However, pending legislation would exempt digital advertising by a \u2018broadcast entity\u2019 or a \u2018news media entity.\u2019 Maryland\u2019s new digital advertising tax could be the beginning of a wave of similar new taxes on digital advertising enacted by other states that are experiencing budget shortfalls and economic distress as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic\nAdditional Risks Related to Our Business\nOur business is subject to seasonal and other fluctuations, which affects our revenues and operating results.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations that we expect to continue to be reflected in our operating results in future periods. Our first fiscal quarter of the year tends to be our weakest quarter because advertising volume is at its lowest levels following the December holiday season. Correspondingly, our second and fourth fiscal quarters tend to be our strongest because they include heavy holiday and seasonal advertising. Other factors that affect our quarterly revenues and operating results may be beyond our control, including changes in the pricing policies of our competitors, the hiring and retention of key personnel, wage and cost pressures, distribution costs, changes in newsprint prices and general economic factors.\nThe value of our intangible assets may become impaired, which could adversely affect future reported results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity\nOur goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which include mastheads, are subject to annual impairment testing, and more frequent testing upon the occurrence of certain events or significant changes in our circumstances, to determine whether the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying value. In such a case, a non-cash charge to earnings may be necessary in the relevant period, which could adversely affect future reported results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity. At December 31, 2020, the carrying value of our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and amortizable intangible assets was $534.1 million, $171.4 million and $653.2 million, respectively.\nConsistent with past practice, we performed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of 2020. In connection with our review, we noted that the market capitalization of the Company declined significantly during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and there was widespread stock-market volatility, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, in the second quarter of 2020, we recognized impairment charges of $362.4 million, $8.0 million, and $23.0 million related to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets (mastheads) and amortizable intangible assets, respectively.\nManagement assumptions used to calculate fair value are highly subjective and involve forecasts of future economic and market conditions and their impact on operating performance. Changes in key assumptions impacting the analyses could result in the recognition of additional impairment. The severity and length of the COVID-19 pandemic, the duration and extent of the mitigation measures and governmental actions designed to combat the pandemic, as well as the changes in customers behavior as a result of the pandemic, all of which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict at the current time, could negatively impact our future assessment of projected results of operations and the underlying assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the reporting units and related mastheads.\nOur management and independent auditors have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which could, if not remediated in an appropriate and timely way, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules and regulations require that management report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and assess the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on a quarterly basis. Maintaining and adapting our internal controls is expensive and requires significant management attention. Moreover, as we continue to grow, our internal controls may become more complex and require additional resources to ensure they remain effective amid dynamic regulatory and other guidance.\nAs described in Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and that we had, as of such date, a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to internal control deficiencies over the revenue recognition process; specifically, the Company did not maintain effective controls due to the aggregation of control deficiencies related to inadequate manual preventative and detective controls and information technology general controls. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. This material weakness identified did not result in any adjustments or restatements of our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements or disclosures for any prior period previously reported by the Company. However, until the material weakness is remediated, and our associated disclosure controls and procedures improved, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting occur in the future, our future consolidated financial statements or other information filed with the SEC may contain material misstatements.\nWe are in the process of remediating the material weakness, however if we are unable to remediate the material weakness in an appropriate and timely manner, or if we identify additional control deficiencies that individually or together constitute significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, our ability to accurately record, process, and report financial information and consequently, our ability to prepare financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected. Failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements, violations of applicable securities laws, stock exchange listing requirements, and the covenants under our debt agreements, subject us to litigation and investigations, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements, and adversely impact our stock price and ability to access capital markets.\nWe are evaluating and developing a plan, which will include the implementation of appropriate processes and controls to remediate the material weakness described above. While we work toward the design and implementation of these processes and\ncontrols, we may rely significantly on manual procedures to assist us with meeting the objectives otherwise fulfilled by an effective control environment. The implementation of new procedures and controls could be costly and distract management from other activities.\nWe may not be able to protect intellectual property rights upon which our business relies and, if we lose intellectual property protection, our assets may lose value.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, including, but not limited to, our titles, mastheads, content and proprietary software, which we may attempt to protect through patents, copyrights, trade laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements. We believe our proprietary and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and our competitive position.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our content, services and other intellectual property, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent any misappropriation or confusion among consumers and merchants, or unauthorized use of these rights. If we are unable to procure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, we may not realize the full value of these assets, and our business may suffer. If we must litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of third parties, such litigation may be costly and divert the attention of our management from day-to-day operations.\nWe are subject to environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations that could cause us to incur significant compliance expenditures and liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the environment, storage tanks and the management and disposal of wastes at our facilities. Under various environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for contamination resulting from the release or threatened release of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum at that property. Such laws often impose liability on the owner or operator without regard to fault, and the costs of any required investigation or cleanup can be substantial. Although in connection with certain of our acquisitions we have rights to indemnification for certain environmental liabilities, these rights may not be sufficient to reimburse us for all losses that we might incur if a property acquired by us has environmental contamination. In addition, although in connection with certain of our acquisitions we have obtained insurance policies for coverage for certain potential environmental liabilities, these policies have express exclusions to coverage as well as express limits on amounts of coverage and length of term. Accordingly, these insurance policies may not be sufficient to provide coverage for us for all losses that we might incur if a property acquired by us has environmental contamination.\nOur operations are also subject to various employee safety and health laws and regulations, including those pertaining to occupational injury and illness, employee exposure to hazardous materials and employee complaints. Environmental and employee safety and health laws tend to be complex, comprehensive and frequently changing. As a result, we may be involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings and investigations related to environmental and employee safety and health issues. These proceedings and investigations could result in substantial costs to us, divert our management\u2019s attention and adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop our real property. Furthermore, if it is determined that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or if our properties are contaminated, it could result in significant liabilities, fines or the suspension or interruption of the operations of specific printing facilities.\nFuture events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, new laws or regulations or the discovery of conditions not currently known to us, may give rise to additional compliance or remedial costs that could be material.\nOur possession and use of personal information and the use of payment cards by our customers present risks and expenses that could harm our business. Unauthorized access to or disclosure or manipulation of such data, whether through breach of our network security or otherwise, could expose us to liabilities and costly litigation and damage our reputation.\nOur online systems store and process confidential subscriber and other sensitive data, such as names, email addresses, addresses, and other personal information. Therefore, maintaining our network security is critical. Additionally, we depend on the security of our third-party service providers. Unauthorized use of or inappropriate access to our, or our third-party service providers\u2019 networks, computer systems and services could potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information, including payment card (credit or debit) information, of our customers. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we or our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Non-technical means, for example actions by an employee, can also result in a data breach. A party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our proprietary information or the information of our\ncustomers or users, cause interruption in our operations, or damage our computers or those of our customers or users. As a result of any such breaches, customers or users may assert claims of liability against us and these activities may subject us to legal claims, adversely impact our reputation, and interfere with our ability to provide our products and services, all of which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The coverage and limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.\nA significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their payment card accounts directly for all amounts charged by us. These customers provide payment card information and other personally identifiable information which, depending on the particular payment plan, may be maintained to facilitate future payment card transactions. Under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, we could be liable to the banks that issue the payment cards for their related expenses and penalties. In addition, if we fail to follow payment card industry data security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer information, we could incur significant fines or lose our ability to give our customers the option of using payment cards. If we were unable to accept payment cards, our business would be seriously harmed.\nThere can be no assurance that any security measures we, or our third-party service providers, take will be effective in preventing a data breach. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose customers or users. Failure to protect confidential customer data or to provide customers with adequate notice of our privacy policies could also subject us to liabilities imposed by United States federal and state regulatory agencies or courts. We could also be subject to evolving state laws that impose data breach notification requirements, specific data security obligations, or other customer privacy-related requirements. Our failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPrivacy-related laws are constantly evolving and may increase our compliance costs and potential for liability, either of which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany jurisdictions have enacted or are considering enacting privacy or data protection laws and regulations that apply to the processing or protection of personal information. These laws and regulations may impose additional security breach notification requirements, notice and consent requirements and specific data security obligations, and may also provide for a private right of action or statutory damages. The compliance costs and operational burdens imposed by these laws and regulations could be significant. Failure to protect confidential data, provide individuals with adequate notice of our privacy policies or obtain required valid consent, could subject us to liabilities imposed by the jurisdictions where we operate. Further, because some of our products and services are available on the internet, we may be subject to laws or regulations exposing us to liability or compliance obligations even in jurisdictions where we do not have a substantial presence.\nExisting privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and are subject to potentially differing interpretations. Various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies, as well as foreign legislative and regulatory bodies, may expand current laws or enact new laws regarding privacy and data protection. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation adopted by the European Union imposes stringent data protection requirements and significant penalties for noncompliance; California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act creates new data privacy rights; and the European Union\u2019s anticipated ePrivacy Regulation is expected to impose, with respect to electronic communications, stricter data protection and data processing requirements. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us or the third parties upon which we rely to comply with laws and regulations that govern our business operations, as well as any failure, or perceived failure, by us or the third parties upon which we rely to comply with our own posted policies, could result in claims against us by governmental entities or others, negative publicity and a loss of confidence in us by our users and advertisers. Each of these potential consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe could incur significant liability if the separation of Legacy Gannett from its former parent were determined to be a taxable transaction.\nIn connection with the separation of Legacy Gannett from its former parent, Legacy Gannett\u2019s former parent received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the requirements for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\") would be satisfied. The opinion relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations, and undertakings from Legacy Gannett's former parent and Legacy Gannett regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings were incorrect or not satisfied, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Further, notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the IRS could determine upon\naudit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings were incorrect or violated, if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of Legacy Gannett or its former parent after the separation. If the separation were determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Legacy Gannett\u2019s former parent and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, and we could incur significant liabilities.\nThe Internal Revenue Service may disallow all or part of a worthless stock loss and bad debt deduction.\nThe IRS could challenge an election made in 2017 to treat one of our ReachLocal international subsidiaries as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which resulted in worthless stock and bad debt deductions of $101.0 million, yielding a tax benefit of $32.0 million. These tax deductions are subject to audit and possible adjustment by the IRS, which could result in the reversal of all or part of the income tax benefit. To account for this uncertainty, a reserve of $11.0 million has been established to reduce the benefit to an estimated realizable value of $21.0 million. While we believe this represents our best estimate of the benefit to be realized upon final acceptance of our tax return, the IRS could reject or reduce the amount of tax benefit related to these deductions. If the IRS rejects or reduces the amount of this income tax benefit, we may have to pay additional cash income taxes, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We cannot guarantee what the ultimate outcome or amount of the benefit we receive, if any, will be.\nWe may not be able to generate future taxable income which may prevent our realization of deferred tax assets.\nWe have deferred tax assets reported on our balance sheet, net of valuation allowances of $83.4 million. If we do not have taxable income in future years, we may be required to reestablish a valuation allowance against the remaining deferred tax assets.\nRisks Related to Pension Obligations and Employees\nWe are required to use a portion of our cash flows to make contributions to our pension plans, which diverts cash flow from operations, and the amount of required future contributions may be difficult to estimate.\nWe, along with our subsidiaries, sponsor various defined benefit retirement plans, including plans established under collective bargaining agreements. Our retirement plans include (i) the Gannett Retirement Plan (\"GR Plan\"), (ii) the Newsquest and Romanes Pension Schemes in the U.K. (\"U.K. Pension Plans\"), (iii) the Newspaper Guild of Detroit Pension Plan, (iv) the George W. Prescott Publishing Company Pension Plan (the \"GWP Plan\") and (v) the Times Publishing Company Defined Benefit Pension Plan (the \"TPC Plan\").\nOur pension plans invest in a variety of equity and debt securities. Future volatility and disruption in the equity and bond markets could cause declines in the asset values of our pension plans. As of December 31, 2020, the value of our pension assets exceeded our pension benefit obligations and our retirement plans were overfunded by a total of $64.2 million on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") basis.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we made a $5.0 million contribution to the GR Plan and we have committed to make quarterly contributions of $5.0 million to the GR Plan through September 2022. Our ability to make contribution payments will depend on our future cash flows, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory, and other factors beyond our control. Various factors, including future investment returns, interest rates, and potential pension legislative changes, may impact the timing and amount of future pension contributions. In addition, decreases in the discount rate used to determine minimum funding requirements could result in increased future contributions. As a result, we may need to make additional pension contributions above what is currently estimated, which could reduce the cash available for our businesses.\nWe depend on key personnel, and we may not be able to operate or grow our business effectively if we lose the services of any of our key personnel or are unable to attract qualified personnel in the future.\nThe success of our business is heavily dependent on our ability to retain our management and other key personnel and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Competition for senior management personnel is intense, and we may not be able to retain our key personnel. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our key personnel, these agreements do not ensure that our key personnel will continue in their present capacity with us for any particular period of time. We do not have key employee insurance for any of our current management or other key personnel. The loss of any key personnel would require our remaining key personnel to divert immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement. An inability to find a suitable replacement for any departing executive officer on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to operate or grow our business.\nA shortage of skilled or experienced employees, including journalists, in the media industry, or our inability to retain such employees, could pose a risk to achieving improved productivity and reducing costs, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nProduction and distribution of our various publications requires skilled and experienced employees, including journalists. A shortage of such employees, or our inability to retain such employees, could have an adverse impact on our productivity and costs, our ability to expand, develop and distribute new products and our entry into new markets. The cost of retaining or hiring such employees could exceed our expectations, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nA number of our employees are unionized, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if current or additional labor negotiations or contracts were to further restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we employed 18,141 employees, of whom 2,356 (or approximately 15%) were represented by seven unions. 43% of the unionized employees are in four states: Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and Indiana and represent 14%, 7%, 13% and 10% of all our union employees, respectively.\nAlthough our newspapers have not experienced a union strike in the recent past nor do we anticipate a union strike to occur, we cannot preclude the possibility that a strike may occur at one or more of our newspapers at some point in the future. We believe that, in the event of a newspaper strike, we would be able to continue to publish and deliver to subscribers, which is critical to retaining advertising and circulation revenues, although there can be no assurance of this. Further, settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can have unknown effects on our labor costs, productivity and flexibility.\nSustained increases in costs of employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability.\nIn recent years, we have experienced significant increases in the cost of employee benefits because of economic factors beyond our control, including increases in health care costs. Some of these factors may continue to put upward pressure on the cost of providing medical benefits. Although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses.\nRisks Related to the Termination of our Relationship with our Former Manager\nOur inability to successfully transition to self-management following termination of the Amended Management Agreement may result in the loss of key employees, disruptions to our business and operational inefficiencies that could hinder our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn December 21, 2020, we terminated the Amended Management Agreement, effective as of 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 31, 2020. Until the termination of the Amended Management Agreement, we were dependent on the Manager and its affiliates to manage our operations, and acquire and manage our investments. After the termination, we are self-managing our operations and investments. Achieving the anticipated benefits from the termination of the Amended Management Agreement is subject to a number of uncertainties related to our successful transition to self-management.\nIn connection with the Termination Agreement, we extended offers of employment to certain employees of the Manager or its affiliates who provided services to us prior to the termination, including our Chief Executive Officer. While the extension of\nsuch offers of employment are intended to mitigate any disruption in the transition from being Manager-operated to self-managed, this transition has inherent risks, including, but not limited to, whether we can successfully retain key employees and successfully transition our management from external to in-house.\nTransitioning to self-management may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than anticipated. We may experience business disruptions and operational inefficiencies during such transition if such transition is more difficult or more costly than we anticipate or if the transition is otherwise inefficient or unsuccessful to any degree. As a result, we could experience material adverse effects to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Manager is not liable to us for certain acts or omissions performed in accordance with, and prior to the termination of, the Amended Management Agreement, and for certain matters in connection with the termination of our relationship with the Manager, and we may incur liability for such acts or omissions.\nPursuant to, and prior to the termination of, the Amended Management Agreement, the Manager assumed no responsibility other than to render the services called for thereunder in good faith and was not responsible for any action of our Board of Directors in following or declining to follow its advice or recommendations. The Manager, its members, managers, officers and employees are not liable to us or any of our subsidiaries, to our Board of Directors, or our or any subsidiary\u2019s stockholders or partners for any acts or omissions by the Manager, its members, managers, officers or employees, except by reason of acts constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the Manager\u2019s duties under the Amended Management Agreement that occurred prior to its termination. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, our indemnification obligations to the Manager and its affiliates under the Amended Management Agreement survive its termination indefinitely. In addition, pursuant to the Termination Agreement, the Manager will be held harmless with respect to certain acts and omissions performed in connection with the Termination Agreement except by reason of acts or omissions constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the Manager\u2019s performance under the Termination Agreement. As a result, we may incur liabilities as a result of certain acts or omissions by the Manager, which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThere can be no assurance that the market for our stock will provide adequate liquidity.\nThe market price of our Common Stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation:\n\u2022Risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022Our business profile and market capitalization may not fit the investment objectives of any stockholder;\n\u2022A shift in our investor base;\n\u2022Our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other comparable companies;\n\u2022Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022Changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022Risks relating to our ability to meet long-term forecasts;\n\u2022Announcements by us or our competitors of significant investments, acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022The failure of securities analysts to cover our Common Stock;\n\u2022Changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022The operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022Negative public perception of us, our competitors, or industry;\n\u2022Overall market fluctuations; and\n\u2022General economic conditions.\nStock markets in general and recently have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock. Additionally, these and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our Common Stock to fluctuate, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of Common Stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Common Stock.\nOur Common Stock may be delisted from the NYSE if we fail to comply with continued listing standards.\nOur Common Stock currently trades on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\"), and the continued listing of our Common Stock on the NYSE is subject to our compliance with a number of listing standards, including minimum share price requirements. If we fall out of compliance with NYSE\u2019s listing standards and fail to regain compliance within the applicable cure periods, our Common Stock may be delisted from the NYSE. Failure to maintain our NYSE listing could negatively impact us and our stockholders by reducing the willingness of investors to hold our Common Stock because of the resulting decreased price, liquidity and trading of our Common Stock, and analyst coverage, among others.\nSales or issuances of shares of our Common Stock, including upon conversion of the 2027 Notes, could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nSales or issuances of substantial amounts of shares of our Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales or issuances might occur, could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. The issuance of our Common Stock in connection with property, portfolio or business acquisitions or the settlement of awards that may be granted under our Incentive Plans (as defined below) or otherwise could also have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nIn accordance with the Investor Agreement among the Company and the holders of the 2027 Notes (the \u201cHolders\u201d) establishing certain terms and conditions concerning the rights and restrictions on the Holders with respect to the Holders\u2019 ownership of the Notes, the Holders have certain registration rights with respect to the shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of the 2027 Notes. In addition, Holders who receive Common Stock upon conversion of the 2027 Notes may be able to sell these shares of Common Stock pursuant to any applicable exemption under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules promulgated thereunder, including Rule 144, if applicable. If significant quantities of the Common Stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they may be sold, the trading price of the Common Stock could be adversely affected.\nWe presently have no intention to declare or pay a dividend and we may not be able to pay dividends in the future or at all.\nOn April 1, 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors determined that it is in the best interests of our stockholders for the Company to preserve liquidity by suspending our quarterly dividend. We presently have no intention to reinstate the dividend, and there can be no assurance that we will resume paying dividends on a regular basis.\nOur credit facility contains terms that restrict our ability to pay dividends or other distributions. In addition, under the 5-Year Term Loan, we can only pay cash dividends up to an agreed-upon amount and provided that the ratio of Total Indebtedness secured on an equal priority basis with the 5-Year Term Loan (net of Unrestricted Cash) to Consolidated EBITDA (as such terms are defined in the 5-Year Term Loan) does not exceed a specified ratio. The Indenture contains a similar dividend restriction and also provides that, at any time that the Company\u2019s Total Gross Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Indenture) exceeds 1.5 and the Company approves the declaration of a dividend, the Company must offer to purchase a principal amount of 2027 Notes equal to the proposed amount of the dividend. This repurchase offer requirement may make it impractical to declare and pay dividends at any time that the requirement is in effect. Stockholders also should be aware that they have no contractual or other legal right to dividends that have not been declared.\nAny determination by our Board of Directors regarding dividends will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company\u2019s GAAP net income, free cash flow generated from operations or other sources, liquidity position and potential alternative uses of cash, such as acquisitions, as well as economic conditions and expected future financial results. There can be no guarantee regarding the timing and amount of any dividends. Our ability to resume payment of dividends in the future will depend on our future financial performance, which, in turn, depends on the successful implementation of our strategy and on financial, competitive, regulatory, technical and other factors, general economic conditions, demand and selling prices for our products and other factors specific to our industry or specific projects, many of which are beyond our control. Therefore, our ability to generate free cash flow depends on the performance of our operations and could be limited by decreases in our profitability or increases in costs, capital expenditures, or debt servicing requirements.\nThe percentage ownership of our existing stockholders may be diluted in the future, including upon conversion of the 2027 Notes.\nWe have issued and may continue to issue equity in order to raise capital or in connection with future acquisitions and strategic investments, which would dilute investors\u2019 percentage ownership in Gannett. In addition, a stockholder's percentage ownership may be diluted if we issue equity instruments such as debt and equity financing.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities (such as the 2027 Notes), a stockholder's ownership interest in our Company may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Debt and equity financings, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as redeeming our shares, making investments, incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, declaring dividends or placing limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights.\nThe percentage ownership of our existing stockholders may be diluted in the future as result of the issuance of Common Stock due to conversion of the 2027 Notes. Each 2027 Note may be converted into shares of Common Stock at an initial conversion rate of 200 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (subject to adjustment as provided in the Indenture, the \u201cConversion Rate\u201d). Based on the number of shares outstanding on February 19, 2021, conversion of all of the 2027 Notes into Common Stock (assuming no adjustments to the Conversion Rate) would result in the issuance of an aggregate of 99,418,800 shares of the Common Stock representing approximately 42% of the shares outstanding as of February 19, 2021 and conversion of all of the 2027 Notes into Common Stock (assuming the maximum increase in the Conversion Rate as a result of certain events, including, subject to exceptions as described in the Indenture, the acquisition of 50% or more of voting power of our securities by a person or group, a stockholder-approved liquidation of us, the delisting of our common stock, or certain changes of control, but no other adjustments to the Conversion Rate) would result in the issuance of an aggregate of 294,153,187 shares of the Common Stock representing approximately 68% of the shares outstanding as of February 19, 2021. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2027 Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2027 Notes could be used to satisfy short positions. Further, the anticipated conversion of the 2027 Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nThe percentage ownership of our existing stockholders may also be diluted in the future as result of the issuance of Common Stock upon the exercise of outstanding 10-year warrants (the \"Gannett Warrants\"). As of December 31, 2020, the Gannett Warrants, if exercised, would represent approximately 0.6% of our Common Stock outstanding at a strike price of $46.35.\nFurthermore, the percentage ownership in Gannett may be diluted in the future because of options issued to our Manager. As of December 31, 2020, there were 6,068,075 options outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of $13.97 held by our Manager and/or its affiliates.\nDilution may also result from the issuances of shares under our equity compensation plans (our \"Incentive Plans\"), which provide for the grant of equity and equity-based awards, including restricted stock, stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance awards, and other equity-based and non-equity based awards, in each case to our directors, officers, employees, among others. As of December 31, 2020, the number of shares remaining available for future issuance under our Incentive Plans, excluding shares to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights, was 18.6 million.\nAn \"ownership change\" could limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes, which could result in our payment of income taxes earlier than if we were able to fully utilize our net operating loss and other tax benefit carryforwards.\nFederal and state tax laws impose restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards and other tax attributes in the event of an \"ownership change\" as defined by Section 382 of the Code (\"Section 382\"). Generally, an \"ownership change\" occurs if the percentage of the value of the stock that is owned by one or more direct or indirect \"five percent stockholders\" increases by more than 50% over their lowest ownership percentage at any time during an applicable testing period (typically, three years). Under Section 382, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change,\" such corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. While no \"ownership change\" has resulted in annual limitations, future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an \"ownership change.\" In addition, future equity offerings or acquisitions that have equity as a component of the consideration could result in an \"ownership change.\" Furthermore, the issuance of Common Stock upon the conversion of the 2027 Notes (in the event we elect to issue Common Stock upon any such conversions, rather than cash), may trigger an \"ownership change.\" If an \"ownership change\" occurs in the future, utilization of our NOL carryforwards or other tax attributes may be limited, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. We have adopted a Section 382 Rights Agreement, discussed below, to protect our utilization of our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes.\nWe have entered into a Section 382 Rights Agreement, and if the share purchase rights issued pursuant to such agreement are exercised, it could materially and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe entered into a Section 382 Rights Agreement on April 6, 2020 (the \"Rights Agreement\"), with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, a federally chartered trust company, as Rights Agent. The Rights Agreement is intended to discourage acquisitions of our Common Stock which could result in a cumulative \"ownership change\" as defined under Section 382, thereby preserving our current ability to utilize NOL carryforwards to offset future income tax obligations, which would become subject to limitations if we were to experience an \"ownership change,\" as defined under Section 382. While the Rights Agreement is intended to preserve our current ability to utilize NOL carryforwards, it effectively deters current and future purchasers from accumulating more than 4.99% of our Common Stock, which could delay or discourage takeover attempts that our stockholders may consider favorable. An Acquiring Person, as defined in the Rights Agreement, that acquires 4.99% or more of our Common Stock could suffer substantial dilution of its ownership interest under the terms of the Rights Agreement through the issuance of Common Stock or common stock equivalents to all stockholders other than the Acquiring Person. In addition, if the share purchase rights issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement are exercised, additional shares of our Common Stock will be issued, which could materially and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. Moreover, sales in the public market of any shares of our Common Stock issued upon such exercise, or the perception that such sales may occur, could also adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. These issuances may also cause our per share net income, if any, to decrease in future periods.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and of Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could decrease the trading price of our Common Stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the raider and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions provide for:\n\u2022Amendment of provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws regarding the election of directors, the term of office of directors, the filling of director vacancies and the resignation and removal of directors only upon the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the then issued and outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote thereon;\n\u2022Amendment of provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding corporate opportunity only upon the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the then issued and outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote thereon;\n\u2022Removal of directors only for cause and only with the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote in the election of directors;\n\u2022Our Board to determine the powers, preferences and rights of our preferred stock and to issue such preferred stock without stockholder approval, including in connection with our Rights Agreement;\n\u2022Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws prevent stockholders from calling special meetings of our stockholders;\n\u2022Advance notice requirements applicable to stockholders for director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings;\n\u2022A prohibition, in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, stating that no holder of shares of our Common Stock will have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors, which means that the holders of majority of the issued and outstanding shares of our Common Stock can elect all the directors standing for election; and\n\u2022Action by our stockholders outside a meeting, in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, only by unanimous written consent.\nPublic stockholders who might desire to participate in these types of transactions may not have an opportunity to do so, even if the transaction is considered favorable to stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control or a change in our management and Board and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock and your ability to realize any potential change of control premium.\nFuture offerings of debt securities, which would rank senior to our Common Stock upon our liquidation, and future offerings of equity securities, may be senior to our Common Stock for the purposes of dividend and liquidating distributions, may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe may raise additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities (including preferred stock) from time to time. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities (including holders of our 2027 Notes) and preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings (including the lenders under our existing senior secured credit facility with Apollo) will be entitled to our available assets prior to the holders of our Common Stock. Preferred stock could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our Common Stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our Common Stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in us.", "PERMNO": 14490, "SIC": 2711, "TIC": "GCI"}
