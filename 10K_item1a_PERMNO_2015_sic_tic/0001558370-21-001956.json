{"cik": "1040829", "company": "Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following specific risk factors as well as the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as these are important factors, among others, that could cause our actual results to differ from our expected or historical results. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all our potential risks or uncertainties. Some statements in the \u201cBusiness\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d and are qualified by the cautionary language regarding such statements. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d above.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. Depending on its length and severity, the COVID-19 pandemic may also have an adverse effect on our access to financial markets and our ability to service our indebtedness.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented restrictions on travel, group gatherings and non-essential activities, including orders and guidance issued by U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities, such as \u201csocial distancing\u201d guidance and Safer at Home orders. There have also been significant business closures and a substantial reduction in economic activity in the United States as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the phased reopening of the U.S. economy and the growing availability of vaccines, significant uncertainty remains as to the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. economy as a whole, our businesses, and the lodging and entertainment industries. The longer and more severe the pandemic, the greater the material adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, cash flows and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. Further, depending on its duration and severity, the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse effect on our access to financial markets and our ability to service or refinance our indebtedness.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruption to our business and we, working with our hotel manager, Marriott, suspended operations at our Gaylord Hotels properties and substantially all of our entertainment assets by late March 2020. We have not yet reopened all of our assets, and most of our assets are operating at limited capacity. We have taken steps to conserve our liquidity and contain costs, including suspending our regular quarterly cash dividend payments to stockholders, deferring most non-essential capital projects, including our previously announced expansion at Gaylord Rockies, and obtaining waivers under and amendments to our Credit Agreement as described below, but we cannot be certain that these efforts will be sufficient to sustain our business through the pandemic.\nWhile we were successful in amending our Credit Agreement to obtain waivers of the financial covenants and the Gaylord Rockies Loan to obtain certain other favorable modifications, as described under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Principal Debt Agreements,\u201d the Amendments also increased the interest rates under our Revolver and Term Loan A, and imposed additional restrictions on debt, investments, dividends, share repurchases and capital expenditures, and included a minimum liquidity requirement, which will increase our interest costs and impose constraints on the manner in which we do business. The amendment to the Gaylord Rockies Loan also includes restrictions on distributions to the owners of the Gaylord Rockies joint venture and requires a certain level of equity financing for a Gaylord Rockies expansion, which may increase the cost of pursuing the previously announced expansion of Gaylord Rockies. The restrictions in these agreements may prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities available to us. In the future, our access to and cost\nof financing will depend on, among other things, global economic conditions, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, our prospects and our credit ratings. Certain of our credit ratings have been downgraded during 2020, and if our credit ratings were to be further downgraded, or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels, our industry or us, our access to capital and the cost and terms of any debt financing would be negatively affected.\nThe material adverse effect of the pandemic on our businesses will continue during such time as any of our assets remain closed (including Gaylord National) and during phased reopenings and may continue after that time. We cannot predict how soon we will be able to fully reopen all of our Gaylord Hotels properties or our entertainment assets and operate at normal capacity when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, as our ability to reopen and to resume normal operations will depend in part on the actions of a number of governmental authorities over which we have no control. Modified social distancing requirements or recommendations have altered the way we do business during reopening, and changes may persist for an extended period of time. For example, we have implemented additional safety and cleaning protocols, and these and other changes may result in higher costs and lower profit margins at our assets. Changes we make in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our business, our brand reputation and ability to attract and retain employees. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we could still experience long-term impacts on our operating costs as a result of steps we may take to counteract future outbreaks of COVID-19 or other viruses through, for example, enhanced health and hygiene requirements or other such measures in one or more properties. Some of our businesses, such as the ticketed performances at the Grand Ole Opry and Ryman Auditorium may be held at limited capacity for an extended period of time during reopening. Of our Gaylord Hotels properties, Gaylord National remains closed. As a result, our revenues and consolidated financial results and results of operations for periods in which our operations are subject to capacity limits and in which Gaylord National remains closed will not be comparable with periods prior to the pandemic. We have experienced a significant decline in occupancy, RevPAR and Total RevPAR and other metrics at our Gaylord Hotels properties that have reopened, and those and other declines associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may continue.\nDepending on the severity of the pandemic and our business levels, we cannot assure you that we will not make the decision to temporarily reclose any of our Gaylord Hotels properties or our entertainment assets in response to further outbreaks of COVID-19, including new variants of the virus.\nFurther, we cannot predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on third parties with whom we do business, including meeting planners, Marriott, our manager, other third-party service providers, travel agencies, suppliers and other vendors, and the degree to which the impact on third parties will affect our business. To the extent these third parties are severely impacted, it may harm our business or change the way we operate.\nThe pace of recovery in demand and business levels following the reopening of our Gaylord Hotels properties may be affected by adverse economic conditions, including job losses, corporate financial performance, group customers\u2019 spending and meeting budget constraints, debt loads, diminished business travel and other factors. For our managed assets, we will rely on Marriott to safely reopen, to operate these assets in a manner consistent with their obligations under their management agreements with us and to increase business levels at our properties, whether by rebooking cancelled stays for future periods or otherwise, and we cannot assure you that Marriott will be successful in doing so. Further, room bookings for future periods may yet be cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot assure you that Marriott will be successful in rebooking cancellations for future periods or that groups that have already rebooked to future periods will fulfill their stays. Moreover, once restrictions are relaxed or lifted, it is unclear whether consumer demand for convention center resorts, business travel, group meetings, leisure travel and country music entertainment experiences will return, in part, because we cannot predict the levels of consumer confidence in the safety of travel and group gatherings following the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we have implemented new hygiene and cleaning standards, we cannot fully predict their impact on customers\u2019 or meeting planners\u2019 beliefs as to whether it is safe to travel and meet in groups. We cannot predict the pace of recovery of our Gaylord Hotels properties and other assets, or the timing of a return to pre-pandemic demand, occupancy, business mix or pricing.\nIf we determine the carrying value of our assets are not recoverable through the future cash flows associated with those assets, we could have to recognize significant non-cash impairment charges to our results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in significant financial market volatility and uncertainty, including on the market price of our common stock. A continuation or worsening of the levels of market disruption and volatility seen during the pandemic could have a further adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or our debt securities.\nThe extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the hospitality industry at large remains highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the outbreak, the timing and availability of vaccinations and treatments to combat COVID-19, whether or not a recession occurs in the United States or globally, the state of the financial markets and the length of time it takes for demand and pricing to recover and stabilize, particularly in the large group meeting segment of the lodging industry, and normal economic and operating conditions to resume. Given the uncertainty as to the extent and timing of the potential future spread or mitigation of COVID-19 and the impositions or relaxation of protective measures, we are presently unable to estimate the full impact to our future business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nThe potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic also could intensify or otherwise affect many of our other risk factors that are included in \u201cPart I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent filings, including, but not limited to, risks inherent in the hospitality industry, macroeconomic factors beyond our control, competition for hotel guests, meeting customers and customers to our entertainment assets, risks related to doing business with third parties, including vendors and suppliers, performance of our information technology systems and risks related to our indebtedness. Because the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and continuously evolving, the other potential impacts to our risk factors contained herein and that are further described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are uncertain.\nIf Marriott or any future third-party hotel manager does not manage our hotel properties or other businesses successfully, our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders may be negatively impacted.\nDue to federal income tax laws that restrict REITs from operating and managing hotels, we do not operate or manage the day-to-day functions of any of our hotel properties as a REIT. We lease or sublease our hotel properties to TRSs, and such TRS lessees have engaged Marriott as a third-party hotel manager pursuant to hotel management agreements. Marriott manages the day-to-day operations of our Gaylord Hotels properties, as well as the Inn at Opryland and the AC Hotel. We will identify third-party hotel managers to operate and manage any hotels that we acquire in the future. Our third-party hotel managers are responsible for the day-to-day management of our hotel properties, including, but not limited to, implementing significant operating decisions, setting rates for rooms and meeting space, controlling revenue and expenditures, collecting accounts receivable, and recruiting, employing and supervising employees at our hotel properties. We do not have the authority to require our third-party hotel managers to operate our hotel properties in a particular manner, although we have consent and approval rights for certain matters under our hotel management agreements with Marriott, subject to the limitations described therein. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders are largely dependent on the ability of our third-party hotel managers to operate our hotel properties successfully. Any failure by our third-party hotel managers to provide quality services and amenities or to maintain and protect a quality brand name and reputation could have a negative impact on their ability to operate and manage our hotel properties successfully and could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders.\nWe cannot assure you that our third-party hotel managers will operate and manage our hotel properties in a manner that is consistent with their obligations under the hotel management agreements, that our third-party hotel managers will not be negligent in their performance or engage in other criminal or fraudulent activity, or that they will not otherwise default on their management obligations to us.\nEven if we believe our hotel properties are being operated inefficiently or in a manner that does not result in satisfactory operational metrics, we will have limited ability to require our third-party hotel managers to change their method of operation of our hotel properties. We generally will attempt to resolve issues with third-party hotel managers through discussions and negotiations. However, if we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and\nnegotiations, we may choose to litigate the dispute or submit the matter to third-party dispute resolution or arbitration. We would be able to seek redress only if a third-party hotel manager violates the terms of the applicable hotel management agreement, and then only to the extent of the remedies provided for under the terms of the hotel management agreement. Additionally, in the event we need to replace any of our third-party hotel managers, we may experience significant business disruptions at the affected hotel properties, and may be liable, under certain circumstances, for significant damages and/or be required to make certain payments to our third-party managers.\nThe operation and management of our current hotel properties, the operation of which generates substantially all our Hospitality segment revenue, is concentrated in Marriott.\nOur current hotel properties, the operation of which generates substantially all our Hospitality segment revenue, are operated and managed by Marriott. As a result, our operational risk is concentrated in one third-party hotel manager, which makes us more vulnerable economically to any weakness of Marriott than if we entered into hotel management agreements with several third-party hotel managers. We cannot assure you that Marriott will satisfy its obligations to us or successfully operate and manage our current hotel properties. Any adverse developments in Marriott\u2019s business and affairs, financial strength or ability to operate and manage our current hotel properties successfully could materially reduce our revenues and net income, which could in turn reduce the amount of distributions to our stockholders. Additionally, we rely on the resources of and financial information provided by Marriott to report the financial results of our hotel properties. A failure by Marriott to accurately report the financial results of our hotel properties could materially affect our understanding of the hotel properties\u2019 performance as well as our ability to accurately report on the hotel properties\u2019 performance. Further, Marriott now owns the Gaylord Hotels brand and trademarks, and a failure on their part to maintain quality standards could harm the brand and damage our business.\nRevenue growth and cost synergies for our hotel operations are largely dependent on the efforts of Marriott. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Marriott\u2019s efforts to leverage its rewards program, customer channels and brands, as well as its management of demand for rooms, meeting space and banquets, resulted in revenue growth and Marriott\u2019s efforts to reduce hotel-level costs yielded cost savings. There can be no assurance that improvements in revenue or cost savings can be achieved by Marriott during a recovery or after the COVID-19 pandemic ends or that they thereafter can be sustained.\nRestrictive covenants and other provisions in our hotel management agreements with third-party hotel managers could limit our ability to sell or lease our hotel properties or refinance our existing debt.\nOur hotel management agreements with Marriott contain, and we anticipate that hotel management agreements with our future third-party hotel managers will contain, restrictive covenants that limit our flexibility to sell or lease our hotel properties. For example, we may not sell or lease our current hotel properties to a competitor of Marriott (as defined in our management agreements with Marriott), and any purchaser or lessee must have, in Marriott\u2019s judgment, sufficient financial resources and liquidity to fulfill our obligations under the hotel management agreements. Such restrictions on our ability to sell or lease our hotel properties could negatively affect the marketability of our hotel properties and restrict our ability to refinance our existing debt secured by our hotel properties.\nMarriott and any future third-party hotel manager may own or operate hotels that compete with our hotel properties.\nOur third-party hotel managers may own or operate hotels that compete with our current hotel properties and any hotel properties that we acquire, which may result in a conflict of interest. For example, Marriott and its affiliates own, have invested in, operate, and have provided credit support or operating guarantees to hotels that compete or will compete with our current hotel properties, including the Marriott Orlando World Center, which competes with Gaylord Palms, and the Washington Marriott Marquis, which competes with Gaylord National. As a result, our third-party hotel managers may make decisions regarding competing hotel properties that are not or would not be in our best interest. In addition, such third-party hotel managers\u2019 operation of other hotels may divert attention away from the operation and management of our hotel properties.\nOur concentration in the hospitality industry, and in particular the group-oriented meetings sector of the hospitality industry, exposes us to certain risks outside of our and Marriott\u2019s control.\nOur primary business is hotel-related, and our current hotel properties, the operation of which generates substantially all our Hospitality segment revenue, are concentrated in the group-oriented meetings sector of the hospitality industry. Therefore, a downturn in the lodging industry, in general, and the group-oriented meetings sector, in particular, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders.\nThe group-oriented meetings sector has suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic, and while we believe meeting planners will continue to rebook large group meetings to periods when a vaccine is widely available, there can be no assurance as to the timing and pace of our recovery.\nThe ability of Marriott to successfully operate and manage our current hotel properties and convention business is subject to factors beyond our and their control, which could reduce the revenue and operating income of these properties. These factors include:\n\u25cf the desirability and perceived attractiveness of the Nashville, Tennessee; Orlando, Florida; Dallas, Texas; Washington D.C. and Denver, Colorado areas as tourist and convention destinations;\n\u25cf adverse changes in the national economy and in the levels of tourism and convention business that affect our current hotel properties;\n\u25cf the level of governmental group business, which has decreased at times in the past due to uncertainty surrounding the U.S. government budget;\n\u25cf Marriott\u2019s ability to attract group convention business;\n\u25cf Marriott\u2019s ability to contract for and collect attrition and cancellation fees from groups that do not fulfill minimum stay or spending requirements;\n\u25cf the opening of other new hotels could impact the group convention business at our current hotel properties;\n\u25cf the highly competitive nature of the hotel, tourism and convention business in which our hotel properties operate, including the fact that we compete for convention business with publicly-financed civic convention centers;\n\u25cf the susceptibility of group convention business to reduced levels of demand during the year-end holiday periods, which Marriott may not be able to offset by attracting sufficient general tourism guests;\n\u25cf the financial condition of the airline and other transportation-related industries and the resulting impact on travel; and\n\u25cf increases in our operating costs due to labor costs in connection with any increases in the federal minimum wage rate, workers\u2019 compensation, healthcare-related costs (including those related to the Affordable Care Act or other health care reform efforts), and organized labor activities, the last of which, in addition to increasing labor costs, could cause a diversion of business from our hotels involved in labor negotiations and loss of group business.\nThese factors could reduce the revenues and net operating profits of our TRS lessees, which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders.\nDue to the geographic concentration of our current hotel properties, we are subject to a greater degree of risk to certain factors.\nDue to the geographic concentration of our current hotel properties, we are subject to a greater degree of risk to factors including:\n\u25cf local economic and competitive conditions;\n\u25cf natural and other disasters;\n\u25cf a decline in air passenger travel due to higher ticket costs or fears concerning air travel;\n\u25cf a decline in the attractiveness of the areas in which our hotels are located as a convention and tourism destination; and\n\u25cf a decrease in convention and meeting business at any of our properties.\nAny of these could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders.\nThe hotel business is capital-intensive, and our inability to obtain financing or successfully complete acquisitions or capital improvements, or the disruption associated with them, could limit our growth.\nAcquisitions of hotels will require significant capital expenditures, and hotels that we acquire may need renovations and capital improvements at the time of acquisition. All of our hotel properties will require periodic capital expenditures and renovation to remain competitive. We may also undertake hotel expansions or new features at our existing hotel properties that involve significant capital expenditures, such as our Gaylord Palms expansion. If any hotels that we acquire are subject to franchise agreements, the franchisors of these hotels may also require periodic capital improvements as a condition to our maintaining the franchise licenses. We may not be able to fund capital improvements or acquisitions solely from cash provided from our operating activities because we must distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for dividends paid and net of capital gains) each year to maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As a result, our ability to fund acquisitions or capital expenditures through any retained earnings or operating cash flow will be limited. Consequently, we will rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital to fund hotel acquisitions and improvements. Our ability to grow through acquisitions will be limited if we cannot obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing, which will depend on market conditions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing or that we will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms.\nIn addition, capital improvements may give rise to the following risks:\n\u25cf possible environmental problems;\n\u25cf construction cost overruns and delays;\n\u25cf the possibility that revenues will be reduced while rooms, restaurants or other facilities are out of service due to capital improvement projects;\n\u25cf a possible shortage of available cash to fund capital improvements and the related possibility that financing for these capital improvements may not be available to us on attractive terms; and\n\u25cf uncertainties as to market demand or a loss of market demand after capital improvements have begun.\nThe costs of renovations and capital improvements could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders.\nOur TRS lessee structure will subject us to the risk of increased hotel operating expenses and the inability of our TRS lessees to make lease payments to us.\nOur leases with our TRS lessees will require our TRS lessees to make lease payments to us based in part on gross revenues from our hotel properties. Our operating risks will include decreases in revenues at our hotel properties and increases in operating expenses of our hotel properties. Decreases in revenues or increases in operating expenses could adversely affect our TRS lessees\u2019 ability to make lease payments due under the leases, including, but not limited to, increases in wage and benefit costs, repair and maintenance expenses, property taxes, insurance costs, and other operating expenses. Increases in those operating expenses can have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock, and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders.\nIn addition, our TRS lessees\u2019 ability to make lease payments will be affected by factors beyond their control, such as changes in general economic conditions, the level of demand for hotels and the related services of our hotel properties, competition in the lodging and hospitality industry, the third-party managers\u2019 ability to maintain and increase gross revenue at our hotel properties and other factors relating to the operations of our hotel properties.\nWe and our third-party hotel manager rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption, or security failure could harm our business.\nWe and our third-party hotel manager rely on information technology systems, including networks and the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, personal identifying information, reservations, billing and operating data. Our businesses require collection of large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers in various information systems and those of our service providers. The integrity and protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to us. If that data is inaccurate or incomplete, we or the hotel managers could make faulty decisions. Customers and employees also have a high expectation that we and our third-party service providers and processors will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment surrounding information, security and privacy is also increasingly demanding and evolving. For example, in June 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective in January 2020, requiring companies that process information on California residents to, among other things, provide new disclosures and options to consumers about data collection, use and sharing policies. Our existing systems may be unable to satisfy changing regulatory requirements and employee and customer expectations, or may require significant additional investments or time to do so. Despite implementation of various measures designed to protect our information systems and records, including those we maintain with our service providers, we, the hotel managers and/or our third-party service providers may be subject to security breaches, system failures, viruses, operator error, unauthorized or inadvertent releases of data. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, employee, or company data maintained by us or by a service provider or failure to comply with the various U.S. and international laws and regulations applicable to the protection of such data, including the CCPA, or with Payment Card Industry (PCI) data security standards, could divert our attention, adversely impact our reputation, result in remedial and other fines or litigation, cause us to incur substantial liabilities or costs, result in a loss of valuable data, or a loss of consumer confidence. A breach in the security of our information systems or those of our service providers, or the unauthorized use of such data by us or our third-party providers, could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems, resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits.\nCyber security incidents could have a disruptive effect on our business.\nWhile we have implemented security measures to safeguard our systems and data, our measures or the measures of our service providers or hotel manager may not be sufficient to maintain the confidentiality, security, or availability of the data collected, stored, and used to manage our Gaylord Hotels properties. Efforts to hack or circumvent security measures, efforts to gain unauthorized access to data, failure of systems or software to operate as designed or intended,\nviruses, \u201cransomware\u201d or other malware, \u201cphishing\u201d or other types of business email compromises, operator error, or inadvertent releases of data may materially impact our information systems and records of those of our owners, licensees, or service providers. Our reliance on computer, Internet-based, and mobile systems and communications, and the frequency and sophistication of efforts by third parties to gain unauthorized access to such systems, have greatly increased in recent years. Like most large multinational corporations, our hotel manager and its service providers have experienced cyber-attacks, and attempts to disrupt access to their systems and data or those of properties our hotel manager manages and the frequency and sophistication of such efforts could continue to increase. Although some of these efforts may not be successful or impactful, a significant theft, loss, loss of access to, or fraudulent use of guest, associate, owner, licensee, or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses, fines, or litigation. Depending on the nature and scope of the event, compromises in the security of our information systems or those of our owners, licensees, or service providers or other disruptions in data services could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems or our hotel manager\u2019s systems, resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits, and negative publicity, resulting in tangible adverse effects on our business, including consumer boycotts, cancellations, lost sales or litigation, all of which could affect our market share, reputation, business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, although we or our manager carry cyber/privacy liability insurance that is designed to protect us against certain losses related to cyber risks, that insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in connection with cyber-attacks, security compromises, and other related incidents. Furthermore, in the future such insurance may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nOur real estate assets are subject to numerous risks.\nBecause we own hotels and attractions properties, we are subject to the risks that generally relate to investments in real property. The investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend in large part on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the related properties, as well as the expenses incurred. In addition, a variety of other factors affect income from properties and real estate values, including governmental regulations, insurance, zoning, tax and eminent domain laws, interest rate levels and the availability of financing. For example, new or existing real estate zoning or tax laws can make it more expensive and/or time-consuming to develop real property or expand, modify or renovate properties. When interest rates increase, the cost of acquiring, developing, expanding or renovating real property increases, particularly as the cost of borrowing increases, and real property values may decrease as the number of potential buyers decreases. Similarly, as financing becomes less available, it becomes more difficult both to acquire and to sell real property. Finally, governments can, under eminent domain laws, take real property. Sometimes this taking is for less compensation than the owner believes the property is worth. Any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, equity real estate investments, such as the investments we hold and any additional properties that we may acquire, are relatively difficult to sell quickly. If our properties do not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our income will be reduced.\nOur properties are subject to environmental regulations that could impose significant financial liability on us.\nEnvironmental laws, ordinances and regulations of various federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate certain of our properties and could make us liable for the costs of removing or cleaning up hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in the properties we currently own or operate or those we previously owned or operated. Those laws could impose liability without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to properly clean up such substances when present, could jeopardize our ability to develop, use, sell or rent the real property or to borrow using the real property as collateral. If we arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic wastes, we could be liable for the costs of removing or cleaning up wastes at the disposal or treatment facility, even if we never owned or operated that facility. Other laws, ordinances and regulations could require us to manage, abate or remove lead- or asbestos-containing materials. Similarly, the operation and closure of storage tanks are often regulated by federal, state, local and foreign laws. Finally, certain laws, ordinances and regulations, particularly those governing the management or preservation of wetlands, coastal zones and threatened or endangered species, could limit our ability to develop, use, sell or rent our real property. Existing governmental laws and regulations may be revised or new laws and regulations relating to climate change, air quality or other environmental and health concerns may be adopted or become applicable to us, which could\naffect the operations of our hotels and/or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions. The costs to clean up a contaminated property, to defend a claim, or to comply with environmental laws could be material and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Additionally, because we rely on third-party managers to operate our hotel properties and certain attractions, we have limited control over ensuring compliance at those locations with applicable environmental laws or regulations or approving certain remediation action taken by the manager to resolve such issues.\nCompliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act could require us to incur substantial costs.\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (the \u201cADA\u201d), all public accommodations must meet various federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with the ADA\u2019s requirements could require removal of access barriers, and non-compliance could result in the U.S. government imposing fines or in private litigants winning damages. Although we believe that our hotel properties substantially comply with present requirements of the ADA, we may be subject to audits or investigations of all of our hotels to determine our compliance, and one or more hotels may not be fully compliant with the ADA. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the incurrence of additional costs to attain compliance. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our hotel properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect. If we are required to make substantial modifications to our hotel properties, whether to comply with the ADA or other changes in governmental rules and regulations, our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and amount of cash available for debt service or distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected. Additionally, because we rely on third-party managers to operate our hotel properties and certain attractions, we have limited control over ensuring compliance at those locations with applicable ADA requirements or approving certain remediation action taken by the manager to resolve such issues.\nAs an owner of hotel properties and operator of leisure businesses, we are subject to risks relating to acts of God, outbreaks of pandemic disease, terrorist activity and war.\nOur operating income and ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be reduced by acts of God, outbreaks of pandemic disease, or acts of terrorism in locations where we own and/or operate significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of customers. Gaylord Opryland, which is located adjacent to the Cumberland River and is protected by levees built to sustain a 100-year flood, suffered flood damage on May 3, 2010 as the river rose to levels that over-topped the levees. The per occurrence flood insurance limit for our Gaylord Opryland hotel is now $350 million. We have also completed enhancements to the levees that protect the hotel to increase the height of the levees. While we believe these steps are reasonable given the likelihood of flood damage at Gaylord Opryland, there can be no assurances that flooding will not occur at Gaylord Opryland in the future. Some types of losses, such as from flood, earthquake, terrorism and environmental hazards, may be either uninsurable, subject to sublimit, or too expensive to justify insuring against. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a hotel, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel. In that event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. Similarly, outbreaks of pandemic disease, wars (including the potential for war), terrorist activity (including threats of terrorist activity), political unrest and other forms of civil strife as well as geopolitical uncertainty, may cause our future results to differ materially from anticipated results.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our hotel managers\u2019 employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels whose managers employ unionized labor, which could increase our hotels\u2019 operating costs, reduce the flexibility of our third-party hotel managers to adjust the size of the workforce at our hotel properties and impair our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nOur third-party hotel managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotel properties. Although we do not employ or manage employees at our hotel properties, we are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force, including at those of our hotels with unionized labor. From time to time, hotel operations may be disrupted as a result of strikes, lockouts, public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity. We also may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contract disputes or other events. The resolution of labor disputes or re-negotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs, either by increases in\nwages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs. Furthermore, labor agreements may limit the ability of our third-party hotel managers to reduce the size of hotel workforces during an economic downturn because collective bargaining agreements are negotiated between the third-party hotel managers and labor unions. We do not have the ability to control the outcome of these negotiations.\nAny failure to protect the trademarks and intellectual property used in our business could reduce the value of our brand names and harm our business.\nThird-party infringement of the Gaylord Hotels marks now owned by Marriott or the marks we own and use in our entertainment business, or the failure to enforce rights to the marks, could be damaging to our business.\nThe reputation and perception of the brands we use is critical to our success. If trademarks or intellectual property are misappropriated or used without authorization, the value of those brands, their reputation, our competitive advantages and our goodwill could be harmed. We regularly apply to register our trademarks in the United States. However, we cannot be certain that those trademark registrations will be granted or that the steps we take to protect our trademarks or intellectual property in the United States will be adequate to prevent others, including third parties or former employees, from copying or using our trademarks or intellectual property without authorization. Our intellectual property is also vulnerable to unauthorized use in some countries outside the United States, where local laws may not adequately protect it. Marriott owns and maintains the marks used in the Gaylord Hotels operations.\nMonitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. As we have in the past, we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could be costly, force us to divert our resources, lead to counterclaims or other claims against us, or otherwise harm our business. Any failure to maintain and protect trademarks and other intellectual property used in our business could reduce the value of our brands and harm our business.\nIlliquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our hotel properties and harm our financial condition.\nBecause real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more of our hotel properties in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions may be limited. The real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf adverse changes in international, national, regional and local economic and market conditions;\n\u25cf changes in interest rates and in the availability, cost and terms of debt financing;\n\u25cf changes in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances;\n\u25cf the ongoing need for capital improvements, particularly in older structures;\n\u25cf changes in operating expenses; and\n\u25cf civil unrest, acts of God, including earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters, which may result in uninsured losses, and acts of war or terrorism, including the consequences of the terrorist acts.\nWe may decide in the future to sell one or more of our hotel properties. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any hotel property for the price or on the terms set by us, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a hotel property. Further, as a REIT, we are subject to a 100% excise tax on net income derived from prohibited transactions, including the sale of property (other than foreclosure property) held primarily for\nsale to customers in the ordinary course. There can be no assurances that the IRS will not contend that the sale of a hotel is subject to this 100% excise tax.\nWe may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a hotel property can be sold. We cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements. In acquiring a hotel, we may agree to lock-out provisions that materially restrict us from selling that hotel for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that hotel. These factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our hotel properties could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, as well as the amount of cash available for distributions to our stockholders.\nOur operating results and ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected by various operating risks common to the lodging industry.\nOur hotel properties have different economic characteristics than many other real estate assets, and a hotel REIT is structured differently than many other types of REITs. A typical office property owner, for example, has long-term leases with third-party tenants, which provide a relatively stable long-term stream of revenue. Our TRS lessees, on the other hand, do not enter into a lease with a third-party hotel manager. Instead, our TRS lessees engage our third-party managers pursuant to hotel management agreements and pay the third-party hotel managers fees for managing our hotel properties. The TRS lessees receive all the operating profit or losses at our hotel properties, net of fees and reimbursements. Moreover, virtually all hotel guests stay at a hotel for only a few nights at a time, so the rate and occupancy at each of our hotel properties may change every day. As a result, we may have highly volatile earnings.\nIn addition, our hotel properties are subject to various operating risks common to the lodging industry, many of which are beyond our or a manager\u2019s control, including the following:\n\u25cf competition from other hotel properties and publicly-financed civic convention centers in our markets;\n\u25cf over-building of hotels in our markets, which could adversely affect occupancy and revenues at our hotel properties;\n\u25cf dependence on business and commercial travelers and tourism;\n\u25cf increases in energy costs and other expenses affecting travel, which may affect travel patterns and reduce the number of business and commercial travelers and tourists;\n\u25cf increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors that may not be offset by increased room rates;\n\u25cf changes in interest rates and in the availability, cost and terms of debt financing;\n\u25cf changes in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances;\n\u25cf adverse effects of international, national, regional and local economic and market conditions;\n\u25cf the impact of the use of Internet travel intermediaries by consumers;\n\u25cf unforeseen events beyond our control, such as terrorist attacks, travel-related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics (including a widespread outbreak of coronavirus in the United States), political instability, regional hostilities, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, travel-related accidents and unusual weather patterns, including natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes;\n\u25cf adverse effects of a downturn in the lodging industry; and\n\u25cf risks generally associated with the ownership of hotels and real estate.\nThese factors could reduce the net operating profits of our TRS lessees, which in turn could adversely affect the amount and frequency of distributions we make to our stockholders and our ability to service our debt.\nRisks Relating to Our Status as a REIT\nIf we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we would be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates and would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders when computing our taxable income.\nIf, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT, and are not entitled to relief under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d):\n\u25cf we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and\n\u25cf we would be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.\nAny such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes. This adverse impact could last for five or more years. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be taxable as a C corporation beginning in the year in which the failure occurs, and we would not be allowed to re-elect to be taxed as a REIT for the following four years.\nIf we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate certain assets to pay any additional tax liability. Accordingly, funds available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be reduced.\nREIT qualification involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code to our operations, as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. There are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions. Although we plan to operate in a manner consistent with the REIT qualification rules, we cannot assure you that we will so qualify or remain so qualified.\nAs a REIT, failure to make required distributions to our stockholders would subject us to federal and state corporate income tax.\nPrior to 2012, we had not paid a cash distribution on our common stock since 1999. Beginning in 2013 we declared, and we intend to continue to declare when appropriate, regular quarterly distributions, the amount of which will be determined, and will be subject to adjustment, by our board of directors. Our board of directors formerly maintained a dividend policy pursuant to which we paid a quarterly cash dividend in an amount equal to an annualized payment of at least 50% of adjusted funds from operations (as defined by us) less maintenance capital expenditures or 100% of REIT taxable income on an annual basis, whichever is greater. Our dividend policy may be altered at any time by our board of directors, and certain provisions of our debt agreements may prohibit us from paying dividends in accordance with the policy. In 2020, we suspended our regular quarterly dividend, but our dividends paid will satisfy the distribution requirement. To qualify as a REIT, we are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year to our stockholders. If our cash available for distribution falls short of our estimates, we may be unable to maintain the proposed quarterly distributions that approximate our taxable income and may fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT. In addition, our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal and state income tax purposes, or the effect of nondeductible expenditures.\nTo the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to federal and state corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the Code.\nEven though we are conducting our business as a REIT, certain of our business activities will be subject to corporate level income tax, which will continue to reduce our cash flows, and we will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities.\nEven though we are conducting our business as a REIT, we may be subject to certain federal, state, and local taxes on our income and assets, taxes on any undistributed income, and state or local income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. In addition, we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Code to maintain qualification for taxation as a REIT.\nOur business related to the non-real estate assets of our Hospitality segment and the assets of our Entertainment segment is conducted through wholly-owned TRSs because these activities could generate non-qualifying REIT income as historically structured and operated. Those TRS assets and operations continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located. Any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash. In addition, net operating losses in any of our TRSs generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for use against current or future taxable income in the TRSs.\nComplying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and increase the costs of our hedging, and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.\nThe REIT provisions of the Code limit our ability to hedge liabilities. Generally, income from hedging transactions that we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets and income from certain currency hedging transactions related to any non-U.S. operations do not constitute \u201cgross income\u201d for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRSs would be subject to tax on income or gains resulting from hedges entered into by them or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear.\nU.S. federal tax reform legislation could affect REITs generally, the geographic markets in which we operate, our stock and our results of operations, both positively and negatively in ways that are difficult to anticipate.\nIn 2017, the U.S. Congress passed tax reform legislation that made significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculations of taxes, as well as international tax rules for U.S. domestic corporations. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to this legislation. As a REIT, we are generally not required to pay federal taxes otherwise applicable to regular corporations (except for income related to our TRSs) if we comply with the various tax regulations governing REITs. Stockholders, however, are generally required to pay taxes on REIT dividends. Tax reform legislation will continue to affect the way in which dividends paid on shares of our common stock are taxed and could impact our stock price or how stockholders and potential investors view an investment in REITs generally.\nLegislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us or our stockholders.\nAt any time, the federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended. Federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS, the United States Department of the Treasury and state taxing authorities. Changes to the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect us. We cannot predict with certainty whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations applicable to us may be changed. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any such change will not significantly affect our ability to qualify for taxation as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences to us of such qualification.\nEven as a REIT, changes in federal, state, or local tax law, interpretations of existing tax law or agreements with tax authorities could affect our profitability and financial condition by increasing our tax costs.\nWe are subject to taxation at the federal, state and local levels in the United States. Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. From time to time, the U.S. federal, state and local governments make substantive changes to tax rules and the application thereof, which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law or interpretations and could adversely impact profitability. State and local tax authorities have increased their efforts to increase revenues through changes in tax law and audits. Such changes and proposals, if enacted, could increase our future effective income tax rates, as well as other taxes, including property taxes.\nThe ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT qualification, without stockholder approval, may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders.\nOur Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (\u201cCharter\u201d) provides that the board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate the REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to be a REIT, we will not be allowed a tax deduction with respect to distributions to our stockholders in computing our taxable income, and we will be subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate rates and state and local taxes, which may have adverse consequences on our stock price, distributions, and total return to our stockholders.\nWe may be required to borrow funds, sell assets, or issue equity to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements or maintain the asset ownership tests.\nTo meet the REIT distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a REIT, we may need to borrow funds, sell assets or issue equity, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, sales or offerings. Any insufficiency of our cash flows to cover our REIT distribution requirements could adversely impact our ability to raise short- and long-term debt, to sell assets, or to offer equity securities to fund distributions required to maintain our qualification and taxation as a REIT. Furthermore, the REIT distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives. This would increase our total leverage.\nIn addition, if we fail to comply with certain REIT asset ownership tests at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification. As a result, we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive assets. These actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.\nComplying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities.\nTo qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our common stock. Thus, compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities, and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. Furthermore, acquisition opportunities may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some REIT requirements prior to closing. In addition, as a REIT, we may face investor pressures to forego growth opportunities that are not immediately accretive.\nWe hold our non-qualifying REIT assets in one or more TRSs. These non-qualifying REIT assets consist primarily of non-real estate assets related to our Hospitality segment and the assets related to our Entertainment segment as historically structured and operated. We conduct a significant portion of our business activities through these TRSs. Under the Code, no more than 25% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs and other non-qualifying assets and no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by\nsecurities of one or more TRSs. These limitations may affect our ability to make additional investments in our Entertainment segment as historically structured and operated or in other non-REIT qualifying operations or assets. To meet our annual distribution requirements, we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations, including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt, and it is possible that we might be required to borrow funds, sell assets or issue equity to fund these distributions, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, sales or offerings.\nOur planned use of TRSs may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.\nThe net income of our TRSs is not required to be distributed to us, and income that is not distributed to us generally will not be subject to the REIT income distribution requirement. However, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our TRSs and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our TRSs could result in adverse tax treatment. In particular, if the accumulation of cash in our TRSs causes the fair market value of our securities in our TRSs and certain other non-qualifying assets to exceed 25% of the fair market value of our assets, we would fail to qualify as a REIT.\nIf our leases of our hotel properties to TRS lessees are not true leases for federal income tax purposes, we may fail to qualify as a REIT.\nIn order for the lease payments by our TRS lessees to our property-owning subsidiaries to qualify for purposes of the gross income tests, the lease or sublease must be considered a true lease for federal income tax purposes and must not be treated as a service contract, joint venture, or some other type of arrangement. We believe we have structured our leases and subleases of our hotel properties to our TRS lessees so that the leases will be considered true leases for federal income tax purposes, but there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with this characterization.\nIf Marriott or any future third-party hotel manager fails to qualify as an \u201celigible independent contractor,\u201d or if our hotels are not \u201cqualified lodging facilities,\u201d we may fail to qualify as a REIT.\nRent paid by a lessee or sublessee that is a \u201crelated party tenant\u201d of ours will not be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income tests applicable to REITs. An exception is provided, however, for leases of \u201cqualified lodging facilities\u201d to a TRS so long as the hotels are managed by an \u201celigible independent contractor\u201d and certain other requirements are satisfied. We lease or sublease our hotel properties to TRS lessees, and such TRS lessees have engaged Marriott as a third-party hotel manager. We believe Marriott and any other third-party hotel manager that our TRS lessees may engage in the future will qualify as \u201celigible independent contractors\u201d for federal income tax purposes. Among other requirements, to qualify as an \u201celigible independent contractor,\u201d the third-party hotel manager must not own, directly or through its stockholders, more than 35% of our outstanding shares, and no person or group of persons can own more than 35% of our outstanding shares and the shares (or ownership interest) of the third-party hotel manager, taking into account certain ownership attribution rules. The ownership attribution rules that apply for purposes of these 35% thresholds are complex, and monitoring actual and constructive ownership of our shares by the third-party hotel manager and their owners may not be practical. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that these ownership limits will not be exceeded.\nIn addition, for a third-party hotel manager to qualify as an \u201celigible independent contractor,\u201d such company or a related person must be actively engaged in the trade or business of operating \u201cqualified lodging facilities\u201d (as defined below) for one or more persons not related to the REIT or its TRSs at each time that such company enters into a hotel management contract with a TRS lessee. We believe that Marriott operates \u201cqualified lodging facilities\u201d for certain persons who are not related to us or our TRSs, and Marriott has agreed in the hotel management agreements that it, or its affiliates, are eligible independent contractors and will maintain such status. However, no assurances can be provided that Marriott or any other hotel managers that we may engage in the future will in fact comply with this requirement. Failure to comply with this requirement would require us to find other third-party hotel managers for future contracts, and, if we hired a third-party hotel manager without knowledge of the failure, it could jeopardize our status as a REIT.\nFinally, each property with respect to which our TRS lessees pay rent must be a \u201cqualified lodging facility.\u201d A \u201cqualified lodging facility\u201d is a hotel, motel or other establishment more than one-half of the dwelling units in which are used on a\ntransient basis, including customary amenities and facilities, provided that no wagering activities are conducted at or in connection with such facility by any person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers and who is legally authorized to engage in such business at or in connection with such facility. We believe that our current hotel properties are \u201cqualified lodging facilities.\u201d Although we intend to monitor future acquisitions and improvements of properties, REIT provisions of the Code provide only limited guidance for making determinations under the requirements for \u201cqualified lodging facilities,\u201d and there can be no assurance that these requirements will be satisfied.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Structure\nOur dividend is currently suspended, and covenants in our current and future debt instruments may limit our ability to make required distributions to our stockholders in accordance with our announced intended dividend policy.\nOur credit facility imposes, and future financing agreements are likely to impose, operating and financial restrictions on our activities, including restrictions on the payment of dividends. These restrictions are currently in place, and these restrictions currently permit only the payment of dividends as necessary to maintain our REIT status and payment of a dividend of $0.01 per share each quarter, and may prevent us from making distributions to our stockholders in accordance with any announced intended dividend policy. Our dividend was suspended in March 2020.\nOur cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.\nA REIT generally is required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders. Generally, our board of directors, in its sole discretion, will determine on a quarterly basis the amount of cash to be distributed to our stockholders based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments and plans for future acquisitions and divestitures. Our board of directors formerly maintained a dividend policy pursuant to which we paid a quarterly cash dividend based on an annualized amount of at least 50% of adjusted funds from operations (as defined by us) less maintenance capital expenditures or 100% of REIT taxable income on an annual basis, whichever is greater. As part of the actions taken to preserve liquidity in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, our board of directors suspended our regular quarterly dividend payments, and our board of directors will consider a future dividend as permitted by our credit agreement, which currently permits payment of dividends as necessary to maintain our REIT status and permits us to pay a dividend of $0.01 per share each quarter. The dividend policy may be altered at any time by our board of directors (as otherwise permitted by our credit agreement) and certain provisions of our agreements governing our other indebtedness may prohibit us from paying dividends in accordance with the prior policy. Consequently, our distribution levels may be minimal and may fluctuate.\nWe have invested in, and in the future may invest in, mortgage loans, mezzanine debt, joint ventures, such as our Gaylord Rockies and Circle investments, or certain minority equity interests over which we may not have significant control, to or for which we may owe significant funding or obligations and for which there is no readily available market, and these investments may not be profitable.\nWe may invest with third parties through partnerships, joint ventures or other entities, by acquiring non-controlling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. Further, we may invest in mortgage loans or mezzanine financing for a property. These types of investments may not be liquid and we may have little or no rights, or ability, to exercise the direction or control of the respective enterprises. In connection with these investments, we may have obligations under certain guarantees related to such investments. The ultimate value of any debt investments, joint ventures or minority investments will be dependent upon the efforts of others over an extended period of time. The nature of our interests and the absence of a readily available market for those interests restrict our ability to dispose of them. Our lack of control over the management of any business in which we are a creditor, joint owner or minority investor and the lack of a readily available market to sell our interest in these businesses may cause us to recognize a loss on our investment in these businesses or to incur costs or liabilities that we do not control, but for which we may be required to contribute capital or satisfy financial commitments. These arrangements are subject to uncertainties and risks, including those related to credit risk, conflicting joint venture partner\ninterests, including with respect to competition in other markets, and to our joint venture partners failing to meet their financial or other obligations.\nOur substantial debt could reduce our cash flow and limit our business activities.\nWe currently have a significant amount of debt. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $2.7 billion of total debt (which includes approximately $0.8 billion of debt related to our Gaylord Rockies joint venture, in which we own a 65% interest). We may incur additional debt in connection with any additional hotel acquisitions, development, investment in new projects, renovations, or capital improvement.\nOur substantial amount of debt could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to make distributions to our stockholders and to fund future capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate requirements;\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the hospitality industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with competitors that are less leveraged;\n\u25cf limit our ability to borrow additional funds, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity; and\n\u25cf limit our ability to obtain additional financing for various projects, including possible expansions of our existing properties and acquisitions of additional properties.\nIn addition, the terms of our credit facility allow, and instruments governing any new debt may allow, us to incur substantial amounts of additional debt subject to certain limitations. Any such additional debt could increase the risks associated with our substantial leverage. At the time any principal amount of our indebtedness is due, we may not have cash available to pay this amount, and we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe could be required to refinance our debt before it matures and there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance our debt on acceptable terms.\nOur ability to refinance each of our agreements governing our indebtedness on acceptable terms will be dependent upon a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our assets, borrowing restrictions which may be imposed by lenders and conditions in the credit markets at the time we refinance. In addition, although we have been successful in negotiating amendments to our credit agreement, which waive the financial covenants imposed by the credit agreement through March 31, 2022, and in negotiating an amendment to the Gaylord Rockies Loan, which provides for other favorable modifications, we may be unsuccessful in negotiating any further amendments or modifications to the agreements governing our indebtedness as we may deem necessary in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues or our business levels do not recover to pre-pandemic levels or we are otherwise unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we may be forced to choose from a number of unfavorable options, including agreeing to otherwise unfavorable financing terms, selling one or more hotel properties at unattractive prices or on disadvantageous terms, or defaulting on mortgages and allowing our lenders to foreclose. Any one of these options could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nTo service our debt and pay other obligations, we will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be available to us.\nOur ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, our debt, including our obligations under our senior notes and any future debt we may incur, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend largely upon our future operating\nperformance and our ability to generate cash from operations. Our future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, including pace of economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt and other obligations will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants and financial ratios in our senior credit facility and our other debt agreements, including other agreements we may enter into in the future. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or we may not have future borrowings available to us under our credit facility or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nThe agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that may limit our ability to operate our business and impair our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nOur existing financial agreements, including our credit facility and term loan B impose, and future financing agreements are likely to impose, operating and financial restrictions on our activities, including our ability to make distributions to any stockholder. Our credit facility has required and in the future will require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios, including minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, minimum implied debt service coverage ratio and maximum funded debt to asset value ratio, and we expect will require us to comply with these tests in the future (subject to the covenant waiver described in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Our financial agreements prohibit or limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf incur additional debt, issue guarantees of debt and issue preferred stock;\n\u25cf create liens;\n\u25cf sell assets;\n\u25cf sell equity interests in our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u25cf redeem and/or prepay certain debt;\n\u25cf pay dividends on our stock to our stockholders or repurchase our stock or other equity interests;\n\u25cf make certain investments;\n\u25cf enter new lines of business;\n\u25cf engage in consolidations, mergers and acquisitions;\n\u25cf enter into transactions with affiliates; or\n\u25cf agree to restrictions on our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to us.\nIf we fail to comply with these covenants, we would be in default under our credit facility and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes, and the outstanding principal and accrued interest on such debt would become due and payable.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, could affect our ability to comply with these covenants and maintain applicable financial tests and ratios. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity for the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt, including, in the case of our existing credit facility, our four wholly-owned Gaylord Hotels properties. Under these circumstances, we might\nnot have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing and to make distributions to our stockholders in accordance with any dividend policy.\nOur indebtedness is secured by a substantial portion of our assets.\nSubject to applicable laws and certain agreed-upon exceptions, our $700 million revolving credit facility, $300 million term loan A, and $500 million term loan B are secured by liens on the substantial majority of our assets, including mortgages on each of our four wholly-owned Gaylord Hotels properties. In addition, the Gaylord Rockies joint venture\u2019s $800 million term loan is secured by liens on the substantial majority of Gaylord Rockies assets. In the event of a default under our credit facility, or if we experience insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the holders of our secured debt instruments would first be entitled to payment from their collateral security, and only then would holders of our unsecured debt be entitled to payment from our remaining assets.\nWe are a holding company and depend upon our subsidiaries\u2019 cash flow to meet our debt service obligations.\nWe are a holding company and we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, including our TRSs. As a result, our ability to meet our debt service obligations substantially depends upon our subsidiaries\u2019 cash flows and payments of funds to us by our subsidiaries as dividends, loans, advances, leases or other payments. The payment of dividends and/or making of loans, advances, leases or other payments by our subsidiaries will be subject to the approval of those subsidiaries\u2019 boards. Our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay such dividends and/or make such loans, advances, leases or other payments may also be restricted by, among other things, applicable laws and regulations, current and future debt agreements and management agreements into which our subsidiaries may enter.\nAny replacement of LIBOR as the basis on which interest on our variable-rate debt is calculated may harm our financial results, profitability and cash flows.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $1.6 billion of variable interest rate debt that was indexed to the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). The United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced on July 27, 2017 that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR quotations after 2021 (the \u201cFCA Announcement\u201d). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be assured after 2021, and LIBOR may cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for use as a benchmark. Recent proposals for LIBOR reforms may result in the establishment of new methods for calculating LIBOR or the establishment of one or more alternative benchmark rates. Although the agreements governing our indebtedness provide for successor base rates, as applicable, the successor base rates may be related to LIBOR, and the consequences of any potential cessation, modification or other reform of LIBOR cannot be predicted at this time. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to amend the agreements governing our indebtedness, and we cannot predict what alternative interest rate(s) will be negotiated with our counterparties. As a result, our interest expense may increase, our ability to refinance some or all of our existing indebtedness and/or interest rate swaps may be impacted and our available cash flow may be adversely affected.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to make cash distributions to stockholders at intended payment levels, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations to make distributions to our stockholders at any time in the future.\nAs a REIT, we will generally be required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gains) each year for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, which requirement we currently intend to satisfy, and we must distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income, including capital gains, to eliminate federal corporate income tax liability. To the extent we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income.\nSubject to maintaining our REIT qualification, we intend to make regular quarterly distributions to our stockholders, but no assurances can be made as to the amount of distributions in the future. We have also announced our intention to make distributions at specified minimum levels. Our board of directors may alter our dividend policy at any time and will have the sole discretion to determine the timing, form and amount of any distributions to our stockholders. Among the factors that could impair our ability to make distributions to our stockholders are:\n\u25cf our inability to invest our available cash;\n\u25cf our inability to realize attractive risk-adjusted returns on our investments;\n\u25cf unanticipated expenses that reduce our cash flow or non-cash earnings;\n\u25cf defaults in our investment portfolio or decreases in the value of the underlying assets; and\n\u25cf the fact that anticipated operating expense levels may not prove accurate, as actual results may vary from estimates.\nAs a result, no assurance can be given that the level of any distributions we make to our stockholders in the future will achieve a market yield or increase or even be maintained over time, any of which could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, distributions that we make to our stockholders will generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary income and will generally not be eligible for reduced rates applicable to \u201cqualified\u201d dividend income. However, a portion of our distributions may be designated by us as long-term capital gains to the extent that they are attributable to capital gains income recognized by us or may constitute a return of capital to the extent that they exceed our earnings and profits as determined for tax purposes. A return of capital is not taxable, but has the effect of reducing the basis of a stockholder\u2019s investment in our common stock.\nOur organizational documents and Delaware law could make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of us.\nOur Charter and our Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of our company or our management. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions:\n\u25cf impose restrictions on transfer and ownership of our common stock that are designed to assist us in maintaining our status as a REIT;\n\u25cf authorize us to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which is preferred stock that can be created and issued by our board of directors, without stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of common stock;\n\u25cf establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at meetings;\n\u25cf provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called only by our chairman or by a majority of the members of our board of directors;\n\u25cf prohibit stockholder actions taken on written consent; and\n\u25cf impose restrictions on ownership of common stock by certain persons (including non-United States persons) due to our ownership of a radio station.\nWe are subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could also delay or prevent a change of control. Together, our Charter, Amended and Restated Bylaws, and Delaware law may discourage transactions that otherwise\ncould provide for the payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock, and also could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of our common stock and discourage a takeover.\nOur Charter permits our board of directors to issue up to 100 million shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders. As of the date hereof, we have no shares of preferred stock outstanding. Our board of directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any new series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. In the event that we issue shares of preferred stock in the future that have preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders may impede a takeover of us and prevent a transaction favorable to our stockholders.\nThe ownership limitations in our Charter may restrict or prevent stockholders from engaging in certain transfers of our common stock.\nTo qualify and remain qualified as a REIT, no more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include various kinds of entities) during the last half of any taxable year. To assist us in qualifying as a REIT, our Charter contains a share ownership limit. Generally, any of our shares owned by affiliated owners will be added together for purposes of the share ownership limit. This share ownership limit provides that (subject to certain exceptions) no person may beneficially own, or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, more than 9.8%, in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of our capital stock, or any class or series of our capital stock. If anyone transfers shares in a manner that would violate the share ownership limit or prevent us from qualifying as a REIT, those shares instead will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and will be either redeemed by us or sold to a person whose ownership of the shares will not violate the share ownership limit or we will consider the transfer to be null and void from the outset, and the intended transferee of those shares will be deemed never to have owned the shares.\nOur Charter also prohibits the ownership of shares by any person or entity if such ownership would violate or otherwise be inconsistent with federal communications laws or regulations pertaining to the ownership of television or radio stations, cable television or other radio authorizations by (i) foreign persons or entities, (ii) persons or entities having interests in television or radio broadcast stations, newspapers or cable television systems, and (iii) entities seeking direct or indirect control of us without prior federal regulatory approval. In the event of a transfer that would result in a violation or inconsistency with federal communications laws or regulations we may refuse to permit the transfer, suspend the rights of share ownership as necessary to prohibit the violation or inconsistency, or redeem the shares. Anyone who acquires shares in violation of the share ownership limit or the other restrictions on transfer in our Charter bears the risk of suffering a financial loss when the shares are redeemed or sold if the market price of our shares falls between the date of purchase and the date of redemption or sale. In addition, these ownership limitations may prevent an acquisition of control of us by a third party without the approval of our board of directors, even if our stockholders believe the change of control is in their interest.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are subject to risks related to our environmental, social and governance practices.\nMany factors influence our reputation including the perception held by our customers and other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business, and the perception held by customers of Marriott or any future third-party hotel manager. The lodging and entertainment industries in which we operate face increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance activities and risk of damage to our reputation if we fail to act responsibly or comply with regulatory requirements in a number of areas, such as safety and security, environmental stewardship and\nsustainability, climate change, diversity, human rights, philanthropy and support for local communities. The continuing evolution of social media presents new challenges and requires us to keep pace with new developments and trends. Negative posts or comments about us, the properties we own and Marriott or any future third-party hotel manager on any social networking or user-generated review website, including travel and vacation property websites, could affect consumer opinions of us, and we cannot guarantee that we will timely or adequately redress such instances.\nHospitality companies have been the target of class actions and other lawsuits alleging violations of federal and state law and other claims, and we may be subject to legal claims.\nOur operating income and profits may be reduced by legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of our employees, customers or other third parties. In recent years, a number of hospitality companies have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination, customer privacy breaches and other alleged violations of law. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. Similar lawsuits have been instituted against us from time to time and were resolved in an immaterial manner, but we cannot assure you that we will not incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from future lawsuits of this type or other claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, because we rely on third-party managers to operate our hotel properties and certain attractions, we have limited control over defending lawsuits of this type or other claims.\nHealth care reform efforts could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state governments have considered and enacted legislation and regulations intended to effect major change within the U.S. healthcare system, including changes intended to increase access to health insurance. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d), is the most prominent of these reform efforts. The Affordable Care Act affects how health care services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms. It includes a requirement, known as the \u201cemployer mandate,\u201d that large employers make health insurance coverage available to employees or pay a penalty. However, the Affordable Care Act has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges and may be subject to additional efforts to repeal or make additional significant changes to the law, its implementation and/or its interpretation. For example, effective in January 2019, the penalty associated with the individual mandate to maintain health insurance was repealed. As a result of this change, a federal judge in Texas ruled in December 2018 that the entire Affordable Care Act was unconstitutional. This decision was appealed, and in November 2020, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding the case. The law remains in effect pending the appeals process. We anticipate that Congress and state governments will continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose or adopt legislation, regulations and policies resulting in additional fundamental changes in the health care system. For example, some members of Congress have suggested expanding the coverage of government-funded insurance programs, including single-payor models (such reforms are often referred to as \u201cMedicare for All\u201d).\nAt this time, pursuant to our management agreements, our third-party managers may pass certain health care costs for employees working at our properties through to us. As such, the provisions of the Affordable Care Act as currently in effect, as modified, or subsequent reform efforts, may significantly raise our and our third-party managers\u2019 employee health benefits costs and/or alter the benefits we or our third-party managers are required to provide to our respective employees. If we or our third-party hotel managers are not able to limit or offset future cost increases, those costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. As a result, government efforts to repeal or change the Affordable Care Act or implement other reform initiatives may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity.\nThe ability of our board of directors to change our major policies without the consent of stockholders may not be in our stockholders\u2019 interest.\nOur board of directors determines our major policies, including any policies and guidelines we may maintain from time to time relating to our acquisitions, leverage, financing, growth, qualification as a REIT and distributions to our\nstockholders. Our board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies and guidelines from time to time without the vote or consent of our stockholders. Accordingly, our stockholders will have limited control over changes in our policies and those changes could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock may vary substantially based on changes in market interest rates and other factors.\nThe trading prices of equity securities issued by REITs have historically been affected by changes in market interest rates and other factors. One of the factors that may influence the market price of our common stock is the annual yield from distributions on our common stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments. An increase in market interest rates, or a decrease in our distributions to stockholders, may lead prospective purchasers of our shares to demand a higher annual yield and choose other investments, which could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nOther factors that could affect the market price of our common stock include the following:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations of companies in the hotel or real estate industries;\n\u25cf changes in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts;\n\u25cf fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes;\n\u25cf issuances of common stock or other securities in the future;\n\u25cf disputes with our hotel managers;\n\u25cf the addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances; and\n\u25cf unforeseen events beyond our control, such as terrorist attacks, travel related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics (including a widespread outbreak of coronavirus in the United States), political instability, regional hostilities, increases in fuel prices, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, travel related accidents and unusual weather patterns, including natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tsunamis or earthquakes.", "PERMNO": 85426, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "RHP"}
