{"cik": "278041", "company": "INTERNATIONAL SHIPHOLDING CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-03", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nThe following discussion of \u201crisk factors\u201d identifies the most significant risks or uncertainties that could (i) materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects or (ii) cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations. You should carefully consider these factors, in addition to the other information set forth in this report, when evaluating our business and whether to purchase, sell or hold our securities. Please note that the following discussion is not intended to comprehensively list all risks or uncertainties faced by us. Our operations or actual results could also be similarly impacted by additional risks and uncertainties that (i) are not currently known to us, (ii) we currently deem to be immaterial or (iii) are not specific to us or our industry, such as the impact of general economic conditions or natural disasters.\nOur industry has experienced a recent sharp decline in the demand for certain of the services we offer, which has negatively impacted our revenues and earnings.\nHistorically, the shipping industry has been cyclical. The nature, timing and degree of changes to industry conditions are generally unpredictable and are impacted by factors beyond our control. Various factors influence the demand for our transportation services, including changes in (i) worldwide demand for the commercial products we carry, (ii) the volume of cargoes we carry for or the amount of services we provide to the U.S. government, (iii) the supply and demand for vessels, (iv) political and regulatory conditions domestically and internationally, (v) the proximities of regions producing and consuming cargoes, and (vi) seaborne and alternative transportation patterns, including the distance cargo is transported by sea and the impact of military or civil disturbances. The worldwide supply of vessels generally increases with deliveries of new, refurbished or converted vessels and decreases with the scrapping of older vessels. If the available supply of vessels exceeds the demand for ship transportation services, competition in the markets where we operate will likely increase and the time charter hire and cargo rates for our vessels will likely decrease, resulting in, among other things, lower operating revenues, earnings and asset values.\nCurrently we face highly competitive and challenging market conditions. In many markets, the available supply of vessels exceeds market demands for such vessels. Time charter hire and cargo rates are currently at depressed levels in a large number of markets. Certain indices used as benchmarks to monitor the movement of cargoes, such as the Baltic Dry Index, have reached all-time lows within the past few months. These conditions have adversely impacted the maritime transportation industry in several respects, including lower vessel values, reduced financing options, reduced secondhand markets for used vessels, increased demands for freight rate reductions and widespread loan covenant defaults by shipping companies. As a result of these developments, several shipping companies have announced reductions in their capital expenditure or fleet expansion plans, and some have sought bankruptcy protection. We currently believe these market conditions will continue to impact our operating revenues, earnings and asset values (regardless of whether we successfully implement our Strategic Plan), which will continue to place pressure on the market value of our capital stock.\nOur operating results for any particular period can vary significantly based on the amount of supplemental cargoes we carry during that period, which is completely outside of our control. During periods of relatively low supplemental cargoes, such as the past couple of years, our operating results are adversely affected. Due to the inherent variability of these supplemental cargoes, we cannot predict the revenues or profits attributable to any supplemental cargo that we may carry for any particular future period.\nWe have incurred significant net losses the past two years, which, coupled with other factors, raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur net losses were $179.7 million and $54.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Based on current conditions, we expect to incur additional losses in 2016 (excluding potential gains on the sale of assets). These losses have substantially reduced our liquidity. This reduction in liquidity, coupled with other factors discussed in this report, caused us to reflect all of our outstanding indebtedness as current liabilities beginning September 30, 2015. As noted in the other risk factor disclosures below, we have recently been unsuccessful in raising new cash, and have sought to address our liquidity needs principally through the sale of assets.\nAs described in greater detail elsewhere herein, our continuing viability is dependent upon our ability to fully execute our Strategic Plan and to improve our operating results in 2016. As a result of uncertainties regarding these matters, including our lenders\u2019 abilities to demand payment under our debt agreements and our limited refinancing prospects, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This uncertainty may negatively impact the trading price of our outstanding securities and make it more difficult or impossible for us to obtain financing or renew commercial arrangements. If our operations were to cease, you may suffer a complete loss of your investment in our securities.\nOur substantial indebtedness and lease commitments has adversely affected our financial condition and impaired our ability to operate and invest in our business.\nWe are a highly leveraged company and, as a result, have significant debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2015, we had $156.8 million of aggregate indebtedness outstanding (net of deferred debt issuance costs), all of which is currently classified as\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncurrent liabilities. In addition to the liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, we owe substantial amounts under our long-term operating leases. For additional information on our indebtedness and commitments, please see Items 7 and 8 of this report.\nOur leverage could have material adverse consequences to our company, including:\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and other expenses or investments planned by us;\n\u00b7\nincreasing the risk that we will need or, as is currently the case, be required by our lenders to (i) sell securities or assets (to the extent permitted by our loan covenants), possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations or (ii) forego paying dividends to our preferred and common stockholders;\n\u00b7\nincreasing the risk that we may not meet the financial covenants contained in our current or future debt agreements, or timely make all required debt payments due thereunder (either of which could result in an event of default thereunder);\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to satisfy our other contractual obligations or commitments;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility and our ability to capitalize on business opportunities, and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in our business or industry;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations in other areas of our business, including for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, stock repurchases and other general business activities, because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service our debt;\n\u00b7\nincreasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business, an increase in prevailing interest rates and other adverse economic or industry conditions generally;\n\u00b7\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to those of our less leveraged competitors;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability, or increasing the costs, to refinance our indebtedness; and\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to enter into hedging transactions by reducing the number of counter-parties with whom we can enter into such transactions as well as the volume of those transactions.\nNotwithstanding our leverage, we believe that we will be required to continue to incur capital expenditures to maintain, upgrade and modernize our fleet. As discussed further below, we must continue to periodically incur drydock expenses to maintain our ability to operate our vessels. Moreover, we believe we will need to replace several of our aging vessels, particularly those in our Jones Act fleet. We cannot assure you that our cash will be sufficient to properly maintain, upgrade and modernize our fleet.\nAs described further in this report, our ability to meet our debt obligations, lease commitments and other expenses will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nSubject to market conditions, we may periodically seek additional borrowings either to refinance some or all of our debt or for other purposes, such as purchasing vessels or businesses or funding uninsured losses or liabilities. Due to the current state of the credit markets and shipping industry, we may not be able to refinance maturing debt at terms that are as favorable as those from which we previously benefited, at terms that are acceptable to us or at all. For all the reasons referred to under \u201c- The current state of global financial markets and current economic and industry conditions have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our ability to obtain additional financing,\u201d you should not assume that we will be able to obtain additional financing. If we are able to obtain additional financing, our credit may be adversely affected and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our then outstanding indebtedness could be adversely affected. For additional information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Item 7 of this report.\nBecause of our substantial indebtedness, we have in the past had to obtain default waivers or amendments pertaining to various of the covenants included in our credit facilities in order to avoid or cure non-compliance or default thereunder, and we may in the future have to seek similar waivers under our credit facilities. There is a risk that such waivers may be costly or may not be granted at all and our ability to satisfy our obligations could consequently be adversely affected. For additional information, see \u201c- We cannot assure that we will be able to comply with all of our loan covenants.\u201d\nIf we cannot service our current or future indebtedness or otherwise comply with the covenants in our credit facilities, we could be forced to sell additional assets, modify our current business plans or strategies (including our Strategic Plan), reduce or delay capital expenditures, reduce or eliminate distributions, enter into financings of our unencumbered vessels, restructure or refinance existing debt, delay or refrain from making contractually required payments, curtail certain of our operations, seek additional equity capital,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nseek bankruptcy protection or liquidate our operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement any of these potential actions in a timely manner or at all. Some or all of these actions could further reduce or eliminate the value of our outstanding common and preferred stock.\nWe cannot assure that we will be able to comply with all of our loan covenants.\nAll of our credit agreements and several of our lease agreements impose restrictions or limitations on our business and require us to comply with various loan covenants. The restrictions or limitations these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to freely: (i) consolidate or merge; (ii) incur new or certain types of debt; (iii) engage in transactions with affiliates; (iv) create liens or permit them to exist on our assets; (v) sell certain assets; (vi) enter into sales and leaseback transactions; (vii) directly invest in assets other than vessels and (viii) pay dividends on our capital stock. These covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that otherwise might be considered beneficial to us and our stockholders.\nIn addition, all of our credit agreements and several of our lease agreements include financial covenants that stipulate (i) minimum levels of net worth, working capital, liquidity and expense coverage and (ii) maximum levels of debt and debt leverage. Our ability to satisfy these and other covenants depends on a wide range of factors, including our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions. Our ability to respond to such changes may be beyond our control or may be significantly restricted by contractual or other limitations.\nAs noted in greater detail elsewhere in this report, since early 2014 we have struggled to meet some or all of our required financial covenants. Consequently, we solicited and received from our lenders and lessors amendments to or default waivers from various of these covenants to assure our compliance therewith on multiple occasions over the past couple of years, beginning as of March 31, 2014. As discussed elsewhere in this report, we received most recently (i) waivers to temporarily cure covenant defaults at September 30, 2015, (ii) a series of comprehensive covenant default waivers on or about November 16, 2015, and (iii) a series of additional covenant default waivers since then to address, among other things, our failure to comply with various requirements included in our contractual arrangements with our lenders and lessors. As discussed elsewhere in this report (including the risk factor immediately below), we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of our financial or other loan covenants in the future.\nFailure to satisfy any of the financial covenants in any of our financing agreements could cause us to suffer an event of default, which could, among other things, accelerate our obligations under such agreement or preclude us from making future borrowings thereunder. Moreover, because our debt obligations are represented by separate agreements with different lenders and lessors, in some cases any breach of these covenants or any other default under one agreement may create an event of default under other agreements, resulting in the acceleration of our obligation to pay principal, interest and potential penalties under such other agreements (even though we may otherwise be in compliance with our obligations under those agreements). Thus, an event of default under a single agreement, including one that is technical in nature or otherwise not material, could result in the acceleration of significant indebtedness under multiple lending agreements. If amounts outstanding under such agreements were to be accelerated, under current circumstances it is unlikely that we would be able to obtain additional sources of cash to repay the accelerated indebtedness (either under our current financing arrangements or new ones) and it is likely that one or more of our lenders would proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness.\nIf we default under our credit agreements or certain of our principal lease agreements, we would face a number of potentially adverse consequences, including our potential inability to continue as a going concern, all of which are described elsewhere herein in further detail, including in the risk factors immediately above and below.\nFor further detailed information on our lack of compliance with our financial covenants, please see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Item 7 of this report.\nOur failure to successfully implement the remainder of our Strategic Plan could materially adversely harm us.\nAs explained in greater detail elsewhere in this report, we do not believe we will be able to service our required obligations or meet the financial covenants contained in our principal financing agreements unless we successfully implement a range of actions contemplated under our Strategic Plan, as well as possible transactions outside of the Strategic Plan, including locating one or more purchasers willing to pay fair value for a large number of our non-core assets by various specified dates in the first half of 2016. Although we have already completed several planned asset sales, we still need to complete several other sales or negotiate alternative transactions in order to meet our objectives under the plan, all of which will need to comply with our contractual arrangements with our lenders and lessors. With respect to these future transactions, we cannot assure you that we will locate purchasers for all or any of the assets that we have committed to sell under our recent credit facility amendments, nor can we assure you that such purchasers will be willing to pay the minimum prices required by our creditors or to purchase our assets by the dates required by our lenders, particularly in light of the depressed state of the shipping industry. There may be other impediments to our ability to sell assets, including (i) the need to obtain corporate or regulatory approvals, (ii) the receipt of required consents from various other third parties, such as our customers, lessors or lenders, and (iii) actual or threatened litigation, including potential challenges that the sales are void\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nunder fraudulent transfer, insolvency or other laws that seek to protect the interests of creditors. Moreover, other elements of our Strategic Plan are dependent upon various negotiations or cost-cutting initiatives, the success of which is partly or wholly outside of our control. For all these reasons, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement our Strategic Plan, or to comply with the requirements imposed by our lenders and lessors in our credit facility amendments entered into since mid-November 2016. For additional information, see Note F - Debt Obligations to our consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this report. If we fail to implement our Strategic Plan or comply with our recent credit facility amendments, or if for any other reason we fail to pay our debts as they become due or to meet our credit facility covenants (whether for reasons within our control or outside of our control), our lenders and lessors would have the right to accelerate our debt, to demand payment and to proceed against the collateral securing that debt. Any such event, if not successfully mitigated, would substantially increase the likelihood of us curtailing some or all of our operations, seeking bankruptcy protection or liquidating our operations.\nIf we successfully implement our Strategic Plan or take other steps to reduce our indebtedness, the profile of our operating assets will be materially different.\nPrior to adopting our Strategic Plan on October 21, 2015, we operated six separate segments. In addition to selling the vessels and contracts operated by our Dry Bulk Carriers segment, we plan to sell, or have already sold, various other assets, including (i) our minority equity interests in entities operating mini-bulkers, chemical tankers and asphalt tankers, (ii) one of our international-flagged PCTCs, (iii) one of our Jones Act tug/barge units, (iv) our rail car repair facilities near the port of Mobile, Alabama and (v) certain brokerage contracts. In connection with our attempt to strengthen our financial position and liquidity, we may seek to sell other assets, either on our own initiative or at the request of our creditors. Assuming these initiatives are successful, we will own fewer income-generating assets operating in a smaller, less diversified set of markets. Although we believe that the successful implementation of these initiatives will better position us to discharge our obligations, given the unpredictability of our ongoing negotiations with our lenders, lessors and potential vessel purchasers, we cannot assure you which operations will remain. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our remaining operations will be profitable or viable.\nThe market value of our vessels has decreased, and may decrease further in the future.\nThe fair market value of each of our vessels is dependent upon a variety of factors, including:\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and market conditions affecting the marine transportation industry, including the demand for cargoes, the demand for vessels and the availability of vessel financing;\n\u00b7\nprevailing levels of time charter and voyage rates;\n\u00b7\nthe number of comparable vessels in the world fleet;\n\u00b7\nthe types and sizes of comparable vessels available;\n\u00b7\nthe specific age and attributes of the vessel;\n\u00b7\nchanges in trading patterns or trading routes that affect demand for particular sizes and types of comparable vessels;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of vessels under construction and scrap prices;\n\u00b7\nchanges in regulation or competition from other shipping companies and other modes of transportation; and\n\u00b7\ntechnological advances in vessel design and propulsion.\nAs a result of the decline of prevailing freight rates and demand for our vessels and services, among other factors, the fair market value of our vessels has declined in recent periods. The fair market value of our vessels may decline further in the future.\nDeclines in the market values of our vessels can result in asset impairment charges, covenant defaults and various other adverse consequences.\nThe above-referenced decline in the fair market value of our vessels will limit the amount of proceeds we can reasonably expect to receive in connection with implementing our plans to sell vessels to simplify our operations and reduce our indebtedness. If the proceeds from our sale of certain specified vessels are below certain specified amounts, we will breach certain commitments we have made to our lenders in late 2015, which could, in the absence of waivers, lead to events of default under our financing agreements. The decline in asset values also limits the collateral value of vessels we have pledged as security to our lenders, which could reduce their willingness to extend more credit or restructure their existing loans. Lower asset values of our unencumbered vessels will also limit the amount of funds we could potentially raise by offering those vessels as loan collateral.\nFalling asset prices can also result in impairment charges. Given current weaknesses in our business and industry, we have elected to test our vessels for impairment on a quarterly basis. We may incur additional non-cash impairment charges in connection with (i) further implementation of our Strategic Plan, (ii) amendments to our Strategic Plan or future determinations to market or sell other\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nassets not currently included within the scope of our Strategic Plan or (iii) further declines in our business or the maritime transportation industry in general. In 2015 and 2014, we recognized impairment losses of $154.4 million and $38.2 million, respectively. For additional information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies - Long-Lived Assets.\u201d\nUnder certain conditions, declines in the value of our assets or our incurrence of impairment charges can cause us to fail to comply with covenants in our financing agreements. Although we currently have in place temporary covenant default waivers that address prior covenant defaults resulting from lower asset values, we cannot assure you that future declines in our asset values will not give rise to future covenant defaults or that our lenders or lessors will be willing to provide relief in connection with such defaults. Covenant defaults could result in the consequences described under \u201c- We cannot assure that we will be able to comply with all of our loan covenants.\u201d\nThe sale of our assets could result in other losses or liabilities.\nDepending on a wide variety of factors, the sale of substantial portions of our assets, either in connection with our Strategic Plan or otherwise, could cause us to incur withdrawal liabilities under our multi-employer pension plans. These liabilities, if incurred, could be substantial.\nMoreover, if we sell any assets for prices below our carrying value for the asset, we will incur losses that will be required to be reported on our consolidated statements of income under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These losses could, among other things, limit our ability to raise capital or comply with the above-referenced covenants contained in our financing agreements.\nOur capital stock is no longer listed on a major stock exchange, which may adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of our capital stock.\nIn late December 2015, each class of our outstanding common and preferred stock ceased to qualify for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d). Subsequently, each such class has commenced trading on the OTCQX market (\u201cOTCQX\u201d), an inter-dealer quotation service maintained by OTC Markets Group Inc. for over-the-counter securities. Stocks traded on the OTCQX market generally have lower trading volumes, fewer market makers, higher trading volatility and wider spreads between bid and ask quotations than stocks traded on national exchanges. A significant number of institutional investors have investment policies that prohibit them from trading in OTCQX securities. Similarly, many brokers may be restricted from recommending OTCQX securities to their customers due to their firm\u2019s trading policies or applicable regulations of self-regulatory agencies. As a result, investors may find it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations of the price of, our securities. This significantly limits the liquidity of our capital stock, and may adversely affect demand for and the market price of our capital stock. Moreover, the OTCQX market is much less regulated than the major exchanges, which could lead to a greater incidence of trading abuses. For all these reasons, our securities should be purchased or held only by investors who are willing and able to assume these risks and who can hold our securities for an indefinite period of time.\nA limited trading market may also impair our ability to (i) raise capital by selling shares of capital stock, (ii) acquire other companies or assets by using our capital stock as consideration, (iii) attract coverage from analysts, and (iv) use equity-based compensation to incentivize our key personnel.\nWe do not now, and are not expected to in the foreseeable future, meet the listing standards of the NYSE or any other national securities exchange. The listing of our securities on the OTCQX could be suspended or terminated if we fail to attain certain requirements for continued qualification. As such, we cannot assure you that our capital stock will continue to trade on the OTCQX. Any failure of our capital stock to continue to qualify for OTCQX trading could further limit the liquidity and trading value of our securities.\nWe currently owe cumulative dividends with respect to our preferred stock, which precludes us from paying dividends with respect to our common stock and has certain other potential or actual adverse consequences.\nOur 9.50% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock and 9.00% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock accrue dividends that are payable on January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30 of each year, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors. We paid all accrued dividends with respect to our preferred stock through July 30, 2015, but deferred payment of dividends accrued on such stock that were payable on October 30, 2015 and January 30, 2016 as certain of our November 2015 credit facility amendments prohibit us from paying preferred stock dividends unless various financial conditions are met.\nOur failure to pay dividends on October 30, 2015 and January 30, 2016 has increased the dividend rate accruing on our preferred stock. Under the terms of each of our series of preferred stock, our failure to pay dividends on such shares on any two dividend payment dates (whether consecutive or not) results in the per annum dividend rate increasing by an additional 2.00% per $100.00 stated liquidation preference, or $2.00 per annum, up to a maximum annual dividend rate of twice the original interest rate,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncommencing on and after the day following such second dividend payment date. Consequently, the dividend rate accruing on both of our series of outstanding preferred stock increased, effective January 31, 2016, and will continue to increase if we fail to make upcoming quarterly preferred dividend payments. The dividend rate will reset to the original dividend rate if and when we have paid all accrued and unpaid dividends for three consecutive quarters.\nIf we do not pay dividends in full on either series of our preferred stock for six or more quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, then the holders of our outstanding preferred stock will be entitled to elect two additional directors to serve, during the period of such payment arrearage, on our board of directors, subject to various specified terms, conditions and limitations specified in our charter.\nMoreover, as noted in the next risk factor, our failure to pay dividends with respect to our preferred stock precludes us from paying dividends with respect to our common stock.\nWe are currently restricted from paying dividends with respect to our common stock.\nAs noted above, we currently owe cumulative dividends with respect to our preferred stock. No cash dividends may be declared or paid on any of our common stock unless full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are paid on all of our outstanding shares of preferred stock through the most recent respective dividend payment dates. In addition, the terms of our charter governing our preferred stock prohibit us from paying any common stock dividends unless we attain specified net worth ratio, and at least one of our credit facilities prohibits the payment of any common stock dividends unless we have at least $30.0 million of liquidity after making such payment. Consequently, we will be unable to pay cash dividends with respect to our common stock unless (i) we have paid all accrued and unpaid dividends with respect to our preferred stock through the most recent respective dividend payment dates, (ii) we are in compliance with the above-described net worth ratio governing our preferred stock and (iii) we meet the requirements for paying dividends under our credit facilities.\nThere are various other reasons why we may not be willing or able to make quarterly dividends on, or any other payments in respect of, our outstanding capital stock, either on a timely basis or at all.\nAs noted in the immediately preceding risk factor, we currently owe cumulative dividends with respect to our preferred stock and are precluded from paying dividends with respect to our common stock. Even if we are willing and able to pay the full amount of cumulative dividends that have accrued on our shares of preferred stock, we cannot assure you, for the other reasons noted below, that we will pay dividends on, or make other payments in respect of, our capital stock.\nBecause we are a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends will depend on the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries and their ability to furnish funds to us in the form of dividends, loans or other payments.\nAny quarterly dividends on our common stock and our Series A and Series B Preferred Shares may be paid from funds legally available for such purpose when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors. You should be aware that certain factors may influence our decision, or adversely affect our ability, to pay dividends on our common stock or our Series A and Series B Preferred Shares, including, among other things:\n\u00b7\nour supply of cash or other liquid assets might be insufficient for any of the reasons described in this report, including (i) due to net losses from our operations or changes in competition, regulation, vessel rates, fleet deployment, taxes, capital markets, operating or drydock costs, or litigation expense or (ii) the impact of any liquidity shortfalls caused by the below-described restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to lawfully transfer cash to us;\n\u00b7\nany of the events described in this report that impact our future financial position or performance, including changes in vessel deployment or vessel rates, changes in our costs, the number of unscheduled off-hire days for our fleet, the number of days required for dry-docking of our vessels, prevailing global and regional economic and political conditions, and the effect of governmental regulations and maritime self-regulatory organization standards on the conduct of our business;\n\u00b7\nour ability to service and refinance our current and future indebtedness and our ability to borrow or raise additional capital to satisfy our capital needs;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions imposed by our existing or future credit facilities, operating leases, debt securities, preferred stock securities (including those referred to above), or other agreements, including restricted payment and leverage covenants;\n\u00b7\nour cash requirements or plans might change for a wide variety of reasons, including changes in our debt payment plans, capital allocation plans (including a desire to retain or accumulate cash), capital spending plans, stock purchase plans, acquisition strategies, strategic initiatives, pension funding requirements or plans, or financial position;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of cash that our subsidiaries may make available to us, whether by dividends, loans or other payments, may be subject to (i) restrictions imposed by the law of the respective jurisdictions of organization of such subsidiaries and (ii)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrestrictions imposed pursuant to existing or future credit facilities, debt or equity securities, leases, or other agreements applicable to such subsidiaries; and\n\u00b7\nlimitations on cash payments to stockholders under Delaware law, including limitations that require dividend payments be made out of surplus or, subject to certain limitations, out of net profits for the then-current or preceding year in the event there is no surplus.\nBased on its evaluation of these and other relevant factors at any particular future date, our Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, decide not to declare a dividend on our common stock or our Series A or B Preferred Shares for any quarterly period for any reason, regardless of whether at such time we have funds legally available for such purposes and are permitted to do so under applicable contract or charter restrictions. Holders of our equity securities should be aware that they have no contractual or other legal right to receive dividends.\nThe current state of global financial markets and current economic and industry conditions have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our ability to obtain additional financing.\nDuring the second half of 2014, we attempted to raise cash to recapitalize our debt and operating leases through the issuance of debt securities or borrowings from financial institutions, but ultimately abandoned these efforts in light of challenging conditions in the capital markets generally and for maritime transportation companies specifically. Subject to market conditions, we may in the future re-attempt to access the capital markets to raise cash, either to refinance some or all of our debt or for other purposes. Our ability to arrange any such financing could be limited by, among other factors, (i) our financial position and performance, (ii) restrictions on financing transactions imposed under our financing, lease, charter or other commercial agreements, (iii) our relative lack of unencumbered assets that we can offer as collateral to creditors and (iv) prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Global financial markets continue to be volatile, particularly with respect to underperforming industries such as ours. Prevailing market conditions could be adversely affected by (i) general economic conditions, such as disruptions in domestic or overseas sovereign debt markets, geo-political instabilities, contractions or limited growth in the economy or other similar adverse economic developments in the U.S. or abroad, and (ii) specific conditions in the maritime transportation industry, such as the continuation of vessel over-capacity, depressed freight rates and low vessel values. Volatility in the global markets, among other factors, could continue to limit our access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or our inability to obtain financing on terms that are as favorable as those from which we previously benefitted, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Any such failure to obtain additional financing could jeopardize our ability to repay, refinance or reduce our debt obligations.\nEconomic conditions, a prolonged economic downturn, economic uncertainty, an increase in trade protectionism or a change in trade patterns in the markets where we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe demand for our transportation services has been and will continue to be affected by domestic and global economic conditions. Worldwide economic growth has been sluggish since 2008, which has contributed to lower charter rates for marine transportation services since then. Many experts believe that a confluence of worldwide factors could result in a prolonged period of economic downturn, slow growth or economic uncertainty. If these conditions persist, our customers and potential customers may experience deterioration in their business, which may result in a lower demand for our transportation services or impair the ability of our customers or other third parties to pay amounts owed to us. Moreover, our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to pay dividends and future prospects will likely be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged economic downturn impacting our markets.\nThe demand for our transportation services is also exposed to the risk that increases in trade protectionism or changes in trade patterns will adversely affect our business. If global economic conditions remain slack and uncertain, governments may turn to trade barriers to protect their domestic industries against foreign imports, thereby depressing the demand for shipping. Similarly, if changes in production costs or other factors cause manufacturing companies to locate a greater share of their production facilities nearer to their consumers, then demand for our shipping services could be further depressed. Either of these could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, ability to pay dividends and future prospects.\nChanges in economic policy could similarly reduce the demand for shipping services. For instance, the government of China recently implemented economic policies designed to increase domestic consumption of Chinese-made products. Demand for our services could be adversely affected if China or other countries implement these or similar types of policies.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nA significant amount of our revenues are derived from four customers, and our revenues could decrease significantly if these customers were lost or their revenues decreased.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenue from contracts with various agencies or departments of the U.S. government and from our top three commercial customers. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we derived the following portion of our revenues from our contracts with the following top customers:\nWe are unable to assure you that these customers will continue to contract with us on similar terms, or will not decide to contract with our competitors or perform their own shipping functions themselves. Our inability or failure to continue to retain these customer relationships, to continue to employ our vessels at rates comparable to those historically earned from these customers, or to charter these vessels otherwise in a reasonable period of time or at all could adversely affect our operations and performance.\nOur reliance on revenue from the U.S. Government subjects us to the risks of reduced governmental funding and spending.\nWe derive revenues from the federal government in exchange for (i) transporting various cargoes, including military equipment and food aid, and (ii) providing access to certain of our vessels under military readiness programs. Amounts spent by the federal government for these services are subject to the federal government\u2019s budgetary and legislative processes. In the recent past, certain payments to us by the federal government have been reduced in connection with Congressional budget cuts, and we could experience similar cuts in the future. Moreover, the volume of governmental cargoes is volatile and influenced by a wide variety of factors, including the level of U.S. military activity overseas. Currently pending government proposals could reduce the level of food shipped by the federal government, thereby decreasing demand for our services. For all these reasons, there can be no assurance that the federal government will authorize or spend any particular amount of funds on transportation services or military readiness programs for any specified period.\nIn addition, the federal government can unilaterally cancel our federal contracts at any time without cause and without penalty to the government, subject to, in most cases, our contractual right to receive certain early termination fees. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the federal government will not cancel any federal government contracts that have been or will be awarded to us. In addition, under certain circumstances, the federal government can suspend or terminate our eligibility to provide additional future services to the federal government. Any of these developments could materially adversely affect our business, operations, revenues and profits.\nWe depend on our ability to qualify as an eligible bidder under contract criteria and to compete successfully against other qualified bidders in order to obtain certain of our contracts.\nThe U.S. government and certain of our customers conduct rigorous competitive processes for awarding certain contracts pursued by us. We typically face strong competition and pricing pressures for competitively bid contract awards, and we may be required to qualify or continue to qualify under applicable contract criteria. Our inability to qualify as an eligible bidder under government contract criteria could preclude us from competing for certain contract awards. In addition, our inability to qualify as an eligible bidder, or to compete successfully when bidding for certain contracts and to win those contracts, could materially adversely affect our business, operations, revenues and profits.\nWe may not be able to renew our time charters and contracts when they expire at favorable rates or at all.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we received approximately 73% of our revenue from time charters and other fixed contracts. However, there can be no assurance that any of these charters or contracts, which are generally for periods of one year or more, will be renewed.\nMoreover, you should be aware that shipping rates are based on several factors that are unpredictable and beyond our control. Accordingly, even if we are able to renew our charters or other fixed contracts when they lapse, we may not be able to earn rates or carry volumes comparable to those received under the expired charters or contracts, which would adversely affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows. From time to time over the past year, we have been unable to renew our shipping contracts without agreeing to rate decreases, and we expect this may continue to be the case with respect to certain upcoming contract renewals in light of currently prevailing low freight rates.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn the event we cannot deploy a vessel at economically viable rates, we may opt to lay up the vessel until such time that spot or charter rates become attractive again. During the period of lay-up, the vessel will continue to incur expenditures such as insurance and maintenance costs.\nIf our exposure to the spot market increases, our revenues could suffer and our expenses could increase.\nAt December 31, 2015, we derived approximately 27% of our revenue from the spot market, where rates are typically volatile and subject to short-term market fluctuations. The spot market for marine transportation services is highly competitive, and, as noted above, charter rates for most dry cargo vessels in the spot market are currently at or near historical lows. If we deploy a greater percentage of our vessels in the spot market, we may experience a lower overall utilization of our fleet through waiting time or ballast voyages, leading to a decline in our operating revenue and gross profit and an increased risk that we will be unable to recoup our investment in those vessels.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe shipping industry is intensely competitive and can be influenced by economic and political events that are largely outside the control of shipping companies. In each of our principal markets, we face competition from a wide variety of marine transportation companies that operate a diverse group of vessels. In addition, our Rail-Ferry and Jones Act operations face current or potential competition from land-based transportation companies.\nMany of our current and potential competitors may:\n\u00b7\nhave greater resources or stronger brands than we have;\n\u00b7\nown larger and more diverse fleets of vessels;\n\u00b7\nbe less leveraged than us;\n\u00b7\nconduct operations or raise capital at lower costs than us; or\n\u00b7\nbe better positioned to adapt to changes in market or economic conditions.\nChanges in the political or regulatory environment can also create competition that is not necessarily based on normal considerations of profit and loss. Consequently, there can be no assurance that we will be able to deploy our vessels on economically attractive terms, maintain attractive freight rates, pass cost increases through to our customers or otherwise successfully compete against our competitors. Any failure to remain competitive in the shipping industry could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nCompetition could adversely impact us in several ways, including (i) the loss of customers and market share, (ii) the possibility of customers reducing their usage of our vessels or services, (iii) our need to expend substantial time or money on vessel acquisitions or capital improvement projects, (iv) our need to lower prices or increase marketing expenses to remain competitive, (v) our need to sell vessels to cover our fixed commitments, and (vi) our inability to diversify by successfully offering new marine transportation services.\nOlder vessels have higher operating and capital costs and are potentially less desirable to charterers.\nThe average age of the vessels in our fleet that we own or lease, excluding our vessels engaged in U.S. coastwise trade, is approximately fourteen years. The average age of our vessels actively engaged in U.S. coastwise trade is approximately thirty-four years (which reflects the longer vessel lives typically associated with vessels deployed in this trade). See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview\u201d in Item 7 of this report. In general, capital expenditures and other costs necessary for maintaining and insuring a vessel in good operating condition increase and become more difficult to estimate with accuracy as the age of the vessel increases. Moreover, customers generally prefer modern vessels over older vessels, which places the older vessels at a competitive disadvantage, especially in weak markets. In addition, changes in governmental regulations, compliance with classification society standards and customer requirements or competition may require us to make additional expenditures for alterations or the addition of new equipment. In order to make such alterations or add such equipment, we may be required to take our vessels out of service, thereby reducing our revenues. Expenditures such as these may also require us to incur additional debt or raise additional capital. There can be no assurance that market or general economic conditions will enable us to replace our existing vessels with new vessels, justify the expenditures necessary to maintain our older vessels in good operating condition or enable us to operate our older vessels profitably during the remainder of their estimated useful lives.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMarine transportation is inherently risky, and insurance may be insufficient to cover losses that may occur to our assets or result from our operations.\nThe operations of our vessels are subject to various inherent risks, including:\n\u00b7\ncatastrophic marine disaster;\n\u00b7\nadverse weather conditions or natural disasters;\n\u00b7\nmechanical failure or equipment damage;\n\u00b7\ncollisions;\n\u00b7\nhazardous substance spills;\n\u00b7\nseizure or expropriation of our vessels by governments, pirates, combatants or others; and\n\u00b7\nnavigation and human errors.\nThe occurrence of any of these events may result in, among other things, death or injury to persons, damage to or loss of our vessels and our vessels\u2019 cargo or other property, delays in delivery of cargo, damage to other vessels and the environment, loss of revenues, termination of vessel charters or other contracts, fines, penalties or other restrictions on conducting business, damage to our reputation and customer relationships, and injury to personnel. Such occurrences may also result in a significant increase in our operating costs or liability to third parties.\nAlthough we maintain insurance coverage against most of these risks at levels our management considers to be customary in the industry, risks may arise for which we are not adequately insured. Various claims, such as claims for business interruption, may not be covered by our policies. Additionally, any particular claim may be subject to deductibles or other coverage restrictions, the aggregate impact of which could be material. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renew our existing insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or that insurance will remain available at reasonable rates for each of our foreseeable risks that we seek to insure, especially those relating to terrorism, war or piracy. Similarly, we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims as they arise, or that available insurance will cover all foreseeable risks, particularly those involving catastrophic environmental liability. Any uninsured or underinsured loss could have an adverse effect on our financial performance or condition.\nAdditionally, certain of our insurance coverage is maintained through mutual \u201cprotection and indemnity\u201d associations, which are mutual insurance clubs whose members must contribute payments to cover losses sustained by other club members. As a member of such associations, we routinely pay premiums to fund liability reserves, and may be required to make additional payments to the extent member claims would surpass the reserves of the association. We may be subject to calls or premiums in amounts based not only on our own claim records, but also the claim records of all other members (or the members of affiliated clubs) over which we have no control. Our payment of these calls could result in significant additional expenses. In addition, we cannot assure you that other association members called upon to pay our claims will be able to do so, particularly since the exposure to such calls would be concentrated among a limited number of shipping companies, many or most of which are facing the same types of risks and current industry challenges as ours.\nNegative publicity may adversely impact us.\nAccidents involving any vessels operated by us could cause substantial adverse publicity affecting us specifically or our industry generally. In either case, media coverage and public statements that insinuate improper actions by us, regardless of their factual accuracy or truthfulness, may result in negative publicity, litigation, governmental investigations or additional regulations. Addressing negative publicity and any resulting litigation or investigations may distract management, increase costs and divert resources. Negative publicity may have an adverse impact on our reputation and the morale of our employees, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur participation in the U.S. Government\u2019s Maritime Security Program subjects us to certain operational risks.\nThroughout 2015, we had eight contracts to participate in the Maritime Security Program (\u201cMSP\u201d), which included four of our PCTCs, two container vessels, and two multi-purpose heavy lift dry cargo vessels. In exchange for receiving fixed annual cash payments, we have committed under this program to providing capacity in our participating vessels for the movement of military cargoes upon the request of the U.S. Secretary of Defense in time of war or national emergency. If any of our participating vessels are called upon to provide such emergency military service in the future, we could be adversely affected if, among other things, such service interferes with our commercial shipping operations, reduces our aggregate revenues or endangers our vessels or their crews. As noted above under \u201c- Our reliance on revenue from the U.S. government subjects us to the risks of reduced government funding,\u201d we cannot assure you that Congress will continue funding the MSP, at current levels or at all.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur business would be adversely affected if we failed to comply with the Jones Act, or if this law was modified or repealed.\nA substantial portion of our shipping operations are conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade. Under U.S. federal laws known as the \u201cJones Act,\u201d this trade is restricted to vessels built in the United States, owned and manned by U.S. citizens and registered under U.S. Flag. Our failure to comply with these restrictions could subject us to severe penalties, including the permanent loss of the right to engage in U.S. coastwise trade. If the Jones Act were repealed, substantially amended or waived, it could potentially result in additional competition from vessels built in generally lower-cost foreign shipyards and owned and manned by foreign nationals, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. From time to time, advocates of new or expanded free trade agreements have proposed changes to the Jones Act, and other interest groups have lobbied Congress to repeal the Jones Act to facilitate enhanced competition in the U.S. coastwise trade. Although these efforts have not succeeded to date, we cannot assure you that the Jones Act will not be repealed or modified in the future in a way that would be detrimental to our business.\nUnder certain conditions, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security can grant waivers of the Jones Act to foreign vessel operators. Thus far, the Secretary has granted waivers only for relatively short periods in connection with natural disasters and the transportation of petroleum released from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Nonetheless, future waivers, particularly if for longer periods, could result in increased competition, which could negatively impact our Jones Act operations.\nTerrorist attacks, piracy and international hostilities can affect the transportation industry, which could adversely affect our business.\nTerrorist attacks or piracy attacks against merchant ships, the outbreak of war, or the existence of international hostilities could adversely affect us in several ways, including:\n\u00b7\ndamaging the world economy;\n\u00b7\nadversely affecting the availability of and demand for transportation services generally, or our vessels in particular;\n\u00b7\nincreasing the cost of insurance;\n\u00b7\ndisrupting our vessel usage or deployment; and\n\u00b7\nadversely affecting the value of our vessels or our ability to profitably operate our vessels and serve our customers.\nMerchant ships remain subject to piracy attacks, particularly in the Gulf of Aden and off the East Coast of Africa. Our industry is a sector of the economy that we believe is particularly likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability, terrorist attacks, war, international hostilities or piracy. In addition, we conduct operations in Indonesia, Southern Mexico, West Africa, the Arabian Gulf, and other areas that are particularly likely to be exposed to the risk of these potential adverse events.\nWorld events could adversely affect our business\nContinuing conflicts and recent developments in the Middle East, North Africa and Ukraine, and the presence of U.S. and other armed forces in the Middle East, may lead to additional acts of terrorism or armed conflict around the world. Disputes over certain islands and reefs in the East China Sea and South China Sea have created tensions among several Asian and other nations. These conditions may contribute to further economic instability in the global financial markets. These uncertainties could also adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. In the past, political conflicts have also from time to time resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region. Any of these or similar occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nAs a holding company with no operations of our own, we rely on payments from our operating companies to meet our obligations.\nAs a holding company without any material assets or operations, substantially all of our income and operating cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of funds by those subsidiaries to us in the form of dividends, loans or other payments. As a result, we rely upon our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations, including the payment of amounts owed under our long-term debt, or to declare and make dividend payments to the holders of our securities. The ability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to allow us and them to make scheduled payments on our respective obligations will depend on their future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. Additionally, our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts owed by us, or, subject to limited exceptions for tax-sharing purposes, to make any funds available to us to repay our debt or other obligations, whether by dividends, loans or other payments. The law of the jurisdiction of organization applicable to each of our subsidiaries may restrict the amount of dividends that they may pay. Restrictions imposed by credit agreements or leases applicable to certain of our subsidiaries may limit the amount of funds that our subsidiaries are permitted to transfer to us, including the amount of dividends that may be paid to us. In addition, our rights to receive assets of any subsidiary\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nupon its liquidation or reorganization will also be effectively subordinated to the claims of creditors of that subsidiary, including trade creditors.\nIf we incur a change of control, we will be in default under certain of our debt agreements, which could have various adverse ramifications.\nMost of our debt agreements provide that it will be an event of default if we incur a change of control (as defined in such agreements, which we have publicly filed with the SEC). Unless the lender waives any such default or we pay the debt then owed under the applicable debt agreement, we would default under such debt agreement, which could in turn constitute a default under other of our debt agreements outstanding at that time. We may be unable or unwilling to cure any such event of default, either due to lack of cash, legal or contractual impediments, or otherwise, and we cannot assure you that our lenders would be willing to waive any such events of default or to restructure our debt. Moreover, the existence of these event of default provisions may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us, or the removal of our incumbent directors.\nWe are subject to certain risks with respect to our counterparties on contracts, and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause us to suffer losses or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nThe ability and willingness of our counterparties to perform their obligations under their contracts with us will depend upon a number of factors that are beyond our control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions and the overall financial condition of these counterparties, especially in light of the current global financial weakness. If the charter rates payable under our contracts substantially exceed current rates, charterers may seek to renegotiate the previously-agreed upon rates or take other steps designed to attain rate reductions. If our counterparties fail to honor their obligations under their agreements with us, we could sustain significant losses or a reduction in our vessel usage, either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business and operations are highly regulated, which can adversely affect our operations.\nOur business and the shipping industry in general are subject to increasingly stringent local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations governing, among other things, the health and safety of our employees, and the staffing, construction, operation, insurance and transfer of our vessels. Many aspects of our operations are subject to regulation by a wide array of agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the United Nation\u2019s International Maritime Organization, as well as various foreign agencies that regulate our operations under their respective jurisdictions. Compliance with or the enforcement of applicable laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. For example, in the event of war or national emergency, our U.S. Flag vessels are subject to requisition by the U.S. government. Although we would be entitled to compensation in the event of a requisition of our vessels, the amount and timing of such payments would be uncertain and there would be no guarantee that such amounts would be paid, or if paid, would fully satisfy lost profits associated with the requisition. In addition, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions or, in certain cases, the suspension or termination of our operations.\nIn addition, we are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain, maintain and periodically renew certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our operations. In certain instances, the failure to obtain, maintain or renew these authorizations could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may also be required to periodically modify operating procedures or alter or introduce new equipment for our existing vessels to appropriately respond to changes in governmental regulation, safety or equipment standards, or our customer\u2019s needs. If the costs associated with these changes are material, they could adversely affect our financial condition or financial performance.\nOur business and the operation of our vessels are subject to extensive international, national and local environmental, health and safety laws in the jurisdictions in which our vessels operate, as well as in the country or countries of their registration. In recent years, the International Maritime Organization, the European Union and other governmental or quasi-governmental bodies have proposed or adopted measures designed to, among other things, reduce the sulfur content of maritime fuel and the amount of maritime carbon dioxide and other air emissions, and to manage ballast water and address invasive species concerns. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in penalties, sanctions or, in certain cases, the ultimate suspension or termination of our operations.\nInternational, national and local laws that impose liability for oil spills or other ship-generated pollution have become more stringent over the past couple decades and may continue to become more stringent in the future. Some impose joint, several, and in some cases, unlimited liability on owners, operators and charterers regardless of fault. We could be held liable as an owner, operator or charterer under these laws. In addition, under certain circumstances, we could also be held accountable under these laws for acts or omissions of our affiliates, our charterers or other parties in connection with the management or operation of our vessels. Liability for a catastrophic\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nspill could exceed the insurance coverage we have available, and result in our having to liquidate assets to pay claims. In addition, we may be required to contribute to funds established by regulatory authorities for the remediation of oil pollution damage or to provide financial assurances for oil spill liability to regulatory authorities.\nThe profitability and viability of certain of our customers\u2019 businesses are dependent upon laws and regulations governing their operations. Laws that restrict or preclude their operations could reduce demand for certain vessels.\nWe may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change.\nIncreased concern about the potential impact of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide resulting from combustion of fossil fuels, on climate change has resulted in efforts to regulate their emission. Legislation, international protocols, regulation or other restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions could increase our compliance costs and could also affect our customers. In particular, currently-pending U.S. governmental proposals to reduce carbon emissions could reduce the demand for our coal-carrying vessels deployed in our Jones Act operations. Additionally, in our normal course of operations, we use a significant amount of fossil fuels. The costs of controlling our greenhouse gas emissions or obtaining required emissions allowances in response to any regulatory change in our industry could increase materially.\nIncreased security and inspection procedures and tighter import and export controls could increase costs and disrupt our business.\nInternational maritime shipping is subject to various security and customs inspections and related procedures in countries of origin and destination. For instance, various government agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, including the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, have adopted several rules, policies or regulations, including regulations that require us to operate certain of our vessels and facilities pursuant to both applicable maritime security regulations and approved security plans. Applicable inspection procedures can result in the seizure of contents of our vessels, delays in delivering cargoes, and the levying of customs payments, duties, fines and other penalties against us. Under certain circumstances, our failure to comply with these regulations could restrict our ability to operate certain of our vessels or facilities.\nThe U.S. government, foreign governments, international organizations, and industry associations have from time to time considered ways to expand inspection procedures. Such changes, if implemented, could impose additional financial and legal obligations on us, including additional responsibility for physically inspecting the contents of cargoes we are shipping. Furthermore, changes to inspection procedures could also impose additional costs and obligations on our customers and may, in certain cases, render the shipment of certain types of cargo impractical. Any such changes or developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur failure to pass inspection by classification societies and regulators could result in one or more of our vessels being unemployable unless and until they pass inspection, resulting in a loss of revenues from such vessels for that period.\nThe hull and machinery of every commercial vessel must be classed by an international classification society authorized by its country of registry, as well as being subject to survey and inspection by shipping regulatory bodies. The international classification society certifies that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and the United Nations Safety of Life at Sea Convention.\nDue to the age of several of our vessels, the repairs and remediations required in connection with classification society surveys and inspections may be extensive and require significant expenditures. Additionally, if any of our vessels fails to pass such a survey or inspection or is required to be repaired or remediated as a result of any such survey or inspection, the vessel may be unable to trade between ports and, therefore, would be unemployable. Any such loss of the use of a vessel could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations, and any such impact may be material.\nWe face periodic drydocking costs for our vessels, which can be substantial.\nVessels must be drydocked periodically for regulatory compliance and for maintenance and repair. Our drydocking requirements are subject to associated risks, including delay and cost overruns, lack of necessary equipment, unforeseen engineering problems, employee strikes or other work stoppages, unanticipated cost increases, inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals and shortages of materials or skilled labor. A significant delay in completing scheduled drydockings could have an adverse effect on our contract commitments. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty and can be substantial. Our insurance does not cover these costs.\nWe are subject to the risk of price volatility on the fuel we consume in connection with certain of our operations.\nAlthough our customers are responsible for fuel costs with respect to a substantial portion of our operations, we have some exposure to fuel price risks under various of our other operations. Due to the competitive nature of these other operations, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset fuel price volatility. Although we currently have some fuel surcharges in place, a material\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nchange in current fuel prices that are not covered by these fuel surcharges could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks associated with operating internationally.\nOur international operations are subject to U.S. and other laws and regulations regarding operations in foreign jurisdictions. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include anti-corruption laws, anti-competition laws, anti-boycott laws, tax laws, immigration laws, privacy laws and accounting requirements. Local laws and regulations, and their interpretation and enforcement, differ significantly among those jurisdictions, and can change significantly over time with little or no warning. There is a risk that these laws or regulations may be breached through inadvertence or mistake, fraudulent or negligent behavior of our employees or agents, failure to comply with certain formal documentation or technical requirements, or otherwise. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us or our personnel, or prohibitions on the conduct of our business or our ability to operate in one or more countries, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition to these international regulatory risks, some of the other risks inherent in conducting business internationally include:\n\u00b7\ntax, licensing, political or other business restrictions or requirements;\n\u00b7\neconomic, political and social instability, with the attendant risks of extortion or civil unrest;\n\u00b7\npotential vessel seizure, terrorist attacks, piracy, kidnapping, the expropriation of assets and other governmental actions, many of which are not covered by our insurance;\n\u00b7\ncurrency and repatriation restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7\npotential submission of disputes to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel;\n\u00b7\npandemics or epidemics that disrupt worldwide trade or the movement of vessels;\n\u00b7\nlonger payment cycles and problems collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7\nuncertainties concerning import and export restrictions, including the risk of fines or penalties assessed for violations;\n\u00b7\nembargoes or other restrictive governmental actions that could limit our ability to operate in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nadditional U.S. and other regulation of non-domestic operations, including regulation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) as well as other anti-corruption laws;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to enforce our contract rights, either due to under-developed legal systems or government actions that result in a deprivation of contract rights;\n\u00b7\nlimitations in the availability, amount or terms of insurance coverage;\n\u00b7\nlaws, policies or practices that restrict with whom we can contract or otherwise limit the scope of operations that can legally or practicably be conducted within any particular country;\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of unanticipated or increased taxes, increased environmental and safety regulations or other forms of public or governmental regulation that increase our operating expenses; and\n\u00b7\nchallenges in staffing and managing foreign operations, including logistical and communications challenges.\nMany of these risks are beyond our control, and we cannot predict the nature or the likelihood of the occurrence or corresponding effect of any such events, each of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, in order to effectively compete in certain foreign jurisdictions, it is frequently necessary or required to establish joint ventures, strategic alliances or vessel revenue sharing agreements with other shipping companies or local operators, partners or agents. In certain instances, these local operators, partners or agents may have interests that are not always aligned with ours. Reliance on local operators, partners or agents could expose us to the risk of being unable to control the scope or quality of our overseas services or products, or being held liable under the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws for actions taken by our strategic or local partners or agents even though these partners or agents may not themselves be subject to the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation or prospects.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur vessels could be seized by maritime claimants, which could result in a significant loss of earnings and cash flow for the related off-hire period.\nUnder general maritime law in many jurisdictions, crew members, vessel mortgagees, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against a vessel for unsatisfied debts or claims for damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lienholder may enforce its lien by either arresting or attaching a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of our vessels could result in a significant loss of earnings and cash flow during the detainment period.\nIn some jurisdictions, under the extended \u201csister ship\u201d theory of liability, a claimant may arrest not only the vessel with respect to which the claimant\u2019s maritime lien has arisen, but also any associated vessel under common ownership or control. Consequently, a claim may be asserted against us or any of our subsidiaries or our vessels for the liability of one or more of the other vessels we own. While we have insurance coverage for these types of claims, we cannot guarantee it will cover all of our potential exposure.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain skilled crew members, our reputation and ability to operate safely and efficiently may be harmed.\nOur continued success depends in significant part on the continued services of the officers and seamen who operate our vessels. Currently, we believe the market for hiring qualified, experienced officers and seamen is adequate. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain properly skilled personnel at commercially reasonable salaries. Any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to operate cost-effectively.\nA substantial number of our shipboard employees are unionized. In the event of a strike or other work stoppage, our business and operations may be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2015, all of our U.S. shipboard personnel were unionized employees covered by collective bargaining agreements.\nGiven the prevalence of maritime trade unions and their corresponding influence over its members, the shipping industry is vulnerable to work stoppages and other potentially disruptive actions by employees. We may also have difficulty successfully negotiating renewals to our collective bargaining agreements with these unions or face resistance to any future efforts to place restraints on wages, reduce labor costs or moderate work practices. Any of these events may result in strikes, work disruptions and have other potentially adverse consequences. While we have experienced no strikes, work stoppages or other significant labor problems during the last ten years, we cannot assure that such events will not occur in the future or be material in nature. In the event we experience one or more strikes, work stoppages or other labor problems, our business and, in turn, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIncreases in costs for pension and healthcare benefits for our active and retired employees may reduce our profitability and liquidity and increase our funding commitments.\nOur costs of maintaining our pension, healthcare and other plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors, most of which are outside our control, including:\n\u00b7\ndecreases in mortality rates;\n\u00b7\ndecreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts;\n\u00b7\nchanges in prevailing interest rates and the discount rate used to calculate pension and other post-retirement expenses;\n\u00b7\nincreases in healthcare costs generally or claims submitted under our healthcare plans specifically;\n\u00b7\nthe continuing implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the related reconciliation act and regulations promulgated thereunder;\n\u00b7\nincreases in the number of retirees who elect to receive lump sum benefit payments;\n\u00b7\nchanges in plan benefits; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in funding laws or regulations.\nDomestically, we participate in and make periodic contributions to various multi-employer pension plans under union and industry-wide agreements that generally provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. Funding requirements for benefit obligations of multi-employer pension plans are subject to certain regulatory requirements and we may be required to make cash contributions which may be material to one or more of these plans to satisfy certain underfunded benefit obligations. In addition, if a multi-employer plan fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service may impose certain penalties and taxes.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAbsent an applicable exemption, a contributor to a multi-employer plan is liable, upon termination or withdrawal from the plan, for its proportionate share of the plan\u2019s underfunded vested liability. Based on the limited information available from plan administrators, which we cannot independently validate, we believe that our portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination may be material to our financial position and results of operations. Moreover, in the event that any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan that is underfunded, and such employer (or any member in its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal, then we, along with the other remaining contributing employers, would be liable for our proportionate share of such plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefits.\nSome of our employees are covered by laws limiting our protection from exposure to certain claims.\nSome of our employees are covered by several maritime laws, statutes and regulations which circumvent and nullify certain liability limits established by state workers\u2019 compensation laws, including provisions of the Jones Act, the Death on the High Seas Act, and the Seamen\u2019s Wage Act. We are not generally protected by the limits imposed by state workers\u2019 compensation statutes for these particular employees, and, as a result, our exposure for claims asserted by these employees may be greater than the exposure for claims faced by employers in other industries.\nWe are subject to the control of our principal stockholders.\nAs of February 25, 2016, two of our current directors, Niels M. Johnsen and Erik L. Johnsen, and their respective family members and affiliated entities, beneficially owned an aggregate of 20.3% of our common stock. Niels M. Johnsen and Erik L. Johnsen are also executive officers of the Company, and their respective fathers were formerly executive officers and directors. As a result, the Johnsen family may have the ability to exert significant influence over our affairs and management, including the election of directors, delaying or opposing a change of control transaction, and effecting other corporate actions requiring stockholder approval.\nBecause some of our expenses are incurred in foreign currencies, we are exposed to exchange rate risks.\nWhile we incur most of our expenses in U.S. dollars, we have in the past incurred operating expenses in other currencies, most notably the Mexican Peso and Indonesian Rupiah. Declines in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in these jurisdictions, or other currencies in which we may in the future incur expenses, would increase the U.S. dollar cost of paying these expenses and thus would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe selectively enter into hedging derivative contracts, which can result in higher than market interest rates and charges against our income.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may be exposed to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks. From time to time in the past, we have utilized derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swap agreements, forward exchange contracts, and commodity swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures. We hedge only firm commitments or anticipated transactions and do not use derivatives for speculation. We neither hold nor issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Nevertheless, even though our hedging strategies are designed to manage our exposure to changes in market conditions, entering into swaps and forward exchange contracts is inherently risky. The derivative strategies that we employ in the future may not be successful or effective, and we could, as a result, incur substantial additional interest costs or charges against our income.\nThe adoption and implementation of new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act provides for new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions, including foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price hedging transactions. The rules currently adopted under this statute may reduce our ability to execute these types of hedging transactions. Further rulemaking could further reduce our ability to implement hedging transactions. In addition, the banks and other derivatives dealers who are our contractual counterparties are required to comply with extensive new regulation under this statute, which could reduce their willingness to engage in these transactions or increase the fees they charge.\nLoss of our senior management or other key personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success will depend, in significant part, upon the continued services of our senior management team and other key personnel, especially those of our Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chief Financial Officer, who have substantial experience in the shipping industry and approximately 120 years of collective experience with us. We believe that the experience of our senior management team is a vital component to maintaining long-term relationships with our customers. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could adversely affect our future operating results, and we may have to incur significant costs to find sufficient replacements for them, if available.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe are exposed to various tax risks.\nAs a taxpayer, we are subject to frequent and regular audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as state and local tax authorities. Because the ultimate outcomes of these matters are uncertain, we can give no assurance as to whether an adverse result from one or more of them will have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe believe that we should not be subject to tax under the laws of any country other than the United States or Singapore in which we conduct activities or in which our customers are located. However, our belief is based on our understanding of the tax laws of those countries, and our tax position is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law or interpretation. We cannot determine in advance the extent to which certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax or to make payments in lieu of tax. In addition, payments due to us from our customers could potentially be subject to tax claims.\nThe laws governing our ability to utilize net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) are complex. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to utilize our NOLs as anticipated, or that these NOLs will not be depleted sooner than expected. If and when our NOLs are fully utilized, we expect that the amount of our cash flow dedicated to the payment of federal taxes will increase substantially.\nWe could face liabilities as a result of certain legal and regulatory proceedings.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. These matters are subject to many uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters could ultimately be decided, resolved or settled adversely to us. An adverse outcome in a legal or regulatory matter could, depending on the facts, have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nOur business is subject to potential security breaches or other system failures.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, to communicate with our vessels, to manage or support a variety of our other business operations, transactions and processes, and to maintain various records, which may include personally identifiable information of customers, employees or other third parties. We make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and systems (and maintain contingency plans in the event of security breaches or system disruptions). Nonetheless, we have experienced some relatively minor system failures in the past and anticipate experiencing additional failures in the future. We cannot assure you that our security efforts and measures will prevent unauthorized access to our systems, loss or destruction of data, account takeovers, or other forms of cyber-attacks or similar events, whether caused by mechanical failures, human error, fraud, malice, sabotage or otherwise. The frequency, scope and sophistication of cyber-attacks continue to grow, which increases the possibility that our security measures will be unable to prevent our systems\u2019 improper functioning or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information. Any failure of our information or communications systems, whether caused by attacks, mechanical failures, natural disasters or otherwise, could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, or subject us to claims, any of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe are exposed to risks arising out of recent legislation affecting U.S. public companies, including risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and related regulations implemented thereunder, have increased legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time consuming. Any future failure to successfully or timely complete annual assessments of our internal controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could result in several adverse consequences, including those referenced in the next risk factor.\nLapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our operations, profitability or reputation.\nThere can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in the future or that we will not experience a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting. Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose us to regulatory or legal proceedings, including litigation brought by private individuals, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence and our stock price.\nIf conditions or assumptions differ from the judgments, assumptions or estimates used in our accounting policies, the accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. For a discussion of our critical accounting policies, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCondition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies\u201d in Item 7 of this report. If future events or assumptions differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies, these events or assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Other portions of our financial statements also are based on various estimates regarding voyage revenues and expenses, particularly with respect to the percentage-of-completion accounting that we apply with respect to one of our segments. Actual revenues or costs may vary from estimates previously made, which may result in reductions or reversals of previously-recorded net revenues or profits.\nProvisions in our organizational documents would make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if such a transaction is beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur organizational documents:\n\u00b7\nprovide for blank check preferred stock;\n\u00b7\nprevent stockholders from calling special stockholder meetings or voting cumulatively;\n\u00b7\nimpose certain foreign ownership limits with respect to our stock (which are discussed further below); and\n\u00b7\ninclude various other provisions that could impede, delay or prevent certain takeovers or change of control transactions.\nIn addition, as noted under \u201c- We are subject to the control of our principal stockholders,\u201d the Johnsen family beneficially owns a substantial portion of our common stock. These provisions and circumstances could deter a third party from tendering for the purchase of some or all of our shares. These provisions and circumstances may have the effect of impeding, delaying or preventing changes of control of the ownership and management of ISH, even if such transactions would have significant benefits to our stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation limits the ownership of common stock by persons who are not U.S. citizens, which could have certain adverse effects.\nWe must comply with certain stock ownership requirements in order to assure that we will be permitted to engage in United States coastwise trade, as well as participate in certain financing and other maritime programs administered by the U.S. Maritime Administration (\u201cMARAD\u201d). Failure to comply with these requirements could jeopardize our continued eligibility to engage in such coastwise trade and to participate in such MARAD programs. To assure such compliance, our certificate of incorporation (our \u201cCharter\u201d), includes certain provisions designed to enable us to regulate the ownership of our capital stock by persons who are not citizens of the United States.\nOur Charter provides that any transfer or purported transfer of shares of our capital stock that would result in the ownership by Non-Citizens (as defined in our Charter) of our capital stock having more than 23% of the total voting power would generally be void. Voting rights will be denied to any shares owned by Non-Citizens in excess of 23%, (the \u201cExcess Shares\u201d), and we will withhold dividends with respect to such Excess Shares on the terms and conditions specified in the Charter. In addition, our Charter authorizes us to redeem shares of our capital stock owned by Non-Citizens in excess of 23% in order to reduce ownership by Non-Citizens to 23%.\nThese foreign ownership restrictions could limit the trading liquidity of our common stock by reducing our pool of potential stockholders. In addition, if we were to seek to sell any portion of our business that owns any of our Jones Act vessels, we would have fewer potential purchasers, since some potential purchasers might be unable or unwilling to satisfy the foreign ownership restrictions described above. As a result, the sales price for that portion of our business may not attain the amount that could be obtained in an unregulated market.\nFuture acquisitions of vessels or businesses by us would subject us to additional business, operating and industry risks, the impact of which cannot presently be evaluated, and could adversely impact our capital structure.\nFrom time to time in the future we may pursue other acquisition or expansion opportunities in an effort to implement our business strategies. These transactions could involve acquisitions of entire businesses or one or more vessels, and could take several forms, including mergers, joint ventures, investments in new lines of business, or the purchase of equity interests or assets. These types of transactions may present significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenue acquired to offset liabilities assumed, unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, regulatory or compliance issues, potential violations of covenants in our debt instruments and other unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. To the extent we acquire a business that is financially unstable or is otherwise subject to a high level of risk, we may be affected by the currently unascertainable risks of that business. Accordingly, there is no current basis for you to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the particular business or assets that we may acquire. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that any such transaction will ultimately result in the realization of the benefits of the transaction originally anticipated by us or that any such transaction will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn addition, the financing of any future acquisition completed by us could adversely impact our capital structure as any such financing would likely include the issuance of additional securities or the borrowing of additional funds. Except as required by law or the rules of any securities exchange on which our securities might be listed at the time we seek to consummate an acquisition, we do not expect to ask our stockholders to vote on any proposed acquisition.", "PERMNO": 45437, "SIC": 4400, "TIC": "ISHCQ"}
