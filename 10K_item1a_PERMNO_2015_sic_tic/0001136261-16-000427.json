Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects, and the prevailing market price and performance of our common stock, may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the matters discussed below. Certain statements and information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as other written or oral statements made from time to time by us or by our authorized officers on our behalf, constitute \"forward- looking statements.\" You should note that our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or when made and we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Although we believe that the expectations, plans, intentions and projections reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, such statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\nWe have identified the following categories of risk that should be considered by investors:\nRisks related to the sale of substantially all of our assets\nRisks related to our business, industry and regulatory matters;\nRisks related to our financial results;\nRisks related to our intellectual property and potential litigation; and\nRisks related to ownership of our common stock.\nCertain of the risks identified under \"Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Regulatory Matters,\" \"Risks Related to Our Financial Results,\" and \"Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Potential Litigation,\" describe factors that have historically posed risks to us and that could in the future adversely affect us if we are unable to continue operating our business, or if we acquire a business in the same or related industry in the future.\nRisks Related to the Sale of Substantially all of our Assets\nWe face risks associated with enforcing Arthrex's obligation to make royalty payments under the asset purchase agreement or may receive royalty payments that are substantially less than our expectations.\nAs partial consideration for the Reconstructive Division asset sale under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, Arthrex agreed to pay us an amount equal to 5% of net sales of the products of our Reconstructive Division acquired pursuant to the asset purchase agreement. The royalty has been and we expect will continue to be paid in cash on a quarterly basis, for a period up to and including the 20th anniversary of the closing. We may experience difficulties collecting or enforcing the royalty payments over time, including if we fail to have the adequate resources, including personnel, to verify the underlying net sales. Additionally, we may ultimately collect royalty payments that are substantially less than our expectations if any of our intellectual property related to the Reconstructive Division assets becomes invalidated or rendered unenforceable due to Arthrex's right under the terms of the asset purchase agreement to set-off against the royalty payment due any and all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in good faith arising out of claims by unaffiliated third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights.\nWe have made certain changes to our remaining assets and operations which may adversely affect our reputation or future results or prospects.\nPursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement relating to the sale of substantially all of the Reconstructive Division assets, we have changed our name, logos, trade dress, trade names, trademarks, service marks and the like to new names that are reasonably satisfactory to Arthrex and do not use the words \"Cardo\" or any variation thereof. Upon the closing of the sale of the Reconstructive Division assets, we changed our name to Tiger X Medical, Inc. These changes eliminated any brand recognition, brand equity or loyalty we have developed over our operating history and may adversely affect our future reputation or future results or prospects.\nIf our operations continue to consist of the receipt and management of royalty payments and promoting our former knee products, we will have limited operating businesses.\nIn October 2010, our management and Board of Directors decided to put substantially all of our assets up for sale. Due to the completion of the sales of the Reconstructive Division assets and Spine Division assets, our operating business consists of the ownership and management of our remaining assets, which includes promoting our former product lines through participation in mobile teaching labs, seminars and live surgery, and the receipt and management of royalty payments pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement. Without additional operating business, we will not realize any revenues other than through the royalty payments we are entitled to under the terms of the Reconstructive Division asset sale and any future acquisition of an operating business or assets.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Regulatory Matters\nWe may not be able to raise additional funds in the future, on acceptable terms or at all, to fund any future investment opportunities, including the acquisition of a business or assets.\nWe are evaluating future investment opportunities and uses for our cash. We may in the future elect to acquire another entity or invest the net proceeds from the sale of the Reconstructive Division assets and/or our Spine Division assets in such manner as is determined by our Board of Directors and management. In order to consummate any future investment opportunity, we may need to secure additional funds. We cannot assure you that debt or equity financing, if and when required, will be available. Prior to agreeing to the sale of the Reconstructive Division assets, we were pursuing efforts to secure additional funding for our business, but we were not successful. The market for debt and equity financing is challenging and the additional financing that we may require in the future may not be available at all or, if available, may be on terms unfavorable to us and our stockholders, and could substantially dilute current ownership interests.\nOur actual capital requirements may change as a result of various factors, including:\nthe nature and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions, if any;\nour ability to manage costs; and the time and costs involved in filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent and intellectual property claims, if any.\nAny of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to attract and retain necessary personnel, in the event of any future acquisition of an operating business or assets, may adversely affect or delay our future results or prospects.\nIf we identify any future investment opportunities and uses for our cash, including the acquisition of a business or assets, we will need to attract and retain necessary personnel to consummate such transaction and operate such business or assets going forward. Our success in that case will depend on our ability to continuously attract and retain the necessary highly qualified personnel and develop any necessary relationships or collaborations necessary or advantageous for the operation of such business or assets. The competition for qualified personnel and collaborators is intense. We may not be able to attract or retain such personnel or cultivate such collaborations in the future. Our inability to hire or retain qualified personnel or cultivate necessary collaborations in the event of any future acquisition of an operating business or assets may adversely affect our future results or prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Potential Litigation\nThe medical device industry is characterized by patent and other intellectual property litigation, and we could become subject to litigation that could be costly, result in diverting management's time and efforts, require us to pay damages, and/or prevent us from marketing our existing or future products.\nThe medical device market in which we primarily participate is in large part technology-driven. Physician customers move quickly to new products and new technologies. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. However, intellectual property litigation to defend or create market advantage is inherently complex, unpredictable, time-consuming and costly. Furthermore, appellate courts frequently overturn lower court patent decisions.\nIn addition, competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties. In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of medical devices. These forces frequently drive settlement not only of individual cases, but also of a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases. In addition, although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought, remedies and restitution generally are not determined until the conclusion of the proceedings and are frequently modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies.\nWe also may have to take legal action in the future to protect our remaining patents, trade secrets or know-how or to assert them against claimed infringement by others. Any legal action of that type could be costly and time-consuming, and we cannot assure you that any lawsuit will be successful. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources, including personnel, to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against a challenge.\nFor the reasons indicated above, enforcing our remaining intellectual property rights may be costly, difficult and time-consuming. Even if successful, litigation to enforce our remaining intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge could be expensive and time-consuming and could divert our limited management's attention.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our past or present employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nSome of our past or present employees and consultants were previously employed or engaged at universities or other medical device companies, including our past competitors or potential competitors. We could in the future be subject to claims that these past or present employees and consultants, or we, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail to defend against these claims, a court could order us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to our products and processes, if these technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management.\nPotential future product liability claims and other litigation, including contract litigation, may adversely affect our future results and prospects.\nReconstructive and spine surgery involves a high risk of serious complications, including bleeding, nerve injury, paralysis and even death. As a result, we are exposed to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the testing, manufacture and sale of medical devices for surgery procedures that were part of the Reconstructive Division and Spine Division assets sold during 2011. Many of these medical devices are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. A number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient with respect to these or other products that we manufacture or sell, including component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information. These factors could result in product liability claims, a recall of one or more products or a safety alert relating to one or more products. Product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class.\nIn connection with our acquisition of the assets of Accin Corporation, which we refer to as Accin, in May 2007 (through our ownership of Accelerated Innovation, which we refer to as Accelerated Innovation, one of our former subsidiaries) and as a result of the reverse merger we completed in August 2008, which we refer to as the Merger, we assumed the responsibility for any litigation or claims related to Accin's business, including product liability claims relating to products previously sold by Accin. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, including not only actual damages, but also punitive damages. The magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, the cost to defend against any future litigation may be significant.\nAlthough we currently maintain product liability tail insurance in amounts that we believe are typical for companies of comparable size, our product liability insurance may prove to be inadequate to pay a damage award, in which case we may have to pay the excess out of our cash reserves, which may harm our financial condition. If longer-term patient results and experience indicate that what were previously our products under the Reconstructive Division or Spine Division or any component may cause tissue damage, motor impairment or other adverse effects, we could be subject to significant liability. Finally, even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could harm our reputation in the industry and lead to significant legal fees.\nEven if any product liability loss is covered by our product liability tail insurance policy, these policies have substantial retentions or deductibles that provide that insurance proceeds are not recoverable until the losses incurred exceed the amount of those retentions or deductibles. To the extent that any losses are below these retentions or deductibles, we will be responsible for paying these losses. Paying retentions or deductibles for a significant amount of claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and our future results and prospects.\nAfter the term of our product liability tail insurance, we will be self-insured with respect to general and product liability claims. The absence of significant third- party insurance coverage increases potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions. As a result, product liability claims, product recalls and other litigation in the future, regardless of their outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, and our future results and prospects.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur common stock is thinly traded.\nThere is a very minimal public market for our common stock and our common stock has become more thinly traded after the consummation of the sale of substantially all of the Reconstructive Division assets and the Spine Division assets. We cannot predict how liquid the market for our common stock might become.\nTrades of our common stock are conducted on the OTC Bulletin Board. If our common stock remains listed on the OTC Bulletin Board or is suspended from the OTC Bulletin Board, the trading price of our common stock could suffer, the trading market for our common stock may be less liquid and our common stock price may be subject to increased volatility.\nFurthermore, for companies whose securities are traded in the OTC Bulletin Board, it is more difficult to obtain accurate stock quotations and raise needed capital. Also, because major wire services generally do not publish press releases about these companies, it is also more difficult for them to obtain coverage for significant news and events.\nIn addition, the price at which our common stock may be sold is very unpredictable because there are very few trades in our common stock. We cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for our common stock will develop or be sustained at any time in the future. While our common stock is thinly traded, a large block of shares traded can lead to a dramatic fluctuation in the share price.\nOur common stock has fluctuated substantially and we expect that the price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate substantially, potentially adversely affecting the ability of investors to sell their shares.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically been highly volatile and has fluctuated between $0.06 and $0.20 since the sale of substantially all of our Reconstructive Division assets and Spine Division assets. The market price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to the following factors, many of which are generally beyond our control. These factors may include:\nthe acquisition or divestiture of businesses, products, assets or technology;\ndisputes, litigation or other developments with respect to intellectual property rights or other potential legal actions; and\ngeneral market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.\nMarket price fluctuations may negatively affect the ability of investors to sell our shares at consistent prices.\nWe may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management's attention and harm its business.\nThe stock market in general and the stocks of medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme percentage price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies involved. If these fluctuations occur in the future, the market price of our shares could fall regardless of any future investment opportunities we may pursue or our future operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company's securities, securities class action litigation has been brought against that company. If the market price or volume of our shares suffers extreme fluctuations, then we may become involved in this type of litigation which would be expensive and divert our management's attention and resources.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our Board of Directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions:\nimpose limitations on our stockholders to call special stockholder meetings; and\nauthorize the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued by the Board of Directors without prior stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of the common stock.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our Board of Directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current Board of Directors, including to delay or impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. Any delay or prevention of a change in control transaction or changes in our Board of Directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nBecause our common stock is a \"penny stock,\" it may be more difficult for investors to sell shares of our common stock, and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nOur common stock is considered a \"penny stock\" if, among other things, the stock price is below $5.00 per share (our shares of common stock have been trading at between $0.06 and $0.20 since the sales of substantially all of our Reconstructive Division assets and Spine Division assets), we are not listed for trading on a national securities exchange or approved for quotation on the Nasdaq Stock Market or any other national stock exchange (we are currently traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board), or we have not met certain net tangible asset or average revenue requirements. Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks must provide purchasers of these stocks with a standardized risk- disclosure document prepared by the SEC. This document provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks involved in investing in the penny-stock market. A broker also must give a purchaser, orally or in writing, bid and offer quotations and information regarding broker and salesperson compensation, make a written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser, and obtain the purchaser's written agreement to the purchase. In addition, broker-dealers must provide customers that hold penny stock in their accounts with that broker-dealer a monthly statement containing price and market information relating to the penny stock. If a penny stock is sold to an investor in violation of the penny stock rules, the investor may be able to cancel its purchase and get its money back.\nIf applicable, the penny stock rules may make it difficult for investors to sell their shares of our common stock. Because of the rules and restrictions applicable to a penny stock, there is less trading in penny stocks and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected. Also, many brokers choose not to participate in penny stock transactions. Accordingly, investors may not always be able to resell their shares of our common stock publicly at times and prices that they feel are appropriate.\nDirectors, executive officers, principal stockholders and affiliated entities own a significant percentage of our capital stock, and they may make decisions that you do not consider to be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nAs of March 18, 2016, our directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and affiliated entities beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 62% of our outstanding voting securities, of which approximately 42% is owned by Andrew Brooks, our CEO and acting CFO, and his brother, Jon Brooks. As a result, if some or all of them acted together, they would have the ability to exert substantial influence over the election of our Board of Directors and the outcome of issues requiring approval by our stockholders. This concentration of ownership also may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company that may be favored by other stockholders.\nThis could prevent transactions in which stockholders might otherwise recover a premium for their shares over current market prices.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which we refer to as Section 404, requires management's annual review and evaluation of our internal control systems. We currently only have one employee and limited consultants who we may engage from time to time who will continue to expend time documenting and testing our internal control systems and procedures. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. Absolute assurance also cannot be provided that testing will reveal all material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting.\nPrivately-held businesses are not subject to the same requirements for internal controls as public companies. While we intend to address any material weaknesses at acquired companies, there is no assurance that this will be accomplished. If we fail to maintain the effectiveness of acquired companies' internal controls, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nCompliance with changing regulations concerning corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.\nThere have been changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure promulgated by the SEC and rules promulgated by national securities exchanges. These new or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Our board members, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers, which could harm our business. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, we could be subject to liability under applicable laws or our reputation may be harmed.\nStockholders may experience significant dilution if future equity offerings are used to fund operations or acquire complementary businesses.\nIf future operations or acquisitions are financed through issuing equity securities, stockholders could experience significant dilution. In addition, securities issued in connection with future financing activities or potential acquisitions may have rights and preferences senior to the rights and preferences of our common stock. The issuance of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of options outstanding under employee benefit plans may result in dilution to our stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock, if any.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently expect to use available funds and any future earnings to pursue future investment opportunities, including the acquisition of businesses or assets, and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of any future debt or credit facility we may obtain may preclude us from paying any dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be an investor's only source of potential gain from our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation grants our Board of Directors the power to designate and issue additional shares of common and/or preferred stock.\nOur authorized capital consists of 750,000,000 shares of common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our preferred stock may be designated into series pursuant to authority granted by our Certificate of Incorporation, and on approval from our Board of Directors. The Board of Directors, without any action by our stockholders, may designate and issue shares in classes or series as the Board of Directors deems appropriate and establish the rights, preferences and privileges of those shares, including dividends, liquidation and voting rights. The rights of holders of other classes or series of stock that may be issued could be superior to the rights of holders of our common shares. The designation and issuance of shares of capital stock having preferential rights could adversely affect other rights appurtenant to shares of our common stock. Furthermore, any issuances of additional stock (common or preferred) will dilute the percentage of ownership interest of then-current holders of our capital stock and may dilute our book value per share.", "PERMNO": 18894, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "BCDA"}
