{"cik": "64040", "company": "MCGRAW HILL FINANCIAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-13", "item_1A": "Item 1a. Risk Factors\nWe are providing the following cautionary statements which identify all known material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical and expected results.\nWe operate in the capital, commodities and commercial markets. The capital markets include asset managers, banks, exchanges, issuers and financial advisors; the commodities markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, metals, and agriculture; and the commercial markets include professionals and corporate executives within marketing / research information services. Certain risk factors are applicable to certain of our individual segments while other risk factors are applicable company-wide.\nExposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022\nIn the normal course of business, both in the United States and abroad, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries, as discussed under Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we face the risk that additional proceedings, investigations and inquiries will arise in the future.\n\u2022\nMany of these proceedings, investigations and inquiries relate to the ratings activity of S&P Ratings brought by issuers and alleged purchasers of rated securities. In addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to ratings activities and antitrust matters.\n\u2022\nAny of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022\nIn view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of the matters we are currently facing or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that the outcome of the matters we are currently facing or that we may face in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022\nAs litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we continuously review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business and competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.\n\u2022\nLegal proceedings impose additional expenses on the Company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues.\n\u2022\nRisks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the United States. In addition, new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards, shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements, thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. These litigation risks\nare often difficult to assess or quantify and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022\nWe may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks, and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in the volume of securities issued and traded in domestic and/or global capital markets and changes in interest rates and volatility in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022\nOur business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the United States and world financial markets. Therefore, since a significant component of our credit-rating based revenue is transaction-based, and is essentially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets, unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers\u2019 willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuances for which S&P Ratings provides credit ratings.\n\u2022\nIncreases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, the level of derivatives trading and/or the types of credit-sensitive products being offered, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022\nAny weakness in the macroeconomic environment could constrain customer budgets across the markets we serve, potentially leading to a reduction in their employee headcount and a decrease in demand for our subscription-based products.\nIncreasing regulation of our S&P Ratings business in the United States and abroad can increase our costs of doing business and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe financial services industry is highly regulated, rapidly evolving and subject to the potential for increasing regulation in the United States and abroad. The businesses conducted by S&P Ratings are in certain cases regulated under the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 (the \u201cReform Act\u201d), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business.\n\u2022\nIn the past several years, the U.S. Congress, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (\"IOSCO\"), the SEC and the European Commission, including through the European Securities Market Authority (\"ESMA\"), as well as regulators in other countries in which S&P Ratings operates, have been reviewing the role of rating agencies and their processes and the need for greater oversight or regulations concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies. Other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local, national, foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings, rotation of credit rating agencies and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies.\n\u2022\nThese laws and regulations, and any future rulemaking, could result in reduced demand for credit ratings and increased costs, which we may be unable to pass through to customers. In addition, there may be uncertainty over the scope, interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations. We may be required to incur significant expenses in order to ensure compliance and mitigate the risk of fines, penalties or other sanctions. Legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be uncertainty over and exposure to liability. It is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on our business and our customers\u2019 businesses, and they may affect S&P Ratings\u2019 communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, alter the manner in which S&P Ratings\u2019 ratings are developed, affect the manner in which S&P Ratings or its customers or users of credit ratings operate, impact the demand for ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business. Each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on our operations, profitability and competitiveness, the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized.\n\u2022\nAdditional information regarding rating agencies is provided under Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur S&P DJ Indices and C&C businesses are subject to the potential for increasing regulatory review in the United States and abroad, which can increase our costs of doing business and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022\nIn addition to the extensive and evolving U.S. laws and regulations, foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to increase regulation of the financial services industry.\n\u2022\nOn October 5, 2012, IOSCO issued its Principles for Oil Price Reporting Agencies (\"PRA Principles\"), which IOSCO states are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments that are referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by IOSCO members. Platts has taken steps to align its operations with the PRA Principles and, as recommended by IOSCO in its final report on the PRA Principles, is in the process of completing its alignment to the PRA Principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks. The cost of compliance with the PRA Principles as well as obtaining annual third-party reviews of its adherence to the PRA Principles will increase Platts\u2019 cost of doing business.\n\u2022\nIn July 2013, IOSCO issued its Principles for Financial Benchmarks (\"Financial Benchmark Principles\"), which are intended to promote the reliability of benchmark determinations, and address governance, benchmark quality and accountability mechanisms, including with regard to the indices published by S&P DJ Indices. S&P DJ Indices has taken steps to align its operations with the Financial Benchmark Principles.\n\u2022\nBenchmark regulation is continuing to be considered in the European Union, and at the same time the United Kingdom is also reviewing its domestic framework for the supervision of benchmark administrators; as a result of these measures, as well as measures that could be taken in other jurisdictions outside of Europe, S&P DJ Indices and Platts could, in due course, be required to obtain registration or authorization in connection with their benchmark and price assessment activities in Europe and elsewhere.\n\u2022\nThe European Union has recently finalized a package of legislative measures known as MiFID II (\"MiFID II\"), which revise and update the existing E.U. Markets in Financial Instruments Directive framework. MiFID II will apply in full in all E.U. Member States from January 3, 2017. MiFID II includes provisions that, among other things: (i) impose new conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks and provide for non-discriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses; (ii) modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives; (iii) expand the categories of trading venue that are subject to regulation; and (iv) provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges (complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the E.U. Market Infrastructure Regulation of 2011). Although the MiFID II package is \u201cframework\u201d legislation (meaning that much of the detail of the rules will be set out in subordinate measures to be agreed upon in the period before 2017), it is possible that the introduction of these laws and rules could affect S&P DJ Indices\u2019 and Platts\u2019 abilities both to administer and license their indices and price assessments, respectively.\nChanges to regulations in the United States and abroad may impact our S&P Capital IQ business by increasing the costs of doing business globally, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022\nS&P Capital IQ operates regulated businesses in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other countries. These businesses and other S&P Capital IQ businesses may increasingly become subject to new or more stringent regulations that will increase the cost of doing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022\nMiFID II and the Market Abuse Regulation (\u201cMAR\u201d) likely will impose additional regulatory burdens on McGraw Hill Financial Research Europe Limited (\"MHFRE\") activities in the European Union, although the exact severity and cost are not yet known.\nWe may become subject to liability based on the use of our products by our clients.\n\u2022\nSome of our products support the investment processes of our clients, which, in the aggregate, manage trillions of dollars of assets. Use of our products as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients, or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients, may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts.\n\u2022\nAny such claim, even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us, would involve a significant commitment of our management, personnel, financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation. In addition, such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreased competition could result in a loss of market share or revenue.\n\u2022\nThe markets for credit ratings, financial research, investment and advisory services, index-based products, and commodities price assessments and related news and information about the commodities markets are intensely competitive. S&P Ratings, S&P Capital IQ, S&P DJ Indices and C&C compete domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its ratings, research and advisory services, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation.\n\u2022\nWhile our businesses face competition from traditional content and analytics providers, we also face competition from non-traditional providers such as exchanges, asset managers, investment banks and technology-led companies that are adding content and analytics capabilities to their core businesses.\n\u2022\nIn addition, in some of the countries in which S&P Ratings competes, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies and may from time to time establish official credit rating agencies, credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers.\n\u2022\nSustained downward pressure on oil and other commodities prices and trading activity in those markets could have a material adverse effect on the rate of growth of Platts\u2019 revenue, including subscription and licensing fees.\nIntroduction of new products, services or technologies could impact our profitability.\n\u2022\nWe operate in highly competitive markets that continue to change to adapt to customer needs. In order to maintain a competitive position, we must continue to invest in new offerings and new ways to deliver our products and services. These investments may not be profitable or may be less profitable than what we have experienced historically.\n\u2022\nWe could experience threats to our existing businesses from the rise of new competitors due to the rapidly changing environment in which we operate.\n\u2022\nWe rely on our information technology environment and certain critical databases, systems and applications to support key product and service offerings. We believe we have appropriate policies, processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of our information technology, provide security from unauthorized access to our systems and maintain business continuity, but our business could be subject to significant disruption and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access to our systems.\nA significant increase in operating costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\n\u2022\nOur major expenses include employee compensation and capital investments.\n\u2022\nWe offer competitive salary and benefit packages in order to attract and retain the quality employees required to grow and expand our businesses. Compensation costs are influenced by general economic factors, including those affecting the cost of health insurance and postretirement benefits, and any trends specific to the employee skill sets we require.\n\u2022\nWe make significant investments in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives and we cannot provide assurances that such investments will result in increased revenues.\n\u2022\nAlthough we believe we are prudent in our investment strategies and execution of our implementation plans, there is no assurance as to the ultimate recoverability of these investments.\nConsolidation of customers as well as staffing levels across our customer base could impact our available markets and revenue growth.\n\u2022\nOur businesses have a customer base which is largely comprised of members from the financial services industry. The current challenging business environment and the consolidation of customers resulting from mergers and acquisitions in\nthe financial services industry can result in reductions in the number of firms and workforce which can impact the size of our customer base.\n\u2022\nCustomers within the financial services and commodities industries that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on our products and services. If a large number of smaller customers or a critical number of larger customers reduce their spending with us, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\u2022\nAlternatively, customers may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial and commodity market products and services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors, including by selecting other vendors with lower-cost offerings, or by self-sourcing their need for financial and commodity market products and services. If customers elect to consolidate their spending on financial and commodity market products and services with other vendors and not us, if we lose business to lower priced competitors, or if customers elect to self-source their product and service needs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\u2022\nA material portion of our revenues in our S&P DJ Indices business is concentrated in some of our largest customers, who have significant assets under management in index funds and exchange-traded funds. A loss of a substantial portion of revenue from our largest customers could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed, we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire.\n\u2022\nOur ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers, including certain data, software and service suppliers. Some of our products are dependent upon (and of little value without) updates from our data suppliers and most of our information and data products are dependent upon (and of little value without) continuing access to historical and current data.\n\u2022\nWe utilize certain data provided by third-party data sources in a variety of ways, including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world.\n\u2022\nIf the data from our suppliers has errors, is delayed, has design defects, is unavailable on acceptable terms or is not available at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022\nSome of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice. Termination of one or more of our significant data agreements or exclusion from, or restricted use of, or litigation in connection with, a data provider\u2019s information could decrease the available information for us to use (and offer our clients) and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in the legislative, regulatory, and commercial environments in which we operate may materially and adversely impact our ability to collect, compile, use, and publish data and may impact our financial results.\n\u2022\nCertain types of information we collect, compile, use, and publish, including offerings in our C&C business, are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, there is increasing concern among certain privacy advocates and government regulators regarding marketing and privacy matters, particularly as they relate to individual privacy interests.\n\u2022\nThese concerns may result in new or amended laws and regulations. Future laws and regulations with respect to the collection, compilation, use, and publication of information and consumer privacy could result in limitations on our operations, increased compliance or litigation expense, adverse publicity, or loss of revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. It is also possible that we could be prohibited from collecting or disseminating certain types of data, which could affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 needs.\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property rights could impact our competitive position.\n\u2022\nOur products contain intellectual property delivered through a variety of media, including print and digital. Our ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property against infringement. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets.\nWe face legal, economic and regulatory risks of operating in foreign jurisdictions.\n\u2022\nAs we continue to expand our operations overseas, we face the increased risks of doing business abroad, including:\n\u2022\ninflation,\n\u2022\nfluctuation in interest rates and currency exchange rates,\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars,\n\u2022\ndiffering accounting principles and standards,\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences,\n\u2022\nthe costs of repatriating cash held by entities outside the United States,\n\u2022\ndiffering legal or civil liability, compliance and regulatory standards,\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable laws and regulatory requirements,\n\u2022\nexport and import restrictions, tariffs, other trade barriers, nationalization, expropriation, limits on repatriation of funds, the possibility of nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions,\n\u2022\ncompetition with local rating agencies that have greater familiarity, longer operating histories and/or support from local governments or other institutions,\n\u2022\ncivil unrest, terrorism, unstable governments and legal systems, and other factors.\n\u2022\nAdverse developments in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022\nAdditionally, we are subject to complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. Although we have implemented internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices, such measures may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations.\n\u2022\nAny determination that we have violated anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022\nCompliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Violations of such laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges to our financial processing systems and the transition of certain of our support functions to selected outsource providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022\nWe are in the process of changing certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution. There can be no certainty that these initiatives will deliver the expected benefits. The failure to implement these changes successfully may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently and could lead to business disruption.\n\u2022\nIn addition, we have outsourced certain support functions to third-party service providers to leverage leading specialized capabilities and achieve cost efficiencies. If the service providers to which we have outsourced these functions to do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and, depending on the function involved, we may experience business disruption, processing inefficiencies, or harm employee morale.\nWe rely heavily on network systems and the Internet and any failures or disruptions may adversely affect our ability to serve our customers.\n\u2022\nMany of our products and services are delivered electronically, and our customers rely on our ability to process transactions rapidly and deliver substantial quantities of data on computer-based networks. Our customers also depend on the continued capacity, reliability and security of our electronic delivery systems, our websites and the Internet.\n\u2022\nOur ability to deliver our products and services electronically may be impaired due to infrastructure or network failures, malicious or defective software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third-party Internet providers or increased government regulation.\n\u2022\nDelays in our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may harm our reputation and result in the loss of customers. In addition, a number of our customers entrust us with storing and securing their data and information on our servers.\n\u2022\nAlthough we have disaster recovery plans that include backup facilities for our primary data centers, our systems are not always fully redundant, and our disaster planning may not always be sufficient or effective. As such, these disruptions may affect our ability to store, handle and secure such data and information.\nOur operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022\nOur ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located, including New York City, the location of our headquarters, and major cities worldwide in which we have offices.\n\u2022\nThis may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure used by us or third parties with or through whom we conduct business, whether due to human error, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, political unrest, war or otherwise. Our efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of our major operating systems may not be successful.\n\u2022\nWe rely on third-party providers to provide certain essential services. While we believe that such providers are reliable, we have limited control over the performance of such providers. To the extent any of our third-party providers ceases to provide these services in an efficient, cost-effective manner or fail to adequately expand its services to meet our needs and the needs of our customers, we could experience lower revenues and higher costs.\n\u2022\nWe also do not have fully redundant systems for most of our smaller office locations and low-risk systems, and our disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non-essential services. If a disruption occurs in one of our locations or systems and our personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations, such persons\u2019 ability to service and interact with our clients and customers may suffer.\n\u2022\nWe cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from our failure, or the failure of a third party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. A disruption to our operations or infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information.\n\u2022\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive and other types of information in our computer systems and networks and those of our third party vendors.\n\u2022\nThe cyber risks we face range from cyber-attacks common to most industries, to more advanced threats that target us because of our prominence in the global marketplace, or due to our ratings of sovereign debt. Breaches of our or our vendors\u2019 technology and systems, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, computer viruses or malware, employee error, malfeasance, physical breaches or other actions, may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our or such vendors\u2019 web sites, applications or data processing, or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information regarding us or our business or customers.\n\u2022\nMeasures that we take to avoid or mitigate material incidents can be expensive, and may be insufficient, circumvented, or may become obsolete. Any material incidents could cause us to experience reputational harm, loss of customers, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us.\n\u2022\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not produce anticipated results.\n\u2022\nWe have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions to strengthen our business and grow our Company.\n\u2022\nSuch transactions present significant challenges and risks.\n\u2022\nThe market for acquisition targets and other strategic transactions is highly competitive, especially in light of industry consolidation, which may affect our ability to complete such transactions.\n\u2022\nIf we are unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022\nIf such transactions are completed, the anticipated growth and other strategic objectives of such transactions may not be fully realized, and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions. For instance, the process of integration may require more resources than anticipated, we may assume unintended liabilities, there may be unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures, we may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business and such transactions may divert management\u2019s focus from other business operations.\n\u2022\nThe anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction may not be realized fully, or may take longer to realize than expected. As a result, the failure of acquisitions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 17478, "SIC": 7323, "TIC": "SPGI"}
