{"cik": "51434", "company": "INTERNATIONAL PAPER CO /NEW/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global, regional, and local events that could have an adverse impact on its reputation, operations, and financial performance. The Board of Directors exercises oversight of the Company\u2019s enterprise risk management program, which includes strategic, operational and financial matters, as well as compliance and legal risks. The Audit and Finance Committee coordinates the risk oversight role exercised by the Board\u2019s standing committees and management, and it receives updates on the risk management processes twice per year.\nIn addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (particularly in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), or in the Company\u2019s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the following are some important factors that could cause the\nCompany\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. If any of the events or circumstances described in any of the following risk factors occurs, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, and our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in any forward-looking statements we make in any public disclosures.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nTHE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON PORTIONS OF OUR BUSINESS, AND MAY HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS, PARTICULARLY IF PUBLIC HEALTH AND/OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19 PERSIST OR DETERIORATE. During 2021, there continued to be a large number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States and throughout the world, and restrictive measures, including mask and vaccine requirements, were implemented or reinstituted by various governmental authorities and private businesses. Economic recovery in the United States and various other regions of the world has continued but may be threatened by the continued adverse public health impacts of COVID-19 and other factors.\nMost of our manufacturing and converting facilities have remained open and operational during the pandemic, and at the current time our manufacturing and converting facilities are generally operational. While we have been able to manage through the worst of the pandemic to date, there remain many unknowns about the future phases of the pandemic. Any significant disruption in operations at one or more of our mills, plants or other facilities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our business or operations.\nOur operations have recently experienced and may continue to experience, supply chain constraints and disruptions, higher supply chain costs and a constrained transportation environment due in part to the impacts of COVID-19. Moreover, due to the competitive labor market, we have experienced and may continue to experience, a shortage of labor for certain positions and increased labor costs.\nIn addition to these higher costs, other potential negative impacts on our business, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022We rely on a global workforce, and we take measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers and others with whom we do business, while continuing to effectively manage our employees and maintain business operations. During the pandemic, we have taken additional measures and incurred additional expenses to protect the health and safety of our employees to comply with applicable government requirements and safety guidance. Our business operations may be disrupted if a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work safely and effectively due to illness, quarantines, vaccine or test mandates, government actions, or other restrictions or measures enacted in response to the pandemic.\n\u2022A significant number of our employees as well as customers and others with whom we do business, continue to work remotely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business operations may be disrupted if a significant portion of our workforce or certain business operations are negatively impacted as a result of remote work arrangements, including due to increased cyber risks or other disruption to our technology infrastructure.\nWhile we are closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business, the extent of the impact on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, and financial performance, as well as our ability to execute near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives, will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments, which are highly uncertain and which we cannot predict or control, and some of which we are not currently aware, including, but not limited to: (a) the duration, severity and scope of the pandemic, including the potential for additional variants (including potential variants that may be more resistant to currently available vaccines), waves, increases and spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases in various areas from time to time; (b) governmental and public health directives and/or actions taken by our customers, vendors and other private businesses generally, including vaccine, testing and mask requirements, to contain and combat the outbreak, including the duration, degree and effectiveness of such requirements, as well as the easing, removal and potential reinstitution of such requirements; (c) the availability, acceptance, effectiveness and administration of medical treatments, vaccines and booster shots for COVID-19; (d) the extent and duration of the pandemic\u2019s impact on economic conditions and social activity, including with respect to\ninflationary pressures, supply chain shortages and disruptions, consumer confidence, discretionary spending and preferences, labor market conditions, labor and healthcare costs, and unemployment rates, any of which may adversely impact our business; and (e) any temporary reduction in our workforce, closures of our offices and facilities and our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations.\nThe pandemic has had, and we expect the pandemic to continue to have, an adverse effect on portions of our business. Moreover, the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, or financial condition if public health and/or global economic conditions persist or deteriorate.\nRISKS RELATED TO CLIMATE AND WEATHER\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO PHYSICAL, OPERATIONAL, TRANSITIONAL AND FINANCIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND GLOBAL, REGIONAL AND LOCAL WEATHER CONDITIONS AS WELL AS BY LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND MARKET RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE. Climate change impacts, including rising temperatures and the increasing severity and/or frequency of adverse weather conditions, may result in operational impacts on our facilities, supply chain disruptions and increased raw material and other costs. These adverse weather conditions and other physical impacts which may be exacerbated as the result of climate change include floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, hailstorms, wildfires, snow, ice storms, drought, the spread of disease and insect infestations. Climate change may also contribute to the decreased productivity of forests and adverse impacts on the distribution and abundance of species, the spread of disease and insect epidemics, any of which developments could adversely affect timber harvesting. The effects of climate change and global, regional and local weather conditions, including the resulting financial costs, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.\nThere has been an increased focus, including from investors, the general public and U.S. and foreign governmental and nongovernmental authorities, regarding environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, including with respect to climate change, GHG emissions, packaging and waste, sustainable supply chain practices, deforestation, and land, energy and water use. This increased awareness with respect to ESG matters, including climate change, may result in more prescriptive reporting requirements with respect to ESG metrics, an expectation that such metrics will be voluntarily disclosed by companies such as ours, and increased\npressure to make commitments, set targets, or establish goals, and take action to meet them. As the result of this increased focus and our commitment to ESG matters, we have voluntarily provided disclosure and established targets and goals with respect to various ESG matters, including climate change. For example, we have made public commitments regarding our intended reduction of carbon emissions, including our Vision 2030 Goal of reducing Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 35% and establishing science-based targets to reduce those emissions. Meeting these and other ESG targets and goals, have increased and may continue to increase our capital and operational costs. Further, there can be no assurance regarding the extent to which our climate and other ESG targets will be achieved, and the achievement of these targets is subject to various risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside our control. Moreover, there is no assurance that investments made in furtherance of achieving such targets and goals will meet investor expectations or any binding or non-binding legal standards regarding sustainability performance. If we are unable to meet these climate and other ESG targets and goals, this failure could adversely impact our reputation as well as investor, customer and other stakeholder relationships, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. Moreover, not all of our competitors may seek to establish climate or other ESG targets and goals at a comparable level to ours, which could result in lower supply chain or operating costs for competitors.\nOther climate-related business risks that we face include risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy, such as increased prices for fuels; the introduction of a carbon tax; increased regulations; and more stringent and/or complex environmental and other permitting requirements. To the extent that climate-related business risks materialize, particularly if we are unprepared for them, we may incur unexpected costs, and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATING TO INDUSTRY CONDITIONS\nCHANGES IN THE COST OR AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS, ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION COULD AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. We rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials (principally virgin wood fiber, recycled fiber, caustic soda, starch and adhesives), energy sources (principally biomass, natural gas, electricity and fuel oil) and third-party companies that transport our goods. The market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source. The global supply and demand for recycled fiber may be affected by factors such as trade policies between countries, individual governments' legislation and\nregulations, and changes in the global economy. In addition, the increase in demand of products manufactured, in whole or in part, from recycled fiber, on a global basis, may cause significant fluctuations in recycled fiber prices. Energy prices, in particular prices for oil and natural gas, have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future. The availability of labor and the market price for fuel may affect our costs for third-party transportation. We have recently experienced, and may continue to experience, a significant increase in various costs, including recycled fiber, energy, freight and other supply chain costs. In addition, because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments, we may not be able to recoup past or future increases in the costs of any raw materials, energy sources or transportation sources through price increases to our customers. Our profitability has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials, energy sources and transportation sources.\nFLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICES OF AND THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS DUE TO FACTORS SUCH AS ECONOMIC CYCLICALITY AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions. The length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product. In addition, changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiber-based products and non-fiber substitutes. Moreover, consumer preferences are constantly changing based on, among other factors, cost, convenience and health, environmental and social concerns and perceptions. These consumer preferences may affect the prices of our products. Consequently, our financial results are sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products. In addition, our results may be adversely affected if we fail to anticipate trends that would enable us to offer products that respond to changing customer preferences and technological and regulatory developments.\nCOMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. We operate in a competitive environment, both in the United States and internationally, in all of our operating segments. Our products compete with similar products produced by other forest products companies. Product innovations, manufacturing and operating efficiencies, additional manufacturing capacity, marketing, distribution and pricing strategies pursued or\nachieved by competitors, and the entry of new competitors in to the markets we serve could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, our products also compete, in some instances, with companies in other industries that produce substitutes for wood-fiber products, such as plastics and various types of metal, and customer shifts away from wood-fiber products toward such substitute products may adversely affect our business.\nRISKS RELATING TO MARKET AND ECONOMIC FACTORS, ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN GENERAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. General economic conditions may adversely affect industrial non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar employment levels and consumer confidence, all of which impact demand for our products, or otherwise adversely affect our business. We may also be adversely affected by catastrophic or other unforeseen events, including future health epidemics or pandemics, natural disasters, geopolitical events, terrorism, political, financial or social instability, or civil or social unrest. Moreover, negative economic conditions or other adverse developments with respect to our business have resulted in, and may in the future result in impairment charges which could be material. Volatility or uncertainty in the financial, capital and credit markets, which impacts interest rates, currency exchange rates and the availability of credit, could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations.\nCHANGES IN INTERNATIONAL CONDITIONS OR OTHER RISKS ARISING FROM CONDUCTING BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the United States in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products. These risks, which can vary substantially by country, may include economic or political instability, geopolitical events (such as increasing tensions between Ukraine and Russia), corruption, anti-American sentiment, social and ethnic unrest, the regulatory environment (including the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of legal requirements), fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the U.S. dollar, repatriating cash from foreign countries to the United States, downturns or changes in economic activity (including in relation to commodity inflation), adverse tax consequences or\nrulings, nationalization or any change in social, political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions impacting matters such as sustainability, environmental regulations and trade policies and agreements, could negatively affect our financial results. Trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products, including governmental subsidies, tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over International Paper, may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries. Likewise, disruption in existing trade agreements or increased trade friction between countries (such as in relation to the trade tensions between the United States and China), which can result in tariffs, could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations by restricting the free flow of goods and services across borders.\nIn addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under U.S. law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad, and the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control and other non-U.S. government entities maintain economic sanctions targeting various countries, persons and entities. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations.\nTHE LEVEL OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. As of December 31, 2021, International Paper had approximately $5.6 billion of outstanding indebtedness. The level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition, operating results and business, including the following:\n\u2022it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, dividends, share repurchases, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022a portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to payments on indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including operations, capital\nexpenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022the debt service requirements of our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy other obligations;\n\u2022it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions, including to react to rising interest rates, and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022it may increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, and may make us unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth.\nIn addition, we are subject to agreements governing our indebtedness that require us to meet and maintain certain financial ratios and covenants. A significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions, or other significant adverse developments with respect to our results of operations or financial condition, may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives. Moreover, the restrictions associated with these financial ratios and covenants may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. Additionally, despite these restrictions, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility and otherwise increase the risks associated with our indebtedness as noted above.\nMoreover, certain of our variable rate debt uses the London Interbank Offering Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. In March 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021 for sterling, euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen settings, as well as the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar settings, and immediately after June 30, 2023 for the remaining U.S. dollar settings. In instances where we have not yet incorporated LIBOR-replacement provisions into our variable rate debt provisions that use LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark, we will need to do so before June 30, 2023. The discontinuation and replacement of LIBOR\nor any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets. Additionally, uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation and replacement, including that any benchmark may not be the economic equivalent of LIBOR or not achieve market acceptance similar to LIBOR, may negatively impact the cost of our variable rate debt.\nCHANGES IN CREDIT RATINGS ISSUED BY NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STATISTICAL RATING ORGANIZATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FINANCING AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES. Maintaining an investment-grade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy, and a downgrade of the Company\u2019s ratings below investment grade will likely eliminate our ability to access the commercial paper market, may limit our access to the capital markets, have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position. The Company\u2019s desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the Company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow, including sale of assets, suspension or reduction of our dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital.\nUnder the terms of the agreements governing approximately $1.0 billion of our debt as of December 31, 2021, the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade. As a result, a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade may lead to an increase in our interest expense. There can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances so warrant. Any such downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing, limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur.\nDOWNGRADES IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF BANKS ISSUING CERTAIN LETTERS OF CREDIT WILL INCREASE OUR COST OF MAINTAINING CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS AND MAY RESULT IN THE ACCELERATION OF DEFERRED TAXES. We are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes, including those delivered to Temple-Inland in connection with Temple-Inland's\n2007 sales of forestlands, may be downgraded below a required rating. Since 2007, certain banks have fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced, or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement. As a result of continuing uncertainty in the banking environment, a number of the letter-of-credit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited. The downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject the Company to additional costs of securing a replacement letter-of-credit bank or could result in an acceleration of payments of up to $487 million in deferred income taxes if replacement banks cannot be obtained. The deferred taxes are currently recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements. See Note 15, Variable Interest Entities, on pages 74 through 75, and Note 13. Income Taxes, on pages 68 through 70, in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information.\nOUR PENSION AND HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS FACTORS WHICH COULD CAUSE THESE COSTS TO CHANGE. We have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all U.S. salaried employees hired prior to July 1, 2004 (or later for certain acquired populations, as described in Note 19. Retirement Plans, on pages 80 through 86, in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) and substantially all hourly union and non-union employees regardless of hire date. The Company froze participation under these plans for U.S. salaried employees, including credited service and compensation on or after January 1, 2019; however, the pension freeze does not affect benefits accrued through December 31, 2018. We provide retiree health care benefits to certain former U.S. employees, as well as financial assistance towards the cost of individual retiree medical coverage for certain former U.S. salaried employees. Our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual market returns on plan assets, changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may impact pension costs in future periods. Likewise, changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could increase pension costs. However, the impact of market fluctuations has been reduced as a result of investments in our pension plan asset portfolio which partially hedge the impact of changes In interest rates on the plan\u2019s funded status. Drivers for fluctuating health costs include unit cost changes, health care utilization by participants, and potential changes in legal requirements and government oversight.\nOUR U.S. FUNDED PENSION PLANS ARE CURRENTLY FULLY FUNDED ON A PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION BASIS; HOWEVER, THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT OVER TIME WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE CASH PAYMENTS TO THE PLANS, REDUCING THE CASH AVAILABLE FOR OUR BUSINESS. We record an asset or a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the surplus of the fair value of plan assets above the benefit obligation or the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets. At December 31, 2021, we had an overfunded pension asset balance. The benefit surplus recorded under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 715, \u201cCompensation - Retirement Benefits,\u201d at December 31, 2021 was $242 million. The amount and timing of future contributions, which could be material, will depend upon a number of factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS\nMATERIAL DISRUPTIONS AT ONE OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. We operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities. A material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and/or negatively impact our financial condition. Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:\n\u2022fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes (including adverse weather conditions which may be intensified by climate change);\n\u2022the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply;\n\u2022the effect of other severe weather conditions on equipment and facilities;\n\u2022disruption in the supply of raw materials or other manufacturing inputs;\n\u2022terrorism or threats of terrorism;\n\u2022information system disruptions or failures due to any number of causes, including cyber-attacks;\n\u2022domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to our Company and our business partners, including joint venture partners, around the world;\n\u2022unscheduled maintenance outages;\n\u2022prolonged power failures;\n\u2022an equipment failure;\n\u2022a chemical spill or release;\n\u2022explosion of a boiler or other equipment;\n\u2022damage or disruptions caused by third parties operating on or adjacent to one of our manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels;\n\u2022a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, such as the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, or any other public health crisis;\n\u2022failure of our third party service providers and business partners to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with agreed upon terms;\n\u2022labor difficulties; and\n\u2022other operational problems.\nAny such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and/or require us to make unplanned expenditures. If one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results.\nCERTAIN OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED BY JOINT VENTURES THAT WE CANNOT OPERATE SOLELY FOR OUR BENEFIT. We have a 50% equity interest in Ilim S.A., whose primary operations are in Russia. In joint ventures, such as the Ilim joint venture, we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do. In general, joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and\nmaking decisions. In joint ventures, we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our co-owners as well as with the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes, our relationship may be adversely affected. In addition, the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, so we receive only our portion of those benefits.\nWE MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES, DIVESTITURES, SPIN-OFFS, CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND OTHER CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS THAT WE HAVE PURSUED OR MAY PURSUE. Our strategy for long-term growth, productivity and profitability depends, in part, on our ability to accomplish prudent acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, spin-offs, capital investments and other corporate transactions that we may pursue and to realize the benefits we expect from such transactions. We are subject to the risk that we may not achieve the expected benefits from such transactions. This failure could require us to record an impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets, which could lead to decreased assets and reduced net earnings. Among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities or access to new markets (or a combination thereof), and in the case of divestitures, the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers who place higher strategic value on such businesses and assets than we do.\nCorporate transactions of this nature which we may pursue involve a number of special risks, including with respect to our inability to realize our business goals with respect to such transactions as noted above, the focus of our management\u2019s attention on these transactions and the assimilation of acquired businesses into our operations, the demands on our financial, operational and information technology systems resulting from acquired businesses, and the possibility that we may become responsible for substantial contingent or unanticipated legal liabilities as the result of acquisitions or other corporate transactions.\nWe believe that the spin-off of Sylvamo Corporation allows us and Sylvamo Corporation to pursue distinct strategies appropriate to our respective markets. However, there can be no assurance that we will realize any or all of the expected strategic, financial, operational or other benefits of the spin-off. A failure to realize expected benefits of the spin-off could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe cannot guarantee that Sylvamo Corporation will be successful as a standalone entity. In the event that Sylvamo Corporation is not successful, it is possible that plaintiffs could assert a variety of claims against us. Depending on their nature and number, such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we account for certain investments, including our investment in Sylvamo Corporation, on a mark-to-market basis and, as a result, changes in the fair value of these investments could significantly impact our reported results.\nWE COULD BE EXPOSED TO CLAIMS FROM SYLVAMO CORPORATION UNDER OUR AGREEMENTS WITH SYLVAMO CORPORATION OR OTHERWISE. We have entered into agreements with Sylvamo Corporation and its subsidiaries, including among others a separation and distribution agreement, registration rights agreement, transition services agreement, tax matters agreement, supply and offtake agreements, intellectual property agreements and other commercial arrangements. Our agreements with Sylvamo Corporation or its subsidiaries may not reflect terms that would have resulted from negotiations between unaffiliated parties and, in certain instances, may relate to the continuation of certain business arrangements among us and Sylvamo Corporation in existence prior to the spin-off. Such agreements include, among other things, the parties\u2019 respective indemnification rights and obligations with respect to certain losses relating to specified liabilities as well as certain losses relating to specified information included in certain securities filings, the allocations of assets and liabilities, payment obligations and other obligations between us and Sylvamo Corporation. There can be no assurance that any remedies available under these arrangements will be sufficient to compensate us in the event of a dispute or non-performance. In addition, there can be no assurance that the attention we must pay, and resources we must devote, to our obligations under one or more of these agreements, or the results of any failure to perform those obligations, or successful claim by Sylvamo Corporation that we have failed to perform those obligations or have an indemnification obligation under these agreements, will not have a material impact on our own business performance, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe will rely on Sylvamo Corporation to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements entered into in connection with the spin-off. If Sylvamo Corporation fails to satisfy such obligations it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, under the tax matters agreement, we could have significant payment obligations in connection with certain Brazilian tax matters. Under this agreement, we have agreed to pay 60% of the first $300 million of any liability resulting from the resolution of these Brazilian tax matters (with Sylvamo paying the remaining 40% of any such liability) and 100% of any liability resulting from the Brazilian tax matters over $300 million. The assessments for the tax years 2007 - 2015 currently total approximately $106 million in tax and $351 million in interest, penalties and fees as of December 31, 2021 (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates). See Note 14 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities on pages 70 through 74 of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information.\nWE OPERATE IN A CHALLENGING MARKET FOR TALENT AND MAY FAIL TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, INCLUDING KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL. Our ability to operate and grow our business depends on our ability to attract and retain employees with the skills necessary to operate and maintain our facilities, produce our products and serve our customers. The market for both hourly workers and professional workers has been, and remains, very competitive, particularly for employees with specialized technical and trade experience. For example, due to labor market constraints, we have recently had to increase overtime while we try to hire additional permanent employees. This, along with the current competitive labor market, has led to higher labor costs, particularly at our converting facilities. Moreover, despite our focused efforts to attract and retain employees, including by offering higher levels of compensation in certain instances, we experienced attrition rates within our workforce in 2021 that exceeded historical levels. In addition, we rely on key executive and management personnel to manage our business efficiently and effectively. The loss of key executive and management employees, particularly in a challenging market for attracting and retaining employees, could adversely affect our business.\nMoreover, changing demographics and labor work force trends, including remote work expectations for many individuals arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, may make it difficult for us to replace retiring or departing employees. If we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel, or if we continue to experience excessive turnover, we may continue to experience higher labor costs and labor shortages, and our business may be adversely impacted. Moreover, labor shortages may be further exacerbated by COVID-19 vaccination and testing requirements.\nIn addition, a significant number of our employees are represented by unions. We may not be able to successfully negotiate new union contracts once our current contracts with unions expire without work stoppages or labor difficulties, or we may be unable renegotiate such contracts on favorable terms. We have also experienced work stoppages in the past and may experience them in the future. Moreover, labor organizations may attempt to organize groups of additional employees from time to time, and potential changes in labor laws could make it easier for them to do so. If we experience any extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities as a result of strikes or other work stoppages or if unions are able to organize additional groups of our employees, our operating costs increase and our operational flexibility could be reduced.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO CYBERSECURITY AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RISKS RELATED TO BREACHES OF SECURITY PERTAINING TO SENSITIVE COMPANY, CUSTOMER, EMPLOYEE AND VENDOR INFORMATION AS WELL AS BREACHES IN THE TECHNOLOGY USED TO MANAGE OPERATIONS AND OTHER BUSINESS PROCESSES. Our business operations rely upon securely managed information technology systems for data capture, processing, storage and reporting. We have invested in information technology security initiatives and information technology risk management, as well as business continuity and disaster recovery plans. The development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring, testing and updating as technologies and processes change, and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated.\nThe current cyber threat environment presents increased risk for all companies, including those in our industry. Like other global companies, our systems are subject to recurring attempts by third parties to access information, manipulate data or disrupt our operations, and we have experienced cyber threats and incidents, although none have been material or had a material adverse effect on our business. Despite careful security and controls design, implementation, updating and independent third party verification, our information technology systems, and those of our third party providers or joint venture partners, could become subject to employee error or malfeasance, cyber-attacks, such as ransomware and data theft, by common hackers, criminal groups or nation-state organizations or social activist (\"hacktivist\") organizations, geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks or other catastrophic events. In addition, the cybersecurity-related threats that we face may remain undetected for an extended\nperiod of time. Network, system, application and data breaches, and other cybersecurity incidents, could result in operational disruptions, data loss or manipulation, or information misappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption to systems availability, denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with the Company. Access to applications required to plan our operations, source materials, manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused. Theft of intellectual property or trade secrets, and loss or inappropriate disclosure of confidential company, employee, customer or vendor information, could stem from such incidents. While we have significant security processes and initiatives in place, we may be unable to detect or prevent a breach or disruption. Any significant cybersecurity incident or operational disruptions and/or misappropriation of information could result in lost sales, business delays, negative publicity, cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns, and have a material effect on our business. Additionally, while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks in place, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in connection with such incidents.\nRISKS RELATING TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND COMPLIANCE COSTS\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO A WIDE VARIETY OF LAWS, REGULATIONS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY CHANGE IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS, AND THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH REQUIREMENTS COULD IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Our operations are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and other government requirements -- including, among others, those relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment, data privacy, tax, trade and health care. There can be no assurance that laws, regulations and government requirements will not be changed, applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our operations and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, or subjecting us to increased costs.\nFor example, as part of our business, we are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and international laws governing the protection of the environment. We have incurred significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations. In addition, new environmental laws, regulations or\nother requirements, including with respect to GHG emissions or climate change, may cause us to incur increased and unexpected compliance costs. Moreover, there has historically been a lack of consistent climate legislation, which has created and continues to create economic and regulatory uncertainty. Our environmental expenditures include, among other areas, those related to air and water quality, waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater, including situations where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party. Moreover, we may be directly impacted by, and are working to manage, the risks and costs to us, our customers and our vendors of the effects of climate change, GHGs, and the availability of energy and water resources. These risks include the potentially adverse impact on forestlands, which are a key resource in the production of our products, increased product costs and a change in the types of products that customers purchase. There can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements will not require significant expenditures, or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs. We could also incur substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures), natural resource damages claims, cleanup and closure costs, third-party claims for property damage and personal injury and reputational harm as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws, regulations, codes and common law. The amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and, in some cases, liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of hazardous substances.\nOur global operations subject us to complex and evolving U.S and international data privacy laws and regulations, such as European\u2019s Union General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d) and the California Privacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\"), and China\u2019s Personal Information Protection Law (\u201cPIPL\u201d) which came into effect as of November 1, 2021. These laws require the Company to comply with a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. There are significant penalties for non-compliance including monetary fines, disruption of operations and reputational harm. Moreover, other states and governmental authorities around the world have introduced or passed, or are consider enacting, similar legislation which may impose varying standards and requirements on our data collection, use and processing activities.\nThis increasingly restrictive and evolving regulatory environment at the international, federal and state level related to data privacy and data protection may require changes to our business practices and give rise to significantly expanded compliance burdens, costs and enforcement risks. Moreover, many of these laws and regulations are subject to uncertain application, interpretation or enforcement standards that could result in claims, changes to our business practices, data processing and security systems, penalties, increased operating costs or other impacts on our businesses. These laws often provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as private rights of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. The Company proactively uses internal and external resources to monitor compliance with relevant legislation and continually evaluates and, where necessary, modifies its data processing practices and policies in order to comply with evolving privacy laws. Nevertheless, relevant regulatory authorities could determine that our data handling practices fail to address all the requirements of certain new laws, which could subject us to penalties and/or litigation. In addition, there is no assurance that our security controls over personal data, the training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security, and the policies, procedures and practices we implemented or may implement in the future will prevent the improper handling of, disclosure of or access to personal data. Improper handling and disclosure of or access to personal data in violation of the GDPR, PIPL, the CCPA and/or of other data privacy and protection laws could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, subject us to government enforcement actions (including fines), or result in private litigation against us, which could result in loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, all of which could negatively affect our business and operating results.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, and changes in laws, regulation or interpretation of existing laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation, could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, the application of tax law is subject to interpretation and is subject to audit by taxing authorities. Additionally, administrative guidance can be incomplete or vary from legislative intent, and therefore the application of the tax law is uncertain. While we believe the positions reported by the Company comply with relevant tax laws and regulations, taxing authorities could interpret our application of certain laws and regulations differently.\nWe are currently subject to tax audits in the U.S. and other taxing jurisdictions around the world. In some\ncases, we have appealed and may continue to appeal, assessments by taxing authorities in the court system. As such, tax controversy matters may result in previously unrecorded tax expenses, accelerated cash tax payments, higher future tax expenses, or the assessment of interest and penalties. For example, the 2015 timber monetization restructuring is currently under Internal Revenue Service examination. An unfavorable resolution in such current examination, future administrative procedures, or future tax litigation could result in material, accelerated cash tax payments as a result of all or a portion of the remaining $813 million deferred tax liability relating to the timber monetization becoming payable. See Note 15 Variable Interest Entities for more detail on the timber monetization and the 2015 restructuring.\nAs such, tax controversy matters may result in previously unrecorded tax expenses, higher future tax expenses or the assessment of interest and penalties.\nRESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS. We are a party to various legal, regulatory and governmental proceedings and other related matters, including with respect to environmental matters. In addition, we are and may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events, circumstances and occurrences. Should an unfavorable outcome occur in connection with our legal, regulatory or governmental proceedings or other loss contingencies, or if we become subject to any such loss contingencies in the future, there could be a material adverse impact on our financial results. See Note 14 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities on pages 70 through 74 of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information.\nIF THE SPIN-OFF OF SYLVAMO CORPORATION WERE TO FAIL TO QUALIFY FOR NON-RECOGNITION TREATMENT FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, THEN INTERNATIONAL PAPER AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS MAY BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. The Company received an opinion of tax counsel and a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) regarding the qualification of the spin-off of Sylvamo Corporation and certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally tax-free to Sylvamo Corporation, the Company and the shareholders of the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A tax opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. In addition, the\nCompany\u2019s tax counsel and the IRS relied on certain representations and covenants delivered by the Company and Sylvamo Corporation in rendering such opinion and private letter ruling. If any of the representations or covenants relied upon for the tax opinion or private letter ruling become inaccurate, incomplete or not complied with by the Company, Sylvamo Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries, the tax opinion may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.\nIf the IRS ultimately determines that the spin-off is taxable, then the spin-off could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to the Company\u2019s shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the Company could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. These income tax liabilities may be indemnifiable by Sylvamo Corporation pursuant to a tax matters agreement between the Company and Sylvamo. However, there can be no assurance that Sylvamo would have the resources or liquidity required to indemnify the Company for any such tax liability.\nEven if the spin-off otherwise qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss under Section 355 of the Code, the spin-off may be taxable to the Company (but not the shareholders of the Company) pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code if there is a 50% or more (by vote or value) change in ownership of either the Company or Sylvamo Corporation, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spin-off. For this purpose, any acquisitions of the Company\u2019s or Sylvamo Corporation\u2019s common stock within two years before or after the spin-off are presumed to be part of such a plan, although the Company or Sylvamo Corporation may be able to rebut that presumption based on either applicable facts and circumstances or a \u201csafe harbor\u201d described in the U.S. tax regulations.", "PERMNO": 21573, "SIC": 2631, "TIC": "IP"}
