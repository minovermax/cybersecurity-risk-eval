Because negotiated sales contracts and the market largely determine the pricing for its products, the Company is at times limited in its ability to raise prices and pass through to its customers any inflationary or other cost increases that the Company may incur.\nThe Company uses productivity improvements to reduce costs and offset inflation. These include global continuous improvement initiatives that use statistical process control to help design and manage many types of activities, including production and maintenance. The Company's ability to realize anticipated savings from these improvements is subject to significant operational, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company's control. If the Company cannot successfully implement cost savings plans, it may not be able to continue to compete successfully against other manufacturers. In addition, any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect the Company's financial results.\nChanges in consumer buying habits and preferences for products could have an effect on our sales volumes.\nChanging consumer dietary habits and preferences have slowed sales growth for many of the food and beverage products the Company packages. If these trends continue the Company\u2019s financial results could be adversely affected.\nCompetition and product substitution could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial results.\nThe Company competes with other paperboard manufacturers and carton converters, both domestically and internationally. The Company's products compete with those made from other manufacturers' CUK board, as well as SBS and CRB, and other board substrates. Substitute products include plastic, shrink film and corrugated containers. In addition, while the Company has long-term relationships with many of its customers, the underlying contracts may be re-bid or renegotiated from time to time, and the Company may not be successful in renewing such contracts on favorable terms or at all. The Company works to maintain market share through efficiency, product innovations and strategic sourcing to its customers; however, pricing and other competitive pressures may occasionally result in the loss of a customer relationship.\nThe Company's future growth and financial results could be adversely impacted if the Company is unable to identify strategic acquisitions and to successfully integrate the acquired businesses.\nThe Company has made several acquisitions in recent years. The Company's ability to continue to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate the acquired businesses successfully, including obtaining anticipated cost savings or synergies and expected operating results within a reasonable period of time, is an important factor in the Company's future growth. If the Company is unable to realize the expected revenue and cash flow growth and other benefits, the Company may be required to spend additional time or money on integration efforts that would otherwise have been spent on the development and expansion of its business.\nThe Company may not be able to develop and introduce new products and adequately protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights, which could harm its future success and competitive position.\nThe Company works to increase market share and profitability through product innovation and the introduction of new products. The inability to develop new or better products in a timely manner may impact the Company's competitive position.\nThe Company's future success and competitive position also depends, in part, upon its ability to obtain and maintain protection for certain proprietary carton and packaging machine technologies used in its value-added products, particularly those incorporating the Fridge Vendor, IntegraPak, MicroFlex-Q, MicroRite, Quilt Wave, Qwik Crisp, Tite-Pak, and Z-Flute technologies. Failure to protect the Company's existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable technologies or may require it to license other companies' intellectual property rights. It is possible that any of the patents owned by the Company may be invalidated, rendered unenforceable, circumvented, challenged or licensed to others or any of its pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by the Company, if at all. Further, others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to the Company's technologies, duplicate its technologies or design around its patents, and steps taken by the Company to protect its technologies may not prevent misappropriation of such technologies.\nThe Company could experience material disruptions at our facilities.\nAlthough the Company takes appropriate measures to minimize the risk and effect of material disruptions to the business conducted at our facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and fires, as well as other unexpected disruptions such as the unavailability of critical raw materials, power outages and equipment failures can reduce production and increase manufacturing costs. These types of disruptions could materially adversely affect our earnings, depending upon the duration of the disruption and our ability to shift business to other facilities or find other sources of materials or energy. Any losses due to these events may not be covered by our existing insurance policies or may be subject to certain deductibles.\nThe Company is subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries.\nThe Company has 13 converting plants in 8 foreign countries and sells its products worldwide. For 2014, before intercompany eliminations, net sales from operations outside of the U.S. represented approximately 18% of the Company\u2019s net sales. The Company\u2019s revenues from foreign sales fluctuate with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company pursues a currency hedging program in order to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on financial results. At December 31, 2014, approximately 27% of its total assets were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nThe Company is also subject to the following significant risks associated with operating in foreign countries:\n\u2022\nCompliance with and enforcement of environmental, health and safety and labor laws and other regulations of the foreign countries in which the Company operates;\n\u2022\nExport compliance;\n\u2022\nImposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nImposition of new or increases in investment and other requirements by foreign governments.\nThe Company is subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and costs to comply with such laws and regulations, or any liability or obligation imposed under new laws or regulations, could negatively impact its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to a broad range of foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing discharges to air, soil and water, the management, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, the investigation and remediation of contamination resulting from releases of hazardous substances, and the health and safety of employees. The Company cannot currently assess the impact that future emission standards, climate control initiatives and enforcement practices will have on the Company's operations and capital expenditure requirements. Environmental liabilities and obligations may result in significant costs, which could negatively impact the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein under \u201cItem 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nThe Company's indebtedness may adversely affect its financial condition and its ability to react to changes in its business.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had an aggregate principal amount of $1,974.3 million of outstanding debt. Because of the Company's debt level, a portion of its cash flows from operations will be dedicated to payments on indebtedness and the\nCompany's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be restricted in the future.\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated October 1, 2014 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) and the indentures governing its 4.75% Senior Notes due 2021 and the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2022 (the \u201cIndentures\u201d) prohibit or restrict, among other things, the disposal of assets, the incurrence of additional indebtedness (including guarantees), payment of dividends, share repurchases, loans or advances and certain other types of transactions. These restrictions could limit the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing market conditions and competitive pressures. The debt obligations and restrictions may also leave the Company more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions or its business, or unable to carry out capital expenditures that are necessary or important to its growth strategy and productivity improvement programs.\nApproximately 37% of the Company\u2019s debt is subject to variable rates of interest and exposes the Company to increased debt service obligations in the event of increased interest rates.\nThe Company's pension plans are currently underfunded, and the Company may be required to make cash payments to the plans, reducing the cash available for its business.\nThe Company's cash flows may be adversely impacted by the Company's pension funding obligations. The Company's pension funding obligations are dependent upon multiple factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. The Company has unfunded obligations of $273.9 million under its domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans. The funded status of these plans is dependent upon various factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rate used to determine the pension obligations. Unfavorable returns on the plan assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which would reduce the cash available to the Company for other purposes.", "PERMNO": 89810, "SIC": 2650, "TIC": "GPK"}
