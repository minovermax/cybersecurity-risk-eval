{"cik": "1642453", "company": "Daseke, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisk Factors\nThe following are the material risk factors that apply to an investment in the Company. These risk factors are not exhaustive, and the Company may face additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to it, or that the Company currently deems immaterial, which may also impair its business or results of operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, the Company\u2019s business or results of operations could be materially harmed, the Company\u2019s ability to implement its business plans could be impaired and the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline.\nRisks Relating to the Company\u2019s Industry\nThe Company\u2019s industry is affected by general economic and business risks that are largely beyond its control.\nThe Company\u2019s industry is highly cyclical, and its business is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are beyond its control. Some of the most significant of these factors are economic changes that affect supply and demand in transportation markets in general, such as downturns in customers\u2019 business cycles and recessionary economic cycles; changes in customers\u2019 inventory levels and in the availability of funding for their working capital; commercial driver shortages and increases in driver compensation; and excess tractor capacity in comparison with shipping demand. The risks associated with these factors are heightened when the U.S. and/or global economy is weakened. Some of the principal risks during such times are as follows:\n\u25cf the Company may experience low overall freight levels, which may impair its asset utilization, because its customers\u2019 demand for its services generally correlate with the strength of the United States and, to a lesser extent, global economy;\n\u25cf certain of the Company\u2019s customers may face credit issues and cash flow problems that affect their ability to pay for the Company\u2019s services;\n\u25cf certain of the Company\u2019s suppliers\u2019 business levels may be negatively affected, leading to disruptions in the supply and availability, or increased cost, of equipment, parts and services that are critical to the Company\u2019s operations;\n\u25cf freight patterns may change as supply chains are redesigned, resulting in an imbalance between the Company\u2019s capacity and its customers\u2019 demands; and\n\u25cf customers may bid out freight or select competitors that offer lower rates from among existing choices in an attempt to lower their costs, causing the Company to lower its rates or lose freight.\nThe Company also is subject to cost increases outside of its control that could materially reduce its profitability if it is unable to increase its rates sufficiently. Such cost increases include increases in fuel prices, driver wages, owner-operator contracted rates, insurance, interest rates, taxes, tolls, license and registration fees, revenue equipment and healthcare for its employees.\nIn addition, events outside the Company\u2019s control, including global and national heath epidemics or concerns (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), strikes or other work stoppages at its facilities or at customer, port, border or other shipping locations (including as a result of such epidemics or concerns or otherwise), or actual or threatened armed conflicts or terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, military action against a foreign state or group located in a foreign state, or heightened security requirements, could lead to reduced economic demand and activity, reduced availability of credit or temporary closing of the shipping locations or United States borders. Such events may reduce the demand for the Company\u2019s services and could impair the Company\u2019s operating efficiency and productivity, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and its business, results of operations and prospects may suffer if it is unable to adequately address downward pricing and other competitive pressures.\nThe Company competes with many open-deck carriers of varying sizes, including some that may have greater access to equipment, a wider range of services, greater capital resources, less indebtedness or other competitive advantages and including smaller, regional service providers that cover specific shipping lanes with specific customers or that offer niche services. The Company also competes, to a lesser extent, with some less-than-truckload carriers, railroads, and third-party logistics, brokerage, freight forwarding and other transportation companies. Numerous competitive factors, including the following, could impair the Company\u2019s ability to maintain or improve its profitability:\n\u25cf many of the Company\u2019s competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth or a downturn in the economy, which may limit the Company\u2019s ability to maintain or increase freight rates, may require the Company to reduce its freight rates or may limit its ability to maintain or expand its business;\n\u25cf some shippers have reduced or may reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting core carriers as approved service providers and in some instances the Company may not be selected;\n\u25cf many customers periodically solicit bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, which may depress freight rates or result in a loss of business to competitors;\n\u25cf the continuing trend toward consolidation in the trucking industry may result in more large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages, and the Company may have difficulty competing with them;\n\u25cf advances in technology may require the Company to increase investments in order to remain competitive, and its customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments;\n\u25cf higher fuel prices and, in turn, higher fuel surcharges to the Company\u2019s customers may cause some of its customers to consider freight transportation alternatives, including rail transportation;\n\u25cf the Company may have higher exposure to litigation risks as compared to smaller carriers; and\n\u25cf smaller carriers may build economies of scale with procurement aggregation providers, which may improve the smaller carriers\u2019 abilities to compete with the Company.\nRisks Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and various governmental actions taken to mitigate its impact, have affected and may materially adversely affect, and any future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious diseases may materially adversely affect, our operations, financial performance and condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and various governmental actions taken to mitigate its impact, has affected, and may materially adversely affect, our operations, financial performance and condition, operating results and cash flows. The severity, magnitude and duration of the current COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, rapidly changing and hard to predict. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world, and COVID-19 or another similar outbreak could negatively impact our business in numerous ways, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf our revenue has been reduced and may continue to be reduced to the extent the pandemic results in an economic downturn or recession, as many experts predict, which leads to a decrease in demand for our services or the transportation markets in general;\n\u25cf our operations may be disrupted or impaired, if a significant portion of our drivers or other employees are unable to work due to illness;\n\u25cf the pandemic has increased volatility and caused negative pressure in the capital markets; as a result, we may experience difficulty accessing the capital or financing needed to fund our operations, which have substantial capital requirements, on satisfactory terms or at all;\n\u25cf we may experience liquidity challenges, including impacts related to delayed customer payments and payment defaults associated with customer liquidity issues and bankruptcies;\n\u25cf customers, suppliers and other third parties may argue that their non-performance under our contracts with them is permitted as a result of force majeure or other reasons;\n\u25cf we may experience workforce rightsizing-related issues and incur severance payments as a result of adjusting our workforce to market conditions, and we may subsequently experience retention issues and driver shortages when market conditions improve;\n\u25cf our management may be distracted as they are focused on mitigating the effects of COVID-19 on our operations while protecting the health of our workforce and customers, which has required, and will continue to require, a large investment of time and resources; and\n\u25cf we may be at greater risk for cybersecurity issues, as digital technologies may become more vulnerable and experience a higher rate of cyberattacks in the current environment of remote connectivity.\nThe rapid development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the Company will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict, including: the severity and duration of the pandemic; governmental, business and other actions in response to the pandemic (which could include limitations on the Company\u2019s operations or mandates to provide services in a specified manner); the impact of the pandemic on economic activity; the response of the overall economy and the financial markets; the extent and duration of the effect on consumer confidence and spending; the health of and the effect on our workforce and our ability to meet staffing needs; any impairment in the value of our tangible or intangible assets which could be\nrecorded as a result of a weaker economic conditions; and the potential effects on our internal controls, including those over financial reporting, as a result of changes in working environments, such as shelter-in-place and similar orders that are applicable to our employees and business partners, among others.\nGeneral Commercial and Operational Risks\nInsurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce the Company\u2019s profitability, and underwriters leaving the marketplace may make it more difficult for the Company to obtain insurance at favorable prices or at all.\nThe Company is exposed to claims and rising insurance premiums related to, among others, auto liability, general liability, directors and officers liability, errors and omissions liability, liability related to cybersecurity attacks, cargo loss and damage, property damage, personal injury, workers\u2019 compensation, group health, group dental and general umbrella policies. The Company has insurance coverage with third-party insurance carriers, but it assumes a significant portion of the risk associated with these claims due to its self-insured retention (SIR) and deductibles, which can make its insurance and claims expense higher or more volatile. The Company is subject to changing conditions and pricing in the insurance marketplace, including as a result of carriers or underwriters leaving the transportation sector and the increasing frequency and size of auto liability lawsuits, and the cost or availability of various types of insurance may change dramatically in the future, particularly if its claims experience deteriorates. Insurance carriers have and may continue to increase premiums for transportation companies generally (especially in regards to auto liability). If the Company\u2019s insurance or claims expense increases, and the Company is unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates, its results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The Company\u2019s results of operations may also be materially and adversely affected if it experiences a claim in excess of its coverage limits, a claim for which coverage is not provided or a claim that is covered but its insurance company fails to perform.\nSeasonality and the impact of weather and other catastrophic events adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are affected by the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations and some shippers reduce their shipments during winter. At the same time, operating expenses increase due to, among other things, a decline in fuel efficiency because of engine idling and harsh weather that creates higher accident frequency, increased claims and higher equipment repair expenditures. These weather-related and other catastrophic events, such as fires, earthquakes and explosions, may also disrupt fuel supplies, increase fuel costs, disrupt freight shipments or routes, affect regional economies, destroy the Company\u2019s assets or the assets of its customers or otherwise adversely affect the business or financial condition of its customers, any of which developments could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability or make its results more volatile. Climate change may increase the severity of weather-related events, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms or floods.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the price or availability of diesel fuel.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are dependent upon diesel fuel, and diesel fuel is one of the Company\u2019s largest operating expenses. Diesel fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as political events, price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels, terrorist activities, environmental laws and regulations, armed conflicts, depreciation of the dollar against other currencies, world supply and demand imbalances, imposition of tariffs, and hurricanes and other natural or man-made disasters. Such events may also lead to fuel shortages and disruptions in the fuel supply chain. Increases in fuel costs may have a significant adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability. The Company has not used derivatives as a hedge against higher fuel costs in the past. Although the Company maintains a fuel surcharge program, there can be no assurance that the program will be maintained indefinitely or will be sufficiently effective. The Company incurs certain fuel costs that cannot be recovered even with respect to customers with which it maintains fuel surcharge programs and even if it is able to increase rates per miles, such as fuel costs associated with empty miles. Because the Company\u2019s fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices, its fuel surcharge recovery may not capture in any particular period the increased costs it pays for fuel. Further, during periods of low freight volumes, shippers can use their negotiating leverage to impose less compensatory fuel surcharge policies.\nIncreased prices for, or decreases in the availability of, new revenue equipment and decreases in the value of used revenue equipment could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nInvestment in new equipment is a significant part of the Company\u2019s annual capital expenditures, and the Company requires an available supply of tractors and trailers from equipment manufacturers to operate and grow its business. In recent years, manufacturers have raised the prices of new revenue equipment significantly due to increased costs of materials and, in part, to offset their costs of\ncompliance with new tractor engine and emission system design requirements mandated by the EPA and various state agencies, which are intended to reduce emissions. If new equipment prices increase more than anticipated, the Company could incur higher depreciation and rental expenses than anticipated. If the Company is unable to fully offset any such increases in expenses with freight rate increases and/or improved fuel economy, its results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe Company may face difficulty in purchasing an adequate supply of new equipment due to decreased supply. From time to time, some original equipment manufacturers (OEM) of tractors and trailers may reduce their manufacturing output due to lower demand for their products in economic downturns or a shortage of component parts. Uncertainty as to future emission standards may also serve to decrease such manufacturing output.\nDuring prolonged periods of decreased tonnage levels, the Company and other trucking companies may make strategic fleet reductions, which could result in an increase in the supply of used equipment. When the supply exceeds the demand for used revenue equipment, the general market value of used revenue equipment decreases. Used equipment prices are also subject to substantial fluctuations based on availability of financing and commodity prices for scrap metal. A depressed market for used equipment could require the Company to trade its revenue equipment at depressed values or to record losses on disposal or an impairment of the carrying values of its revenue equipment that is not protected by residual value arrangements.\nThe Company derives a material portion of its revenue from its major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nA material portion of the Company\u2019s revenue is generated from its major customers. In 2020 and 2019, the Company\u2019s top ten customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 31% and 28%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s revenue, and the Company\u2019s largest customer accounted for approximately 10% and 6%, respectively, of its revenue. In addition, a material portion of the Company\u2019s freight is from customers in the building materials industry, and as such, the Company\u2019s results may be susceptible to trends in construction cycles, which are affected by numerous factors, including rates of infrastructure spending, real estate equity values, interest rates and general economic conditions. The Company\u2019s customers\u2019 financial difficulties can negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition , especially if they were to delay or default on payments to the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s customers may terminate their relationships with the Company on short notice with limited or no penalties.\nA number of customers use the Company\u2019s services on a shipment-by-shipment basis rather than under long-term contracts. These customers have no obligation to continue using the Company\u2019s services and may stop using them at any time without penalty or with only limited penalties. The loss of any customers may reduce the range of service offerings the Company provides and adversely impact the Company\u2019s revenue mix. Also, the Company does not have contractual relationships that guarantee any minimum freight volumes with customers.\nThe Company is subject to certain risks arising from doing business in Canada and Mexico.\nThe Company provides trucking services in Canada in addition to the United States, and the Company also transports freight into and out of Mexico by transferring the Company\u2019s trailers to tractors operated by Mexican-based carriers with which the Company has contractual and long-standing relationships. As a result, the Company is subject to risks of doing business internationally, including fluctuations in foreign currencies, changes in the economic strength of Canada and Mexico, difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights through non-U.S. legal systems, burdens of complying with a wide variety of international and United States export and import laws, and social, political and economic instability. The Company also faces additional risks associated with restrictive trade policies and imposition of duties, taxes or government royalties imposed by the Canadian or Mexican government, to the extent not preempted by trade agreements between Mexico, Canada and the United States. Further, to the extent that the Company conducts operations outside of the United States, it is subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which generally prohibits United States companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining favorable treatment. If the Company is not in compliance with the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws), it may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could harm its reputation and have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Any investigation of any actual or alleged violations of such laws could also harm the Company\u2019s reputation or have a material adverse impact on its business.\nThe Company is currently a Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) participant. If the United States Customs and\nBorder Protection (CBP) determines the Company has failed to comply with its minimum security and other criteria applicable to C-TPAT participants, the Company may be unable to maintain its C-TPAT status, which may result in significant border delays, which could cause its operations in Canada to be less efficient than those of competitor truckload carriers also operating in Canada that obtain or continue to maintain C-TPAT status. Such inefficiency, as well as the requirements of some customers to deal only with C-TPAT participating carriers, could lead to a loss of certain business.\nThe Company\u2019s contractual agreements with its owner-operators expose it to risks that it does not face with its company drivers.\nApproximately 38% of the Company\u2019s freight revenue was carried by independent contractor owner-operators in 2020. The Company\u2019s reliance on independent contractor owner-operators creates numerous risks for the Company\u2019s business. For example, the Company provides financing to certain of its independent contractor owner-operators purchasing tractors from the Company. If owner-operators operating the tractors the Company financed default under or otherwise terminate the financing arrangement and the Company is unable to find a replacement owner-operator, the Company may incur losses on amounts owed to it with respect to the tractor in addition to any losses it may incur as a result of idling the tractor. Further, if the Company is unable to provide such financing in the future, due to liquidity constraints or other restrictions, the Company may experience a shortage of owner-operators.\nIf the Company\u2019s independent contractor owner-operators fail to meet the Company\u2019s contractual obligations or otherwise fail to perform in a manner consistent with the Company\u2019s requirements, the Company may be required to utilize alternative service providers at potentially higher prices or with some degree of disruption of the services that the Company provides to customers. If the Company fails to deliver on time, if its contractual obligations are not otherwise met, or if the costs of its services increase, then the Company\u2019s profitability and customer relationships could be harmed. Furthermore, independent contractor owner-operators typically use tractors, trailers and other equipment bearing the Company\u2019s trade names and trademarks. If one of the Company\u2019s independent contractor owner-operators is subject to negative publicity, it could reflect on the Company and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and brand. Under certain laws, the Company could also be subject to allegations of liability for the activities of its independent contractor owner-operators.\nOwner-operators are third-party service providers, as compared to company drivers who are employed by the Company. As independent business owners, the Company\u2019s owner-operators may make business or personal decisions that conflict with the Company\u2019s best interests. For example, if a load is unprofitable, route distance is too far from home or personal scheduling conflicts arise, an owner-operator may deny loads of freight from time to time. In these circumstances, the Company must be able to timely deliver the freight in order to maintain relationships with customers. In addition, adverse changes in the financial condition of the Company\u2019s independent contractor owner-operators or increases in their equipment or operating costs could cause them to seek higher revenues. The prices the Company charges its customers could be impacted by such issues, which may in turn limit pricing flexibility with customers.\nThe Company depends on third parties in its brokerage business, and service instability from these providers could increase the Company\u2019s operating costs or reduce its ability to offer brokerage services.\nThe Company\u2019s brokerage business is dependent upon the services of third-party capacity providers, including other truckload carriers. These third-party providers may seek other freight opportunities and may require increased compensation during times of improved freight demand or tight trucking capacity. The Company\u2019s ability to secure the services of these third-party providers on competitive terms is subject to a number of risks, including the following, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control:\n\u25cf equipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted truckload carriers and railroads;\n\u25cf interruptions in service or stoppages in transportation as a result of labor disputes, seaport strikes, network congestion, weather-related issues, acts of God or acts of terrorism;\n\u25cf changes in regulations impacting transportation and changes in transportation rates; and\n\u25cf increases in operating expenses for carriers, such as fuel costs, insurance premiums and licensing expenses, that result in a reduction in available carriers.\nRisks Relating to Human Capital\nDriver shortages and increases in driver compensation or owner-operator contracted rates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and ability to maintain or grow its business.\nDriver shortages in the industry have required, and could continue to require, the Company to spend more money to attract and retain\ncompany and owner-operator drivers. Also, the Company may face difficulty maintaining or increasing its number of company and owner-operator drivers because of the intense competition for drivers. Compliance and enforcement with initiatives included in the CSA program implemented by the FMCSA and regulations adopted by the DOT relating to driver time and safety and fitness could further reduce the availability of qualified drivers. In addition, like most in its industry, the Company suffers from a high turnover rate of drivers, especially with respect to company drivers. Further, with respect to owner-operator drivers, due to the absence of long-term personal services contracts, owner-operators can quickly terminate their business relationships with the Company. If the Company is unable to continue to attract and retain a sufficient number of company and owner-operator drivers, it could be required to operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting shipper demands or be forced to forego business that would otherwise be available to it, which developments could adversely affect its profitability and ability to maintain or grow its business.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect operations.\nThe Company\u2019s success to date has depended, and will continue to depend, largely on the skills, efforts and motivation of its key personnel who generally have significant experience with the Company and within the transportation industry. Each member of the senior management team and other key personnel are at-will employees and may voluntarily terminate his or her employment with the Company at any time with minimal notice. The loss of certain key personnel could damage critical customer relationships, result in the loss of vital institutional knowledge, experience and expertise, and impact the Company\u2019s ability to successfully operate its business and execute its business strategy. The Company does not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance on any of its officers or other employees.\nThe Company and its subsidiary operating companies have undergone significant changes in their management teams in the past two years, which may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s ability to retain or recruit key personnel, employees and drivers. These changes include: (i) in the second half of 2019, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Financial Officer resigned or were terminated; (ii) in February 2020, the Company appointed a new Chief Executive Officer, who subsequently retired at the end of 2020; (iii) in April 2020, the Company appointed a new Chief Financial Officer, (iv) in May 2020, the Company\u2019s Chief Accounting Officer resigned; (v) and in May 2020, the Company appointed a new Chief Operating Officer. The Company also experienced significant changes and turnover to its board of directors in 2019 and 2020. Leadership transitions, which the Company may continue to experience, may also cause disruption to the Company\u2019s business, result in operational and administrative inefficiencies and added costs, and adversely affect the Company\u2019s corporate governance, internal controls, enterprise risk management, business models and strategic priorities. The inability to adequately fill vacancies in key personnel positions on a timely basis could also negatively affect the Company\u2019s business, operations and ability to implement its business strategy.\nThe Company may incur substantial expenses related to its issuance of stock-based compensation. Conversely, if the Company is unable to continue to offer its employees stock-based long-term incentive compensation, the Company may need to increase the use of cash compensation or may have difficulty retaining such employees.\nSubject to stockholder approval, the Company intends to amend its current omnibus incentive plan later this year to increase the number of shares available for issuance thereunder to enable it to continue to offer eligible employees, directors and consultants stock-based incentive awards, which the Company believes will assist it in attracting and retaining such persons. The Company also intends to use, to a greater extent than previously, long-term incentive awards in its compensation policies and plans, which will increase the Company\u2019s annual compensation and benefit expenses related to the stock options and stock awards granted to participants and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s net income. Conversely, if the Company is limited in its ability to grant equity compensation awards or if stockholders do not approve an increase in the number of shares issuable under the Company\u2019s omnibus incentive plan, it would need to explore offering other compelling alternatives to supplement its compensatory arrangements, including long-term cash compensation plans or increased short-term cash compensation, in order to continue to attract and retain key personnel and other employees, which could increase its cash compensation costs and adversely affect its financial performance.\nIf the Company\u2019s employees were to unionize, its operating costs could increase and its ability to compete could be impaired.\nNone of the Company\u2019s employees are currently represented under a collective bargaining agreement; however, the Company always faces the risk that its employees will try to unionize, and if its owner-operators were ever re-classified as employees, the magnitude of this risk would increase. Further, Congress or one or more states could approve legislation and/or the National Labor Relations Board (the NLRB) could render decisions or implement rule changes that could significantly affect the Company\u2019s business and its relationship with employees, including actions that could substantially liberalize the procedures for union organization and make it easier for unions to successfully organize. In addition, the Company can offer no assurance that the Department of Labor will not\nadopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would favor the agenda of unions. Any attempt to organize by the Company\u2019s employees could result in increased legal and other associated costs and divert management attention. If the Company were to enter into a collective bargaining agreement, the terms could negatively affect its costs, efficiency, business, operations, results of operations and prospects because, among other things, restrictive work rules could hamper the Company\u2019s efforts to improve and sustain operating efficiency and could impair the Company\u2019s service reputation, some shippers may limit their use of unionized trucking companies because of the threat of strikes and other work stoppages, and an election and bargaining process could divert management\u2019s time and attention from the Company\u2019s overall objectives and impose significant expenses.\nRisks Related to the Use of Technology\nThe Company is dependent on computer and communications systems, and a systems failure, cyber-attack or data breach could cause a significant disruption to its business and cause financial losses.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware systems and infrastructure, including operating and financial reporting systems, and on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities the Company maintains to protect its systems and data. The Company\u2019s computer and communications system is critical in meeting customer expectations, effectively tracking, maintaining and operating the Company\u2019s equipment, directing and compensating the Company\u2019s employees, and interfacing with the Company\u2019s financial reporting system. The Company currently maintains its computer systems at multiple locations, including several of its offices and terminals and third-party data centers, along with computer equipment at each of its terminals. The Company\u2019s operations and those of its technology and communications service providers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, Internet failures, computer viruses, data breaches (including cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware and the like) and other events generally beyond its control.\nAlthough the Company believes that it has robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, as cyber threats continue to evolve, it may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance its information security measures and investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Even with such measures, the Company\u2019s information technology and infrastructure are subject to attacks or misappropriation by hackers and may be, and have in the past been, breached due to inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the protective measures undertaken, employee errors or omissions, malfeasance or other disruptions. In the third quarter of 2020, one of the Company\u2019s operating companies experienced a ransomware attack. Upon discovering that an unauthorized third party attempted to gain access to select servers, the Company took immediate action to stop the attack and remediate the systems. The Company also promptly launched an internal investigation with the assistance of third-party cybersecurity partners to determine the scope of the incident and any potential impacts. This cyber incident did not result in any disruptions in the operations of such operating company or of the Company or its other subsidiaries nor was there a material financial impact or ransom paid as a result of this cyber incident. In the future, however, another externally caused information security incident, such as a cyber-attack, a phishing scam, virus, ransomware attack or denial-of-service attack, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information. In addition, the Company\u2019s third-party vendors and other intermediaries with which it conducts business and transmit data could be subject to a successful cyber-attack or other information security event, and the Company cannot ensure that such third parties have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of information in the custody of those third parties.\nA significant natural disaster or cyber-attack incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware or other damage, could interrupt or delay the Company\u2019s operations, damage its reputation, cause a loss of customers, agents or third-party capacity providers, expose the Company to a risk of loss or litigation, or cause the Company to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event. Furthermore, a security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure of customer, supplier or employee or contractor information (including personally identifiable information or protected health information) could harm the Company\u2019s reputation, compel it to comply with disparate state and foreign breach notification laws and otherwise subject it to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased cost, loss of revenue and material adverse impacts on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nStrategic Risks\nThe Company may not realize all the expected benefits of its integration, business improvement and comprehensive restructuring plans, and such plans may adversely affect its business, results of operations and prospects.\nIn the second half of 2019, the Company initiated several organizational improvement plans, which resulted in significant costs, including severance and other related payments and lease termination fees. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has incurred $17.9 million in costs related to these plans. These plans could also result in significant disruptions to the Company\u2019s operations or result in the loss of customer and market share in certain geographic territories. For example, because the Company\u2019s customers interface directly with management and employees employed by subsidiaries that comprise the Company\u2019s various operating segments, any consolidation or restructuring of such subsidiaries may be not be viewed positively by customers who may choose to reassess whether to use the Company\u2019s services. If the Company does not fully realize or maintain the anticipated benefits of these plans, its business, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.\nThe Company may be unable to realize all of the intended benefits from acquisitions.\nAs part of its business strategy, the Company has in the past and may in the future acquire strategic and complementary businesses. Acquisitions may negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects because:\n\u25cf the Company may assume liabilities, including environmental liabilities, or be subject to risks beyond its estimates or what was disclosed to it;\n\u25cf the acquisition could divert management\u2019s attention and other resources from the Company\u2019s existing business;\n\u25cf to facilitate such acquisitions, the Company may incur or assume additional indebtedness or issue additional shares of stock;\n\u25cf the acquired company may require increases in working capital and capital expenditure investments to fund its growth; and\n\u25cf the acquired company may not achieve the anticipated revenue, earnings or cash flows, including as a result of the loss of any major customers or key employees, and the Company may be unable to fully realize all of the anticipated benefits and synergies from the acquisition.\nThe Company may not be able to complete divestitures successfully.\nAs part of the Company\u2019s business strategy, it evaluates the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help it meet its objectives. When the Company decides to sell assets or a business, it may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, or at all. The Company may also dispose of assets or a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than it had anticipated. In addition, it may experience greater dis-synergies than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on its business, results of operations and prospects may be larger than projected. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. Under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of the Company\u2019s control could affect its future financial results. Moreover, seeking divestiture opportunities and evaluating and completing them require significant investment of time and resources, may disrupt the Company\u2019s business, distract management from other responsibilities and may result in losses on disposal.\nRisks Relating to Indebtedness and Liquidity\nThe Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy its obligations under applicable debt instruments, which may not be successful.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $679.7 million of indebtedness outstanding. Its ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance its indebtedness obligations depends on its financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond its control. The Company may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit it to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on its indebtedness. If the Company\u2019s cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund debt service obligations, the Company may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance indebtedness. The Company\u2019s ability to restructure or refinance indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and its financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require the Company to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict the Company from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of the Company\u2019s credit rating, which could harm its ability to incur additional indebtedness.\nThe Company\u2019s credit facilities (as defined below) and the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock contain restrictive covenants that\nmay impair its ability to conduct business. The inability to maintain compliance with these covenants could lead to default and acceleration under the credit facilities.\nThe Company\u2019s credit facilities and terms of the Series A Preferred Stock contain operating and financial covenants that limit management\u2019s discretion with respect to certain business matters. Among other things, these covenants, subject to certain limitations and exceptions, restrict the Company\u2019s ability to incur additional indebtedness, change the nature of the business, merge or consolidate with, or acquire, another entity, and sell or otherwise dispose of assets. In addition, the Company\u2019s credit facilities and certain of its other debt agreements require it to maintain certain financial ratios or to reduce its indebtedness if it is unable to comply with such ratios. These restrictions may also limit the Company\u2019s ability to obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in its business or the economy in general, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. The Company may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations that its debt agreements impose on it. A breach of any covenant in the Company\u2019s credit facilities or certain of its other debt agreements would result in a default thereunder after any applicable grace periods expire and, if not waived, could result in acceleration of amounts borrowed thereunder. Further, the Company\u2019s credit facilities and certain of its other debt agreements contain cross-default provisions, such that a default under one agreement would create a default under the other agreements.\nThe Company\u2019s leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect its business and prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $679.7 million of indebtedness outstanding. The Company\u2019s level of indebtedness could adversely affect it in several ways, including the following:\n\u25cf require the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to service its existing debt, thereby reducing the cash available to finance its operations and other business activities;\n\u25cf limit management\u2019s discretion in operating its business and its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which it operates;\n\u25cf increase its vulnerability to downturns and adverse developments in its business and the economy generally;\n\u25cf limit its ability to access the capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions or to refinance existing indebtedness;\n\u25cf make it more likely that a reduction in its borrowing base following a periodic redetermination could require it to repay a portion of its then-outstanding bank borrowings; and\n\u25cf make it vulnerable to increases in interest rates as indebtedness under the Company\u2019s credit facilities may vary with prevailing interest rates.\nWhile the Company\u2019s credit facilities contain restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to incur additional indebtedness, such restrictions are subject to waiver and a number of significant qualifications and exceptions. Indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Additional leverage increases the risks described above as well as under \u201c- The Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy its obligations under applicable debt instruments, which may not be successful.\u201d\nThe Company has significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements. If the Company is unable to obtain such capital, its business, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s business is capital intensive. Its capital expenditures focus primarily on revenue equipment replacement and, to a lesser extent, facilities, revenue equipment growth and investments in information technology. The Company may not be able to finance all of its capital requirements, when and if needed, to acquire new equipment on reasonable terms or at all. Any sale of additional equity or debt securities to fund its capital expenditures may result in dilution to its stockholders, and public or private financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all, it may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate future activities or growth initiatives, which could adversely affect its business, results of operations and prospects. In such case, the Company may also operate its revenue equipment for longer periods, which would result in increased maintenance costs.\nRisks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Compliance\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated industry, and changes in existing laws or regulations, or liability under existing or future laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and prospects.\nThe Company operates in the United States pursuant to operating authority granted by the DOT and in various Canadian provinces pursuant to operating authority granted by the Ministries of Transportation and Communications in such provinces. The Company, as well as its company and owner-operator drivers, must also comply with governmental regulations regarding safety, equipment, environmental protection and operating methods. The Company may become subject to new, or amendment of existing, laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement that may impose more restrictive regulations relating to such matters that may require changes in its operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services, require it to incur significant additional operating costs or capital expenditures or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation\u201d for information regarding several proposed, pending and final regulations that could significantly impact the Company\u2019s business and operations. Restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions or climate change laws or regulations, as well as recent activism directed at companies with energy-related assets, could also adversely affect certain of the Company\u2019s customers, which, in turn, could adversely impact the demand for the Company\u2019s services. The Company also could lose revenue if its customers divert business from it because the Company has not complied with customer sustainability requirements.\nSafety-related evaluations and rankings under the CSA program could adversely impact the Company\u2019s relationships with its customers and its ability to maintain or grow its fleet, each of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and prospects.\nThe CSA includes compliance and enforcement initiatives designed to monitor and improve commercial motor vehicle safety by measuring the safety record of both the motor carrier and the driver. These measurements are scored and used by the FMCSA to identify potential safety risks and to direct enforcement action. The Company\u2019s CSA scores are dependent upon its safety and compliance experience, which could change at any time. In addition, the safety standards prescribed in the CSA program or the underlying methodology used by the FMCSA to determine a carrier\u2019s safety rating could change and, as a result, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain an acceptable score could be adversely impacted. If the Company receives an unacceptable CSA score, its relationships with customers could be damaged, which could result in a loss of business. Additionally, the requirements of CSA could shrink the industry\u2019s pool of drivers as those with unfavorable scores could leave the industry. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation\u201d for additional discussion related to CSA program risks.\nThe Company is subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations that may expose it to significant costs and liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to stringent and comprehensive federal, state, provincial, local and foreign environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other matters, the operation of fuel storage tanks, release of emissions from its vehicles (including engine idling) and facilities, the health and safety of the public and its workers in conducting operations, and adverse impacts to the environment (including sustainability practices). These laws are becoming increasingly more stringent and there can be no assurances that compliance with, or liabilities under, existing or future environmental and worker health or safety laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation\u201d and \u201cItem 1. Business - Fuel\u201d for more information.\nThe Company maintains aboveground and underground bulk fuel storage tanks and fueling islands at some of its facilities and vehicle maintenance operations at certain of its facilities, and its operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage into the environment, environmental and natural resource damages and unauthorized hazardous material spills, releases or disposal actions, among others. If the Company has operational spills or accidents or if it is found to be in violation of, or otherwise liable under, environmental or worker health or safety laws or regulations, the Company could incur significant costs and liabilities, which may include the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays in permitting or performance of projects, and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of the Company\u2019s operations in a particular area. Under certain environmental laws, the Company could be subject to strict joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, for costs relating to contamination at facilities the Company owns or operates or previously owned or operated and at third-party sites where the Company disposed of waste, as well as costs associated with the clean-up of releases arising from accidents involving the Company\u2019s vehicles. The Company often operates in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located, and where soil, groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred from historical or recent releases and for which the Company has incurred and may, in the future, incur remedial or other environmental liabilities.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations may also increase the price of the Company\u2019s equipment and otherwise affect the economics of the Company\u2019s industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for, or the costs\nof providing, transportation services. Also, in order to reduce exhaust emissions, some states and municipalities have begun to restrict the locations and amount of time where diesel-powered tractors, such as the Company\u2019s, may idle. These restrictions could force the Company to alter its drivers\u2019 behavior, purchase on-board power units that do not require the engine to idle or face a decrease in productivity.\nThe Company is, and in the future may be, subject to the legal and governmental proceedings and claims, which may impair the Company\u2019s reputation or result in the Company incurring significant costs.\nThe parties in such legal actions against the Company may seek amounts from the Company that may not be covered in whole or in part by insurance, and negative publicity resulting from allegations therein, whether or not valid, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation. In particular, there has been a recent increase in auto liability lawsuits filed against transportation companies, and the size of judgments awarded in such lawsuits has trended upwards and may continue to do so.\nIf the Company\u2019s owner-operators are deemed by regulators or judicial process to be employees, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTax and other regulatory authorities have in the past sought to assert that owner-operators in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors. If the Company\u2019s owner-operators are determined to be its employees, it would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be harmed by terrorist attacks, future wars or anti-terrorism measures.\nIn the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, federal, state and municipal authorities have implemented and are implementing various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks and fingerprinting of drivers in connection with new hazardous materials endorsements on their licenses. Such existing measures and future measures may have significant costs associated with them which a motor carrier is forced to bear. Moreover, large trucks carrying large freight are potential terrorist targets, and the Company may be obligated to take measures, including possible capital expenditures intended to protect its trucks.\nChanges to trade regulation, quotas, duties or tariffs, caused by changing U.S. and geopolitical environments or otherwise, may increase the Company\u2019s costs and materially adversely affect its business.\nThe implementation of tariffs, quotas or changes to certain trade agreements by the United States or retaliatory trade measures or tariffs implemented by other countries, could, among other things, increase the costs of the materials used by the Company\u2019s suppliers to produce new revenue equipment or increase the price of fuel. Such cost increases for the Company\u2019s revenue equipment suppliers might be passed on to the Company, and to the extent fuel prices increase, the Company may not be able to fully recover such increases through rate increases or the Company\u2019s fuel surcharge program. Further, the continued threats of tariffs, trade restrictions, and trade barriers could have a generally disruptive impact on the economy generally and decrease demand for the Company\u2019s services.\nOther Material Risks\nThe Company\u2019s total assets include goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. If the Company determines that these items have become impaired in the future, net income could be materially and adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had recorded goodwill of $140.1 million and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $50.9 million. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification, Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, the Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment annually and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. Any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the Company\u2019s results of operations. Further, the Company may never realize the full value of its intangible assets. Any future determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of intangible assets could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. If there are changes to the methods used to allocate carrying values, if management\u2019s estimates of future operating results change, if there are changes in the\nidentified reporting units or if there are changes to other significant assumptions, the estimated carrying values and the estimated fair value of the Company\u2019s goodwill and long-lived assets could change significantly, and could result in future non-cash impairment charges, which could materially impact its results of operations and financial condition for any such future period. During 2020, the Company recorded an impairment charge to intangibles assets of $8.2 million related to tradenames. The Company\u2019s decision to dispose of certain of its operations may require it to recognize an impairment to the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets attendant to those operations. For example, in 2020, in connection with the Aveda disposition, the Company recognized an impairment of $6.2 million related to other intangible assets.\nWe may fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our internal resources and personnel may be insufficient to avoid accounting errors, and there can be no assurance that we will not have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. For example, two material weaknesses relating to information technology general controls and management\u2019s review of the specialists\u2019 impairment analysis were identified in the third quarter of 2019. These material weaknesses have been fully remediated, but we cannot assure you that our efforts to identify and prevent additional material weaknesses in the future will be successful.\nA small number of the Company\u2019s stockholders hold a substantial portion of its outstanding common stock.\nMr. Daseke and his affiliates beneficially owned approximately 28% of the Company\u2019s common stock as of December 31, 2020. Consequently, Mr. Daseke and his affiliates are able to strongly influence all matters that require approval by the Company\u2019s stockholders, including changes to the Company\u2019s organizational documents and approval of acquisition and disposition offers and other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership will limit other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters, and as a result, actions may be taken that you may not view as beneficial and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with a controlling stockholder.\nThe Company\u2019s charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by its stockholders, which could limit its stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers, employees or agents.\nThe Company\u2019s charter provides that, unless it consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on the Company\u2019s behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of the Company\u2019s directors, officers, employees or agents to us or the Company\u2019s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) or the Company\u2019s charter or bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Company that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of the Company\u2019s charter described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of the Company\u2019s charter inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies\u2019 charters has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with one or more actions or proceedings described above, a court could rule that this provision in the Company\u2019s charter is inapplicable or unenforceable. For example, the choice of forum provisions summarized above are not intended to, and would not, apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the Company\u2019s choice of forum provisions would be enforceable with respect to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), or other claims for which the federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction, and in any event stockholders will not be deemed to have waived the Company\u2019s compliance with federal securities laws and rules and regulations thereunder.\nSome provisions of the Company\u2019s governing documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for its common stock.\nSome provisions in the Company\u2019s charter and bylaws may have the effect of delaying, discouraging, or preventing an acquisition of the Company or a merger in which the Company is not the surviving company and may otherwise prevent or slow changes in the Company\u2019s board of directors and management. These provisions include:\n\u25cf no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u25cf the exclusive right of the Company\u2019s board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director with or without cause by stockholders, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on the Company\u2019s board of directors;\n\u25cf the ability of the Company\u2019s board of directors to determine whether to issue shares of the Company\u2019s preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u25cf a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of the Company\u2019s stockholders;\n\u25cf the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, or the board of directors, which may delay the ability of the Company\u2019s stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u25cf limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, the Company\u2019s directors and officers;\n\u25cf controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of stockholder meetings; and\n\u25cf advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to the Company\u2019s board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nAs a Delaware corporation, the Company is also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits business combinations between the Company and one or more significant stockholders unless specified conditions are met. These provisions could discourage an acquisition of the Company or other change in control transaction, whether or not it is desired or beneficial to the Company\u2019s stockholders, and thereby negatively affect the price that investors might be willing to pay for the Company\u2019s common stock as well as deprive stockholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and may fluctuate significantly, which may adversely impact investor confidence and increase the likelihood of securities class action litigation.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock price has experienced volatility in the past and may remain volatile in the future. The highly volatile nature of the Company\u2019s stock price may cause investment losses for its stockholders. Volatility in the Company\u2019s common stock price can be driven by many factors, including divergence between its actual or anticipated financial results and published expectations of analysts or the expectations of the market, the gain or loss of customers, announcements that the Company, its competitors or its customers may make regarding their operating results and other factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as market conditions in the Company\u2019s or its customers\u2019 industry, new market entrants, technological innovations, and economic and political conditions or events. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company and stockholder activism, which could take many forms, including shareholder litigation, takeover or take private attempts, and proxy contests may increase. Securities litigation and stockholder activism could result in substantial costs and divert the attention of the Company\u2019s management or board of directors and could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to the Company\u2019s future, which, in turn, could adversely affect its relationships with customers and make it more difficult to attract qualified personnel.\nVolatility or lack of performance in the Company\u2019s stock price may also affect the Company\u2019s ability to attract new key personnel or retain existing key personnel by decreasing the perceived value of any stock-based compensation the Company may offer or that they may hold. Prolonged periods of low performance or volatility in the Company\u2019s stock price could also negatively impact the Company\u2019s appeal as an employer, harm employee morale or increase employee turnover, including among the Company\u2019s key personnel. In addition, during periods when the Company\u2019s stock price is low, the Company may issue greater amounts of equity-based compensation to its executives and other key personnel to retain them and incentivize long-term performance, which may over\nsuccessive periods cause dilution in the value of the Company\u2019s stock and increase the Company\u2019s stock-based compensation expense.\nThe Company does not currently pay dividends on its common stock.\nAny future dividend payments are within the absolute discretion of the Company\u2019s board of directors and will depend on, among other things, its results of operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, financial condition, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions with respect to payment of dividends, business opportunities, anticipated cash needs, provisions of applicable law and other factors that the Company\u2019s board of directors may deem relevant. Consequently, a stockholder\u2019s only opportunity to achieve a return on its investment in the Company will be if the stockholder sells its common stock at a price greater than the stockholder paid for it.", "PERMNO": 15654, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "HCAC.2"}
