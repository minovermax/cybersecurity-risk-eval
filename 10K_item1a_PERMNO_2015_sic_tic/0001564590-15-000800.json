RISK FACTORS\nYOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION. THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WE FACE. ADDITIONAL RISKS THAT WE ARE NOT PRESENTLY AWARE OF OR THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE ARE IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO IMPAIR OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED BY ANY OR ALL OF THESE RISKS. THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO ANY OF THESE RISKS, AND YOU MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT. IN ASSESSING THESE RISKS, YOU SHOULD ALSO REFER TO THE OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, INCLUDING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES.\nCompetition in each of our markets is intense, and our inability to compete effectively could significantly harm our business and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC for our UC&C solutions, which can place pressure on average selling prices for our products. Some of our competitors compete with us in more than one geographic theater and across all of our product categories. Our major global competitor is Cisco Systems. Our other global competitors include Acano, Avaya Inc., Blue Jeans Network, ClearOne Communications, Inc., Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., Logitech International S.A./LifeSize, PexIP AS, Snom Technology AG, Vidyo, Inc., Yamaha Corporation/Revolabs, Inc., Yealink, ZTE Corporation and others.\nOur competitive landscape continues to rapidly evolve as we move into new markets for collaboration such as mobile, browser-based, and cloud-delivered collaboration offerings. Competitors in these markets also continue to develop and introduce new technologies, sometimes proprietary, that represent threats through closed architectures. We also compete with other offerings such as Cisco Systems\u2019 Jabber and WebEx and Citrix Systems\u2019 GoToMeeting with HD Faces. Many of these companies have substantial financial resources and production, marketing, engineering and other capabilities with which to develop, manufacture, market and sell their products, which may result in our having to lower our product prices and increase our spending on sales and marketing, which would correspondingly have a negative impact on our revenues and operating margins.\nOur principal competitive factors in the markets and categories in which we presently compete and may compete include the ability to:\n\u25cf\nprovide and sell a broad range of UC&C solutions and services, including mobile and cloud-based solutions, and our ability to bring new products to market on a timely basis;\n\u25cf\ncompetitively price our products and solutions;\n\u25cf\nprovide competitive product performance;\n\u25cf\ncompete successfully in multiple markets with differing requirements, including, but not limited to, the enterprise, SMB, mobile video, social video, browser-based video, subscription-based video delivered from the cloud and service provider markets;\n\u25cf\nintroduce new products and solutions in a timely manner;\n\u25cf\nreduce production and service costs;\n\u25cf\nprovide required functionality such as security, reliability, and scalability;\n\u25cf\nensure investment protection through broad interoperability and backwards- and forwards-compatibility with other UC&C systems and solutions;\n\u25cf\nsuccessfully integrate our products with, and operate our products on, existing customer platforms and consumer devices;\n\u25cf\ngain market presence and brand recognition;\n\u25cf\nextend credit to our partners;\n\u25cf\nconform to open standards;\n\u25cf\nsuccessfully address disruptive technology shifts and new business models, such as cloud-based and software-based UC&C solutions and mobility and consumer solutions; and\n\u25cf\nsuccessfully address the transition in the market from point product to solution selling.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved performance. New product introductions by our current or future competitors, or our delay in bringing new products to market, could cause a significant decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our products. We believe that ongoing competitive pressure may result in a reduction in the prices of our products and our competitors\u2019 products. In addition, the introduction of additional lower priced competitive products or of new products or product platforms could render our existing products or technologies obsolete. We also believe we will face increasing competition from alternative UC&C solutions that employ new technologies or new combinations of technologies. Further, the commoditization of certain video conferencing products is leading to the availability of alternative, lower-cost UC&C products than ours that are targeted to consumers and small businesses, such as Skype, Google Talk/Hangouts, Apple FaceTime and others, which could drive down our sales prices and negatively impact our revenues.\nIncreased consolidation and the formation of strategic partnerships in our industry may lead to increased competition, which could adversely affect our business and future results of operations.\nStrategic partnerships and acquisitions are being formed and announced by our competitors on a regular basis, which increases competition and often results in increased downward pressure on our product prices. For instance, since Cisco Systems acquired Tandberg ASA, previously our largest independent competitor, we have had to compete with a larger combined company with significantly greater financial and sales and marketing resources, an extensive channel network and an expanded video communications solutions product line. This product line is often sold in conjunction with Cisco Systems\u2019 proprietary network equipment and technology as a complete solution, making it more difficult for us to compete against them or to ascertain pricing on competitive products. In addition, Cisco Systems may use its dominance in network equipment to foreclose competition in the UC&C solutions market. Cisco Systems may also preclude our competitive products from being fully interoperable with Cisco Systems\nendpoints, video infrastructure and/or network products. These consolidations and partnerships have resulted in increased competition and pricing pressure, as the newly-combined entities have greater financial resources, deeper mass market sales channels and greater pricing flexibility than we do. Acquisitions or partnerships made by one of our strategic partners could also limit the potential contribution of our strategic relationships to our business and restrict our ability to form strategic relationships with these companies in the future and, as a result, harm our business. Rumored or actual consolidation of our partners and competitors will likely cause uncertainty and disruption to our business and can cause our stock price to fluctuate.\nGlobal economic conditions have adversely affected our business in the past and could adversely affect our revenues and harm our business in the future.\nAdverse economic conditions worldwide have contributed to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries and have caused a negative impact on the specific segments and markets in which we operate. Adverse changes in general global economic conditions can result in reductions in capital expenditures by end-user customers for our products, longer sales cycles, the deferral or delay of purchase commitments for our products and increased competition. These factors have adversely impacted our operating results in prior periods and could also impact us again in the future. Global economic concerns, such as the varying pace of global economic recovery and European and domestic debt and budget issues, continue to create uncertainty and unpredictability that have contributed to longer selling cycles and cause us to continue to be cautious about our future outlook, including our near-term revenue and profitability outlook. For example, we have seen weakening demand and longer sales cycles in the public sector, which includes federal, state and local governments, as well as healthcare and education, which we believe were due in large part to budget constraints, as well as political issues. A global economic downturn would negatively impact technology spending for our products and services and would materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Further, we have seen slower growth compared to prior years in China, Brazil, and other growth markets, which we believe is due in part to macro-economic factors. Global economic conditions have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity levels in many financial markets, decrease in customer demand and ability to pay obligations, and extreme volatility in credit, equity, foreign currency and fixed income markets.\nThese adverse economic conditions could negatively impact our business, particularly our revenue potential, losses on investments and the collectability of our accounts receivable, due to the inability of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and services, customer or partner insolvencies or bankruptcies, decreased customer confidence to make purchasing decisions resulting in delays in their purchasing decisions, and decreased customer demand or demand for lower-end products.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and are not necessarily a good indicator of future performance.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may vary significantly in the future as a result of a number of factors, many of which are out of our control or can be difficult to predict. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in demand for our products and services, in part due to uncertain global economic conditions and increased competition, as well as transitions in the markets in which we sell products and services;\n\u25cf\nour ability to execute on our strategic and operating plans;\n\u25cf\nslowing sales or variations in sales rates by our channel partners to their customers;\n\u25cf\nchanges to our channel partner programs, contracts and strategy that could result in a reduction in the number of channel partners, could adversely impact our revenues and gross margins as we realign our discount and rebate programs for our channels, or could cause more of our channel partners to add our competitors\u2019 products to their portfolio;\n\u25cf\nthe prices and performance of our products and those of our existing or potential new competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe timing, size and mix of the orders for our products;\n\u25cf\nthe level and mix of inventory that we hold to meet future demand;\n\u25cf\nchanges to our global organization and retention of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nchanges in effective tax rates which are difficult to predict due to, among other things, the timing and geographical mix of our earnings, the outcome of current or future tax audits and potential new rules and regulations;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the underlying factors and assumptions used in determining stock-based compensation;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the level of international sales and our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations on both revenues and expenses;\n\u25cf\ndependence on component suppliers and third party manufacturers, which includes outside development manufacturers, and the associated manufacturing costs;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of changing costs of freight and components used in the manufacturing of our products and the potential negative impact on our gross margins;\n\u25cf\nthe magnitude of any costs that we must incur in the event of a product recall or of costs associated with product warranty claims;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of seasonality on our various product lines and geographic regions; and\n\u25cf\nadverse outcomes in intellectual property litigation and other matters and the costs associated with asserting and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio.\nAs a result of these and potentially other factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our historical results of operations are not necessarily a good predictor of our future performance. If our future operating results are below the expectations of stock market securities analysts or investors, or below any financial guidance we may provide to the market, our stock price will likely decline. Financial guidance beyond the current quarter is inherently subject to greater risk and uncertainty, and if the transitions in our markets accelerate, our ability to forecast becomes more difficult.\nWe face risks associated with developing and marketing our products, including new product development and new product lines.\nOur success depends on our ability to assimilate new technologies in our products and to properly train our channel partners, sales force and end-user customers in the use of those products.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, such as the demand for HD video technology and lower cost video infrastructure products, the shift from on premise-based equipment to a mix of solutions that includes hardware and software and the option for customers to have video delivered as a service from the cloud or through a browser, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions, including an increased emphasis on software products and new, lower cost hardware products. Historically, our focus has been on premise-based solutions for the enterprise and public sector, targeted at vertical markets, including finance, manufacturing, government, education and healthcare. In addition, in response to emerging market trends, and the network effect driven by business-to-business and business-to-consumer adoption of UC&C, we are expanding our focus to capture opportunities within emerging markets including mobile, small and medium businesses (\u201cSMBs\u201d), and cloud-based delivery. If we are unable to successfully capture these markets to the extent anticipated, or to develop the new technologies and partnerships required to successfully compete in these markets, then our revenues may not grow as anticipated and our business may ultimately be harmed. Given the competitive nature of the mobile industry, changing end user behaviors and other industry dynamics, these relationships may not evolve into fully-developed product offerings or translate into any future revenues.\nThe success of our new products depends on several factors, including proper new product definition, product cost, infrastructure for services and cloud delivery, timely completion and introduction of new products, proper positioning and pricing of new products in relation to our total product portfolio and their relative pricing, differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and other products in our own portfolio, market acceptance of these products and the ability to sell our products to customers as comprehensive UC&C solutions. Other factors that may affect our success include properly addressing the complexities associated with compatibility issues, channel partner and sales force training, technical and sales support, and field support. As a result, it is possible that investments that we are making in developing new products and technologies may not yield the planned financial results.\nWe also need to continually educate and train our channel partners to avoid any confusion as to the desirability of new product offerings and solutions compared to our existing product offerings and to be able to articulate and differentiate the value of new offerings over those of our competitors. As the market evolves, our distribution model and channel partners may change as well. During the last few years, we launched several new product offerings, including new software, hardware and cloud-based solutions, and these new products could cause confusion among our channel partners and end-users, thereby causing them to delay purchases of our new products until they determine their market acceptance, or as they consider a more comprehensive UC&C strategy versus point product or endpoint only deployments. Any delays in future purchases could adversely affect our revenues, gross margins and operating results in the period of the delay.\nThe shift in communications from circuit-switched to IP-based and other new technologies over time may require us to add new channel partners, enter new markets and gain new core technological competencies. We are attempting to address these needs and the need to develop new products through our internal development efforts, through joint developments with other companies and through acquisitions. However, we may not identify successful new product opportunities and develop and bring products to market in a timely manner. Further, as we introduce new products, these product transition cycles may not go smoothly, causing an increased risk of inventory obsolescence and relationship issues with our end-user customers and channel partners. The failure of our new product development efforts, any inability to service or maintain the necessary third-party interoperability licenses, our inability to properly manage product transitions or to anticipate new product demand, or our inability to enter new markets would harm our business and results of operations.\nWe may experience delays in product introductions and availability, and our products may contain defects which could seriously harm our results of operations.\nWe have experienced delays in the introduction of certain new products and enhancements in the past. The delays in product release dates that we experienced in the past have been due to factors such as unforeseen technology issues, manufacturing ramping issues and other factors, which we believe negatively impacted our sales revenue in the relevant periods. Any of these or other factors may occur again and delay our future product releases. Our product development groups are dispersed throughout the United States and other international locations such as China, India and Israel. As such, disruption due to geopolitical conflicts could create an increased risk of delays in new product introductions.\nWe produce highly complex communications equipment, which includes both hardware and software and incorporates new technologies and component parts from different suppliers. Resolving product defect and technology and quality issues could cause delays in new product introduction. Component part shortages could also cause delays in product delivery and lead to increased costs. Further, some defects may not be detected or cured prior to a new product launch, or may be detected after a product has already been launched and may be incurable or result in a product recall. The occurrence of any of these events could result in the failure of a partial or entire product line or a withdrawal of a product from the market. We may also have to invest significant capital and other resources to correct these problems, including product reengineering expenses and inventory, warranty and replacement costs. These problems might also result in claims against us by our customers or others and could harm our reputation and adversely affect future sales of our products.\nAny delays for new product offerings currently under development, including product offerings for mobile, cloud-based delivery, software delivery or any product quality issues, product defect issues or product recalls could adversely affect the market acceptance of these products, our ability to compete effectively in the market, and our reputation with our customers, and therefore could lead to decreased product sales and could harm our business. We may also experience cancellation of orders, difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, increased service and warranty costs in excess of our estimates, diversion of resources and increased insurance costs and other losses to our business or to end-user customers.\nProduct obsolescence or discontinuance and excess inventory can negatively affect our results of operations.\nThe pace of change in technology development and in the release of new products has increased and is expected to continue to increase, which can often render existing or developing technologies obsolete. In addition, the introduction of new products and any related actions to discontinue existing products can cause existing inventory to become obsolete. These obsolescence issues, or any failure by us to properly anticipate product life cycles, can require write-downs in inventory value. For each of our products, the potential exists for new products to render existing products obsolete, cause inventories of existing products to increase, cause us to discontinue a product or reduce the demand for existing products.\nFurther, we continually evaluate our product lines both strategically and in terms of potential growth rates and margins. Such evaluations could result in the discontinuance or divestiture of those products in the future, which could be disruptive and costly and may not yield the intended benefits. For example, we divested our enterprise wireless solutions business in December 2012.\nWe face risks related to the adoption rate of new technologies.\nWe have invested significant resources developing products that are dependent on the adoption rate of new technologies. For example, our Polycom\u00ae RealPresence\u00ae One and Polycom\u00ae RealPresence\u00ae Virtual Edition platform software solutions are dependent on enterprise adoption of software based video bridging applications. If the software related video bridging market does not grow as we anticipate, or if our strategy for addressing the market, or execution of such strategy, is not successful, our business and results of operations could be harmed. In addition, we develop new products or make product enhancements based upon anticipated demand for new features and functionality. Our business and revenues may be harmed if the use of new technologies that our future products are based on does not occur; if we do not anticipate shifts in technology appropriately or rapidly enough; if the development of suitable sales channels does not occur, or occurs more slowly than expected; if our products are not priced competitively or are not readily adopted; or if the adoption rates of such new technologies do not drive demand for our other products as we anticipate. For example, although we believe increased sales of UC&C solutions will drive increased demand for our UC hardware and software platform products, such increased demand may not occur or we may not benefit to the same extent as our competitors. We also may not be successful in creating demand in our installed customer base for products that we develop that incorporate new technologies or features. Conversely, as we see the adoption rate of new technologies increase, product sales of our legacy products may be negatively impacted, which could materially impact our revenues and results of operations.\nLower than expected market acceptance of our products, price competition and other price changes would negatively impact our business.\nIf the market does not accept our products, particularly our new product offerings on which we are relying on for future revenues, such as product offerings for platform software, new hardware products and cloud-based delivery, our business and operating results would be harmed. Further, revenues relating to new product offerings are unpredictable, and new products typically have lower gross margins for a period of time after their introduction and higher marketing and sales costs. As we introduce new products, they could increasingly become a higher percentage of our revenues. Our profitability could also be negatively affected in the future as a result of continuing competitive price pressures in the sale of UC&C solutions equipment and UC platform products. Further, in the past we have reduced prices in order to expand the market for our products, and in the future, we may further reduce prices, introduce new products that carry lower margins in order to expand the market or stimulate demand for our products, or discontinue existing products as a means of stimulating growth in a new product.\nFinally, if we do not fully anticipate, understand and fulfill the needs of end-user customers in the vertical markets that we serve, we may not be able to fully capitalize on product sales into those vertical markets and our revenues may, accordingly, fail to grow as anticipated or may be adversely impacted. We face similar risks as we expand and focus our business on the SMB and service provider markets.\nFailure to adequately service and support our product offerings could harm our results of operations.\nThe increasing complexity of our products and associated technologies has increased the need for enhanced product warranty and service capabilities, including integration services, which may require us to develop or acquire additional advanced service capabilities and make additional investments. If we cannot adequately develop and train our internal support organization or maintain our relationships with our outside technical support providers, it could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, sales of our immersive telepresence solutions are complex sales transactions, and the end-user customer typically purchases an enhanced level of support service from us so as to ensure that its significant investment can be fully operational and realized. This requires us to provide advanced services and project management in terms of resources and technical knowledge of the customer\u2019s telecommunication network. If we are unable to provide the proper level of support on a cost efficient basis, it may cause damage to our reputation in this market and may harm our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to successfully attract and retain highly qualified management personnel and key employees, our business may be harmed.\nOur future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire, assimilate and retain highly qualified senior executives and other key management personnel. As new hires assess their areas of responsibilities and define their organizations, disruption to the business and additional organizational changes or restructuring actions and charges could occur. We have had turnover in a number of senior executive positions, including our chief executive officer, our chief financial officer and head of worldwide engineering. In December 2013, we appointed a new CEO, and in the second quarter of 2014, we appointed a new chief financial officer and a new head of worldwide engineering. In addition, we recently appointed a new chief human resources officer and new heads of sales in APAC and EMEA. These transitions, along with the hiring of other new senior managers, may be disruptive to our business, and if we are unable to execute an orderly transition, our revenue, operating results and financial condition may be adversely impacted. Future changes to our executive and senior management teams, including new executive hires or departures, could cause further disruption to the business and have a negative impact on our operating performance, while these operational areas are in transition. Competition for qualified executive and other management personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel.\nWe face risks related to our dependence on channel partners to sell our products.\nChanges to our channel partner programs or channel partner contracts may not be favorably received and as a result our channel partner relationships and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nOur channel partners are eligible to participate in various incentive programs, depending upon their contractual arrangements with us. As part of these arrangements, we have the right to make changes in our programs and launch new programs as business conditions warrant. Further, from time to time, we may make changes to our channel partner contracts or realign our discount and rebate programs. These changes could upset our channel partners which could cause them to add competitive products to their portfolios, delay advertising or sales of our products, or shift more emphasis to selling our competitors\u2019 products. Our channel partners may not be receptive to future changes, and we may not receive the positive benefits that we anticipate in making any program and contractual changes.\nOur strategic partnerships with companies may not yield the desired results which could harm our business.\nWe are focusing on our strategic partnerships and alliances with Microsoft, AT&T, BroadSoft and IBM. Defining, managing and developing these partnerships is expensive and time-consuming and may not come to fruition or yield the desired results, impacting our ability to effectively compete in the market and to take advantage of anticipated future market growth. For example, our key strategic relationship with Microsoft, in which we are jointly developing and marketing a UC&C solution that leverages the demand for Microsoft\u2019s next generation UC server, could negatively impact our ability to compete effectively in the UC&C marketplace if we are unsuccessful. Our mobile solutions are also dependent on our ability to successfully partner with mobile device manufacturers.\nIn addition, as we enter into agreements with these strategic partners to enable us to continue to expand our relationships with these partners, we may undertake additional obligations, such as development efforts, which could trigger unintended penalty or other provisions in the event that we fail to fully perform our contractual commitments or could result in additional costs beyond those that are planned in order to meet these contractual obligations.\nConflicts between our channel partners and strategic partners could arise which could harm our business.\nSome of our current and future products are directly competitive with the products sold by both our channel and strategic partners. As a result of these conflicts, there is the potential for our channel and strategic partners to compete head-to-head with us or to significantly reduce or eliminate their orders of our products or design our technology out of their products. Further, as a result of our more direct-touch sales model, we may alienate some of our channel partners or cause a shift in product sales from our traditional channel model. Due to these and other factors, channel conflicts could arise which cause channel partners to devote resources to non-Polycom communications equipment, or to offer new products from our competitors, which would negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, some of our products are reliant on strategic partnerships with call manager providers and wireless UC&C platform providers. These partnerships result in interoperable features between products to deliver a total solution to our mutual end-user customers. Competition with our partners in all of the markets in which we operate is likely to increase, which would adversely affect our revenues and could potentially strain our existing relationships with these companies.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our channel partners\u2019 sales reporting, product inventories and product sell-through.\nWe sell a significant amount of our products to channel partners who maintain their own inventory of our products for sale to dealers and end-users. Our revenue forecasts associated with products stocked by some of our channel partners are based largely on end-user sales reports that our channel partners provide to us on a monthly basis. Even though we believe this data has been generally accurate, to the extent that this sales-out and channel inventory data is inaccurate or not received timely, our revenue forecasts for future periods may be less reliable. Further, if these channel partners are unable to sell an adequate amount of their inventory of our products in a given quarter or if channel partners decide to decrease their inventories for any reason, such as a recurrence of global economic uncertainty and downturn in technology spending, the volume of our sales to these channel partners and our revenues would be negatively affected. In addition, we also face the risk that some of our channel partners have inventory levels in excess of future anticipated sales. If such sales do not occur in the time frame anticipated by these channel partners for any reason, these channel partners may substantially decrease the amount of product they order from us in subsequent periods, or product returns may exceed historical or predicted levels, which would harm our business and create unexpected variations in our financial results.\nConsolidation of our channel partners and strategic partners may result in changes to our overall business relationships, less favorable contractual terms and disruption to our business.\nWe have seen consolidation among certain of our existing channel partners and strategic partners. In such instances, we may experience changes to our overall business and operational relationships due to dealing with a larger combined entity, and our ability to maintain such relationships on favorable contractual terms may be limited. Depending on the extent of these changes and other disruptions caused to the combined businesses during the integration period, the timing and extent of revenue from these channel partners may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the success of the businesses of our channel partners.\nMany of our channel partners that carry multiple Polycom products, and from whom we derive significant revenues, are thinly capitalized. Although we perform ongoing evaluations of the creditworthiness of our channel partners, the failure of these businesses to establish and sustain profitability, obtain financing or adequately fund capital expenditures could have a significant negative effect on our future revenue levels and profitability and our ability to collect our receivables. As we grow our revenues and our customer base, our exposure to credit risk increases. In addition, global economic uncertainty, reductions in technology spending in the United\nStates and other countries, and the ongoing challenges in the financial services industry have restricted the availability of capital, which may delay collections from our channel partners beyond our historical experience or may cause companies to file for bankruptcy, jeopardizing the collectability of our receivables from such channel partners and negatively impacting our future results.\nOur channel partner contracts are typically short-term and early termination of these contracts may harm our results of operations.\nWe do not typically enter into long-term contracts with our channel partners, and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our channel partners. In the event of a termination by one of our major channel partners, we believe that the end-user customer would likely purchase from another one of our channel partners, but if this did not occur and we were unable to rapidly replace that revenue source, its loss would harm our results of operations.\nIf our channel partners fail to comply with laws or standards, our business could be harmed.\nWe expect our channel partners to meet certain standards of conduct and to comply with applicable laws, such as global anticorruption laws. Noncompliance with standards or laws could harm our reputation and could result in harm to our business and results of operations in the event we were to become involved in an investigation due to noncompliance by a channel partner.\nWe continue to look for ways to improve and streamline our infrastructure, including implementing a new integrated financial information system and other information technology and processes, and if we do not appropriately manage these implementations, our operating results may be negatively affected.\nTo manage our business effectively, we must continue to improve and streamline our infrastructure, including information technology and processes, financial operating and administrative systems and controls in an efficient manner. We plan to continue to improve our information technology systems and underlying business processes, which will require significant management time, support and cost. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with implementing new systems that may affect our ability to manage our data. If we do not successfully implement, improve or maintain these systems, our operations may be disrupted and our operating results could be harmed. In addition, these systems or their functionality may not operate as we expect them to, and we may be required to expend significant resources to correct problems or find alternative sources for performing these functions, which makes our ability to forecast and effectively control our operating expenses more challenging. For example, as part of our effort to improve efficiencies throughout our worldwide organization, we have begun the implementation of a new integrated financial information system. Implementation of certain financial accounting processes was completed in the third quarter of 2014. The second phase of the implementation is expected to be completed in 2015. The successful conversion from our legacy financial systems to a new integrated financial information system entails a number of risks due to the complexity of the conversion and implementation process. There can be no assurance that the conversion to, and the implementation of, the new financial information system will not impede our ability to receive and process orders and accurately and timely prepare, analyze and report the financial data we use in making operating decisions and which form the basis of the financial information we include in the periodic reports we file with the SEC.\nWe experience seasonal demand for our products and services, which may adversely impact our results of operations during certain periods.\nSales of some of our products have experienced seasonal fluctuations which have affected sequential growth rates for these products, particularly in our first and third quarters. For example, the first quarter of the year is typically the least predictable quarter of the year for us and there is generally a slowdown for sales of our products in the European region in the third quarter of each year. Further, the timing of fiscal year ends for our government and enterprise customers may result in significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter. Seasonal fluctuations could negatively affect our business, which could cause our operating results and cash flows to fall short of anticipated results for such quarters.\nOur operating results are hard to predict as a significant amount of our sales may occur at the end of a quarter and certain of our sales contracts include contractual acceptance provisions.\nThe timing of our channel partner orders and product shipments and our inability to reduce expenses quickly may adversely impact our operating results.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results depend in large part upon the volume and timing of channel partner orders received during a given quarter and the percentage of each order that we are able to ship and recognize as revenue during each quarter, each of which is extremely difficult to forecast. We have experienced longer sales cycles in connection with our high-end UC&C solutions, which could also increase the level of unpredictability and fluctuation in the timing of orders. Further, depending upon the complexity of these solutions, such as immersive telepresence and some UC platform products, and the underlying contractual terms, revenue may not be recognized until the product has been accepted by the end-user, resulting in further revenue unpredictability.\nOur expectations for both short and long-term future revenues are based almost exclusively on our own estimate of future demand and not on firm channel partner orders. Our expense levels are based largely on these estimates. In addition, a significant portion of our product orders are received in the last month of a quarter, typically the last few weeks of that quarter; thus, the unpredictability of the receipt of these orders could negatively impact our future results. For instance, we have experienced a high percentage of our bookings and resulting revenues in the third month of the quarter. For example, in the last four quarters, the percentage of our quarterly revenues that were recognized in the third month of the quarter ranged from approximately 46% to 54%. Accordingly, if for any reason orders and revenues do not meet our expectations in a particular period, we will be limited in our ability to reduce expenses quickly, and any significant shortfall in demand for our products in relation to our expectations would have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nDelays in receiving contractual acceptance will cause delays in our ability to recognize revenue and may impact our quarterly revenues, depending upon the timing and shipment of orders under such contracts.\nCertain of our sales contracts include product acceptance provisions which vary depending upon the type of product and individual terms of the contract. In addition, acceptance criteria may be required in other contracts in the future, depending upon the size and complexity of the sale and the type of products ordered. As we increase our focus on growing our service provider business and cloud and managed services, it is likely that an increased amount of our revenue will be subject to such contractual acceptance terms and milestones, and we may introduce new revenue models that could result in less revenue being recognized upfront. Accordingly, we defer revenue until the underlying acceptance criteria in any given contract have been met. Depending upon the acceptance terms, the timing of the receipt and subsequent shipment of an order may result in acceptance delays, may reduce the predictability of our revenues, and, consequently, may adversely impact our revenues and results of operations in any particular quarter.\nInternational sales and expenses represent a significant portion of our revenues and operating expenses and risks inherent in international operations could harm our business.\nInternational sales and expenses represent a significant portion of our revenues and operating expenses, and we anticipate that international sales and operating expenses will continue to increase. In 2014, international revenues represented 58% of our total revenues. International sales and expenses are subject to certain inherent risks, which would be amplified if our international business grows as anticipated, including the following:\n\u25cf\nadverse economic conditions in international markets, such as the restricted credit environment and sovereign credit concerns in EMEA and the reduced government spending and elongated sales cycles we have seen in China;\n\u25cf\ninformation security, environmental and trade protection measures or sanctions and other legal and regulatory requirements, some of which may affect our ability to import our products, to export our products from, or sell our products in various countries;\n\u25cf\nrecent economic sanctions imposed, and the potential for additional economic sanctions, by the European Union and the U.S. on Russia and certain individuals and entities in Russia, as well as Russia\u2019s potential response to such sanctions, some of which may affect our ability to sell or import our products to Russia;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of government-led initiatives to encourage the purchase of products from domestic vendors, as we have seen in China, which can affect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the United States;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with global anticorruption laws;\n\u25cf\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including the recent volatility of the U.S. dollar, and the impact of our underlying hedging programs;\n\u25cf\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs;\n\u25cf\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u25cf\ncash repatriation restrictions;\n\u25cf\npotentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u25cf\nthe impact of instability in the Middle East or military action or other hostilities on foreign markets, such as the recent events in Russia and the Ukraine.\nInternational revenues may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues in the future as we introduce new products. These fluctuations are primarily the result of our practice of introducing new products in North America first and the additional time and costs required for product homologation and regulatory approvals of new products in international markets. To the extent we are\nunable to expand international sales in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business could be harmed. We may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products.\nTo date, a substantial majority of our international sales have been denominated in U.S. currency, however, we maintain local currency pricing in the European Union and the United Kingdom whereby we price and invoice our products and services in Euros and British Pounds. In addition, some of our competitors currently invoice in foreign currency, which could be a disadvantage to us in those markets where we do not. Our international operating expenses are primarily denominated in foreign currency with no offsetting revenues in those currencies except for the Euro and British Pound. As a result of these factors, we expect our business will be vulnerable to currency fluctuations, which could adversely impact our revenues and margins. We will continue to evaluate whether it is necessary to denominate sales in local currencies other than the Euro and the British Pound, depending on customer requirements.\nWe do not hedge for speculative purposes. As a result of our increased exposure to currency fluctuations, we typically engage in currency hedging activities to mitigate currency fluctuation exposure. Our hedging costs can vary depending upon the size of our hedge program, whether we are purchasing or selling foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar and interest rates spreads between the U.S. and other foreign markets. As a result, interest and other income (expense), net has become less predictable and more difficult to forecast. The impact in any given quarter of our hedging programs is dependent upon a number of factors, including the actual level of foreign currency denominated revenues, the exchange rate in our underlying hedge contracts and the actual exchange rate during the quarter. As a result of our program, we increased operating income by $2.3 million, $2.3 million and $3.7 million in fiscal year 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. For further information on our hedging program, see the section entitled \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nImpairment of our goodwill or other assets would negatively affect our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our goodwill was approximately $559.2 million and other purchased intangible assets were approximately $24.6 million, which together represent a significant portion of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or sooner under certain circumstances. Other intangible assets that are deemed to have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but must be reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist, or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred requires significant judgment. Therefore, we may be required to take a charge to operations as a result of future goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests. The decreases in revenue and stock price that have occurred as a result of global economic factors make such impairment more likely to result. If impairment is deemed to exist, we would write-down the recorded value of these intangible assets to their fair values and these write-downs could harm our business and results of operations. Further, we cannot assure you that future inventory, investment, license, fixed asset or other asset write-downs will not happen. If future write-downs do occur, they could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe have limited supply sources for some key components of our products and services and for the outside development and manufacture of certain of our products, and our operations could be harmed by supply or service interruptions, component defects or unavailability of these components or products.\nSome key components used in our products are currently available from only one source and others are available from only a limited number of sources, including some key integrated circuits and optical elements. Because of such limited sources for component parts, we may have little or no ability to procure these parts on favorable pricing terms. We also obtain certain components from suppliers in China, Japan, and certain Southeast Asia countries, and any political or economic instability in these regions in the future, natural disasters, disruptions associated with infectious diseases, or future import restrictions, may cause delays or an inability to obtain these supplies. Further, we have suppliers in Israel and any military action or war with other Middle Eastern countries perceived as a threat by the United States government may cause delays or an inability to obtain supplies for our UC platform products.\nWe have no raw material supply commitments from our suppliers and generally purchase components on a purchase order basis either directly or through our contract manufacturers. Some of the components included in our products, such as microprocessors and other integrated circuits, have been subject to limited allocations by suppliers. Intellectual property infringement claims against component suppliers could also impact the availability of necessary components for our products. Component manufacturers may also announce the end of production of certain components that we require for our products necessitating the redesign and end of life purchases on our part. In addition, companies with limited or uncertain financial resources manufacture some of these components. Further, we do not always have direct control over the supply chain, as many of our component parts are procured for us by our contract manufacturers. In the event that we, or our contract manufacturers, are unable to obtain sufficient supplies of components, develop alternative sources as needed, or companies with limited financial resources go out of business, our operating results could be seriously harmed. In addition, we may incur additional costs to resolve these supply shortages, which would negatively impact our gross margins.\nWe have strategic relationships with third parties to develop and manufacture certain products for us. The loss of any such strategic relationship due to competitive reasons, contractual disputes, litigation, the financial instability of a strategic partner or their inability to obtain any financing necessary to adequately fund their operations, could have a negative impact on our ability to produce and sell certain products and product lines and, consequently, would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. For example, increasing labor costs in China has increased the risk of bankruptcy for suppliers with operations in China, as well as led to higher manufacturing costs for us and the need to identify alternate suppliers. We are also dependent upon third parties to provide our managed services for our immersive telepresence products. Any disruption in our managed services for our customers may materially adversely affect our ability to sell our immersive telepresence products and impact our relationship with the end users.\nAdditionally, our RealPresence Group Series and Polycom HDX video solutions and network system products are designed based on digital signal processors and integrated circuits produced by Texas Instruments Incorporated, cameras produced by JVC and processors built by Broadcom Corporation. If we could no longer obtain integrated circuits or cameras from these suppliers, we would incur substantial expense and take substantial time in redesigning our products to be compatible with components from other manufacturers, and we might not be successful in obtaining these components from alternative sources in a timely or cost-effective manner. The failure to obtain adequate supplies of vital components could prevent or delay product shipments, which would harm our business. We also rely on the introduction schedules of some key components in the development or launch of new products. Any delays in the availability of these key components could harm our business.\nOur operating results would be seriously harmed by receipt of a significant number of defective components or components that fail to fully comply with environmental or other regulatory requirements, an increase in component prices, or our inability to obtain lower component prices in response to competitive price reductions.\nIf we experience manufacturing disruptions or capacity constraints or our manufacturers fail to comply with laws or standards, our business would be harmed.\nWe subcontract the manufacture of most of our voice, video and network system products to Celestica, Askey, Foxconn and VTech, which are all third-party contract manufacturers. We use Celestica\u2019s facilities in Thailand and China and Askey\u2019s, Foxconn\u2019s, and VTech\u2019s facilities in China. Should there be any disruption in the ability of these third party manufacturers to conduct business for any reason, our business and results of operations would be harmed. While we have begun to develop secondary manufacturing sources for certain products, Celestica\u2019s facilities are currently the manufacturer for substantially all of our video products, and if Celestica experiences an interruption in operations, suffers from capacity constraints, or is otherwise unable to meet our current or future production requirements we would experience a delay or inability to ship our products, which would have an immediate negative impact on our revenues. Moreover, any incapacitation of any of our or our subcontractors\u2019 manufacturing sites due to destruction, natural disaster or similar events could result in a loss of product inventory. As a result of any of the foregoing, we may not be able to meet demand for our products, which could negatively affect revenues in the quarter of the disruption or longer depending upon the magnitude of the event, and could harm our reputation. In addition, operating in the international environment exposes us to certain inherent risks, including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and potentially adverse tax consequences, all of which could harm our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, we expect our contractors to meet certain standards of conduct, including standards related to the environment, health and safety, general working conditions, and compliance with laws. Significant or continuing noncompliance of such standards or applicable laws could harm our reputation or cause us to experience disruptions that could harm our business and results of operations. For example, the SEC has adopted rules imposing diligence and disclosure requirements around the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d in the products we have manufactured. These rules will result in additional time and cost to diligence our contractors and comply with the disclosure requirements and they may also affect the sourcing and availability of minerals we use in our products. Although we do not anticipate any material adverse effects based on these rules, we will need to ensure that our contractors comply with them.\nIf we experience disruptions or capacity constraints in air or ocean transportation, our business would be harmed.\nWe produce most of our subassemblies and finished goods for voice, video and network system products in China and Thailand, and we rely on third parties to transport these subassemblies and finished goods to our global distribution centers and final assembly sites. The incapacitation of any of our freight providers, or any transportation interruption due to airline strikes, dock workers strikes or management lockouts, could negatively affect revenues in the quarter of the disruption or longer, depending on the magnitude of the event.\nCyber attacks on our networks, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, and loss of critical data and proprietary information could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn the current environment, there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. Computer hackers and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services, and systems such as ours, and those of customers, third-parties contractors and vendors, and some of those attempts may be successful. We are not immune to these types of intrusions.\nOur products, services, network systems, and servers may store, process or transmit proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including valuable intellectual property and personal information, of ours and of our employees, customers and other third parties. Our customers rely on our technologies for the secure transmission of such sensitive and confidential information in the conduct of their business. We are also subject to existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices, related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection worldwide.\nAlthough we take cybersecurity seriously and devote significant resources and deploy protective network security tools and devices, data encryption and other security measures to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect our systems, products and data, we have and will continue to experience cyber attacks of varying degrees in the conduct of our business. As a result, our network is subject to unauthorized access, viruses, embedded malware and other malicious software programs. Such intrusions may result in unauthorized access to or disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems, the theft of sensitive or confidential data including intellectual property and business and personal information, system disruptions, access to our financial reporting systems, operational interruptions, product or shipment disruptions or delays, and delays in or cessation of the services we offer.\nAny such breaches or unauthorized access to our networks or to our products or services could ultimately result in significant legal and financial exposure, litigation, regulatory and enforcement action, and loss of valuable company intellectual property. Such breaches could also cause damage to our reputation, impact the market\u2019s perception of us and of the products and services that we offer, and cause an overall loss of confidence in the security of our products and services, resulting in a potentially material adverse effect on our business, revenues and results of operations, as well as customer attrition.\nIn addition, the cost and operational consequences of investigating, remediating, eliminating and putting in place additional information technology (IT) tools and devices designed to prevent actual or perceived security breaches, as well as the costs to comply with any notification obligations resulting from such a breach, could be significant. Further, due to the growing sophistication of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage networks and systems, which change frequently and often are not detected immediately by existing antivirus and other detection tools, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We can make no assurance that we will be able to detect, prevent, timely and adequately address or mitigate such cyber attacks or security breaches.\nOther risks that may result from interruptions to our business due to cyber attacks are discussed in the risk factor entitled \u201cBusiness interruptions could adversely affect our operations.\u201d\nWe have outstanding borrowings under our credit facility, and may incur additional debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $242.2 million in term loans outstanding under our credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). Our indebtedness could have important consequences to our business; for example, it could:\n\u25cf\nrequire us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate;\n\u25cf\nlimit, along with the restrictive covenants contained in the credit agreement, our ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow funds at rates or on other terms we find acceptable;\n\u25cf\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u25cf\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic, financial, industry or competitive conditions, including increases in interest rates.\nIn addition, it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. If new debt is added to current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify.\nOur credit facility contains covenants which may adversely impact our business, and the failure to comply with such covenants could cause our outstanding debt to become immediately payable.\nThe Credit Agreement includes a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict us and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things, grant liens, make investments, incur indebtedness, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make acquisitions, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock, enter into transactions with affiliates and enter into restrictive agreements, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type. We are also required to maintain compliance with a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a consolidated secured leverage ratio. Collectively, these covenants could constrain our ability to grow our business through acquisition or engage in other transactions. In addition, the Credit Agreement includes customary events of default that include, among other things, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, cross default to material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, material judgment defaults, ERISA defaults and a change of control default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the Credit Agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to conduct our business.\nOur failure to successfully implement restructuring plans related to vacant and redundant facilities could adversely impact our business.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, as part of acquiring a company or as part of restructuring actions taken to streamline the business, identify redundant facilities. If we identify redundant facilities, we would develop a plan to exit as part of the integration of the acquired business or as part of the implementation of the restructuring plan. Any reserve would be net of estimated sublease income we expect to generate. Our estimate of sublease income is based on current comparable rates for leases in the respective markets. If actual sublease income is lower than our estimates for any reason, if it takes us longer than we estimated to sublease these facilities, or if the associated cost of, or our recorded liability related to, subleasing or terminating our lease obligations for these facilities is greater than we estimated, we would incur additional charges to operations which would harm our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanging laws and increasingly complex corporate governance and public disclosure requirements could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards, including those relating to corporate governance, social/environmental responsibility, import and export requirements, data privacy, global anticorruption and public disclosure and newly enacted SEC regulations, have created additional compliance requirements for us. Our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in an increase in expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time from other business activities. While we believe we are compliant with laws and regulations in jurisdictions where we do business, we must continue to monitor and assess our compliance in the future, and we must also continue to expand our compliance procedures. For example, although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with global anticorruption laws, our employees, channel partners, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any failures in these procedures in the future, even if prohibited by our policies, could result in time-consuming and costly activities, potential fines and penalties, and diversion of management time, all of which could hurt our business.\nOur products and services are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations. Compliance with current laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition. However, new laws and regulations or new or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations could deny or delay our access to certain markets or require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe telecommunications industry is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States and similar government agencies in other countries and is subject to changing political, economic, and regulatory influences. Changes in telecommunications requirements, or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate now or in the future, in the United States or other countries could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, including our managed services offering. Further, changes in the regulation of our activities, such as increased or decreased regulation affecting prices, could also have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations.\nIf we have insufficient proprietary rights or if we fail to protect those rights we have, our business could be materially impaired.\nWe rely on third-party license agreements and termination or impairment of these agreements may cause delays or reductions in product introductions or shipments which could harm our business.\nWe have licensing agreements with various suppliers for software incorporated into our products. In addition, certain of our products are developed and manufactured based largely or solely on third-party technology. These third-party software licenses and\narrangements may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable or competitive terms, if at all. The termination or impairment of these licenses could result in delays or reductions in new product introductions or current product shipments until equivalent software could be developed, licensed and integrated, which could harm our business and results of operations. Further, if we are unable to obtain necessary technology licenses on commercially reasonable or competitive terms, we could be prohibited from marketing our products, forced to market products without certain features, or incur substantial costs to redesign our products, defend legal actions, or pay damages. In addition, some of our products may include \u201copen source\u201d software. Our ability to commercialize products or technologies incorporating open source software may be restricted because, among other factors, open source license terms may be unclear and may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our product offerings.\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets to protect our proprietary rights which may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our proprietary rights. Others may independently develop similar proprietary information and techniques or gain access to our intellectual property rights or disclose such technology. In addition, we cannot assure you that any patent or registered trademark owned by us will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the U.S. or foreign countries or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us, if at all. Furthermore, others may develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents. In addition, foreign intellectual property laws may not protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity of and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could harm our business, and we could ultimately be unsuccessful in protecting our intellectual property rights. Further, our intellectual property protection controls across our global operations may not be adequate to fully protect us from the theft or misappropriation of our intellectual property, which could adversely harm our business.\nWe face litigation claims that might be costly to resolve and, if resolved adversely, may harm our operating results or financial condition.\nWe are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. The results of, and costs associated with, complex litigation matters are difficult to predict, and the uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved lawsuits could harm our business, financial condition, and reputation. Negative developments with respect to pending lawsuits could cause our stock price to decline, and an unfavorable resolution of any particular lawsuit could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we may become involved in regulatory investigations or other governmental or private legal proceedings, which could be distracting, expensive and time consuming for us, and if public, may also cause our stock price to be negatively impacted. We expect that the number and significance of claims and legal proceedings that assert patent infringement claims or other intellectual property rights covering our products, either directly against us or against our customers, will increase as our business expands. Any claims or proceedings against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements or pay amounts to third parties pursuant to contractual indemnity provisions. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. In addition, we expect that we may face legal proceedings for matters unrelated to intellectual property. For example, in 2013 a purported shareholder class action suit and shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors. Such shareholder activities or lawsuits, and any related publicity, may result in substantial costs and, among other things, divert the attention of management and our employees. An unfavorable outcome in any claim or proceeding against us could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs, and potentially in future periods. Further, any settlement announced by us may expose us to further claims against us by third parties seeking monetary or other damages which, even if unsuccessful, would divert management attention from the business and cause us to incur costs, possibly material, to defend such matters.\nDifficulties in identifying and integrating acquisitions could adversely affect our business.\nWe have spent and may spend in the future, significant resources identifying and acquiring businesses. The process of identifying suitable candidates and integrating acquired companies into our operations requires significant resources and is time-consuming, expensive and disruptive to our business. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions could harm our business, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we may incur material charges in future quarters to reflect additional costs associated with any future acquisition we may make. We may not realize the benefits we anticipate from our acquisitions because of the following significant challenges:\n\u25cf\nincorporating the acquired company\u2019s technology and products and services into our current and future product lines, including providing services that are new for us;\n\u25cf\npotential deterioration of the acquired company\u2019s product sales and revenues due to integration activities and management distraction;\n\u25cf\nmanaging integration issues;\n\u25cf\npotentially creating confusion in the marketplace by ineffectively distinguishing or marketing the product and services offerings of the newly acquired company with our existing product and services lines;\n\u25cf\nentering new businesses or product lines;\n\u25cf\npotentially incompatible cultural differences between the two companies;\n\u25cf\ngeographic dispersion of operations;\n\u25cf\ninterruption of manufacturing operations as we transition an acquired company\u2019s manufacturing to our outsourced manufacturing model;\n\u25cf\ngenerating marketing demand for an expanded product line;\n\u25cf\ndistraction of the existing and acquired sales force during the integration of the companies;\n\u25cf\ndistraction of and potential conflict with the acquired company\u2019s products and services in regards to our existing channel partners;\n\u25cf\nthe difficulty in leveraging the combined technologies and capabilities across all product lines and customer bases; and\n\u25cf\nretaining the customers or employees of an acquired company.\nIf we fail to manage our exposure to the volatility and economic uncertainty in the global financial marketplace successfully, our operating results could be adversely impacted.\nWe are exposed to financial risk associated with the global financial markets, which includes volatility in interest rates, uncertainty in the credit markets and instability in the foreign currency exchange market. Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our term loan debt facility. The valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Factors that may impact its valuation include changes to credit ratings or quality of the securities, interest rate changes, the ongoing strength and quality of the global credit market and liquidity. All of the securities in our investment portfolio are investment-grade rated, but the instability of the credit market could impact those ratings and our decision to hold these securities, if they do not meet our minimum credit rating requirements. If we should decide to sell such securities, we may suffer losses in principal value that have significantly declined in value due to the declining credit rating of the securities and the ongoing strength and the global financial markets as a whole. The interest rate on our term loan debt facility is based upon LIBOR and to the extent that LIBOR interest rates increase, our annual interest expense on this term loan debt will increase. With the instability in the financial markets, we could incur significant realized or other than temporary impairment losses associated with certain of our investments which would reduce our net income. We may also incur temporary impairment charges requiring us to record an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income. For more information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates, see the section entitled \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nDelays or loss of government contracts or failure to obtain required government certifications could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe sell our products indirectly and provide services to governmental entities in accordance with certain regulated contractual arrangements. While reporting and compliance with government contracts is both our responsibility and the responsibility of our partner, a lack of reporting or compliance by us or our partners could have an impact on the sales of our products to government agencies. Further, the United States Federal government has certain certification and product requirements for products sold to them. If we are unable to meet applicable certification or other requirements within the timeframes specified by the United States Federal government, or if our competitors have certifications for competitive products for which we are not yet certified, our revenues and results of operations would be adversely impacted.\nChanges in our tax rates could adversely affect our future results.\nWe are a U.S. based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates, which are difficult to predict, could be unfavorably affected by changes in, or interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, by lapses of the availability of\nthe U.S. research and development tax credit, which occurred for 2014 but was reinstated on December 19, 2014 as part of the \"Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014.\" Further, the accounting for stock compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718 and uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 could result in more unpredictability and variability to our future effective tax rates.\nWe are also subject to the periodic examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and currently are under examination in a few foreign jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We may underestimate the outcome of such examinations which, if significant, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nBusiness interruptions could adversely affect our operations.\nOur operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, or other natural disaster, quarantines or other disruptions associated with infectious diseases, national catastrophe, terrorist activities, war, ongoing disturbances in the Middle East, an attack on Israel, disruptions in our computing and communications infrastructure due to power loss, telecommunications failure, human error, physical or electronic security breaches and computer viruses (which could leave us vulnerable to the loss of our intellectual property or the confidential information of our customers, disruption of our business activities and potential litigation), and other events beyond our control. We have a business continuity program that is based on enterprise risk assessment which addresses the impact of natural, technological, man-made and geopolitical disasters on our critical business functions. This plan helps facilitate the continuation of critical business activities in the event of a disaster but may not prove to be sufficient. In addition, our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur, and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, given our linearity, any interruption of our business, business processes or systems late in a fiscal quarter could potentially negatively impact our financial results or financial reporting for such period.\nIn the case of our managed services business, any circuit failure or downtime could affect a significant portion of our customers. Since our ability to attract and retain customers depends on our ability to provide customers with highly reliable service, even minor interruptions could harm our reputation, require that we incur additional expense to acquire alternative telecommunications capacity, or cause us to miss contractual obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our business.\nOur cash flow could fluctuate due to the potential difficulty of collecting our receivables and managing our inventories.\nOver the past few years, we have made significant investments in EMEA and APAC to expand our business in these regions. In EMEA and APAC, as with other international regions, credit terms are typically longer than in the United States. Therefore, as Europe, APAC and other international regions grow as a percentage of our revenues, accounts receivable balances increase and our days-sales-outstanding increase. Although from time to time we have been able to largely offset the effects of these influences through additional incentives offered to channel partners at the end of each quarter in the form of prepay discounts, these additional incentives have lowered our profitability. In addition, economic uncertainty or a downturn in technology spending in the United States and other countries could restrict the availability of capital, which may delay our collections from our channel partners beyond our historical experience or may cause companies to file for bankruptcy. Either a delay in collections or bankruptcy would harm our cash flow and accounts receivable day\u2019s outstanding performance.\nIn addition, as we manage our business and focus on more cost effective shipment lead times for certain of our products and implement freight cost reduction programs, our inventory levels may increase, resulting in decreased inventory turns that could negatively impact our cash flow. We believe inventory turns will continue to fluctuate depending upon our ability to reduce lead times, as well as due to changes in anticipated product demand and product mix and the mix of ocean freight versus air freight.\nOur stock price is volatile and fluctuates as a result of the conduct of our business and stock market.\nThe market price of our common stock has from time to time experienced significant fluctuations. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nstatements or changes in opinions, ratings or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the market in which we do business, including competitors, partners, suppliers or telecommunications industry leaders or relating to us specifically;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our executive team or speculation in the press or the investment community about changes;\n\u25cf\nthe announcement of new products, product enhancements or acquisitions by us or by our competitors;\n\u25cf\ntechnological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nquarterly variations in our results of operations;\n\u25cf\nfailure of our future operating results to meet expectations of stock market analysts or investors, which is inherently subject to greater risk and uncertainty as expectations increase, or any financial guidance we may provide to the market;\n\u25cf\ngeneral market conditions or market conditions specific to technology industries; and\n\u25cf\ndomestic and international macroeconomic factors.\nWe have experienced volatility in our stock price, which sometimes results in attempts by shareholders to involve themselves in the governance and strategic direction of a company above and apart from normal interactions between shareholders and management. In addition, class action litigation is sometimes instituted following periods of volatility. Such shareholder activities or lawsuits, and any related publicity, may result in substantial costs and, among other things, divert the attention of management and our employees.\nWe are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSection 404\u201d), we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. Such report contains, among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. While we were able to assert in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014, we must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our control framework may suffer if we are unable to adapt our control framework appropriately as we continue to grow our business. If we are unable to assert in any future reporting period that our internal control over financial reporting is effective (or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls), we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have an adverse effect on our stock price.", "PERMNO": 83405, "SIC": 3661, "TIC": "PLCM"}
