{"cik": "811240", "company": "BIOLASE, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors together with all of the other information included in this Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently consider to be immaterial could also adversely affect us. If any of the following risks come to fruition, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves substantial risks. You should carefully consider the following risk factors before making an investment decision. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently consider to be immaterial could also adversely affect us. If any of those risks or uncertainties come to fruition, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nThe novel coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, similar risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks or pandemics may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, including the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus and the disease caused by it, COVID-19. During 2020, the spread of the novel coronavirus has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets. If such disruption and volatility recurs, there could be an increase our cost of capital and an adverse effect on our ability to access the capital markets. In addition, efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic have led to travel restrictions, prohibitions on public gatherings and closures of dental offices and clinics throughout much of Europe and the United States. The ability of our salespeople to call on dental customers during these closures were greatly limited. In addition, most dental shows and workshops scheduled in 2020 were canceled. As a result of reduced sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to contain it, cash generated from our operations during 2020 were negatively impacted. The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve and the full magnitude that the pandemic may have on our financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations remains uncertain. There is no assurance that sales will return to normal levels during 2021 or at any time thereafter.\nWe have experienced net losses for each of the past three years and we could experience additional losses and have difficulty achieving profitability in the future.\nWe had an accumulated deficit of $251.4 million at December 31, 2020. We recorded net losses of $16.8 million, $17.9 million, and $21.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. In order to achieve profitability, we must increase net revenue through new sales and control our costs. Failure to increase our net revenue and decrease our costs could cause our stock price to decline and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are vulnerable to continued global economic uncertainty and volatility in financial markets.\nOur business is highly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions as a seller of capital equipment to end users in dental professional practices. Financial markets inside the United States and internationally have experienced extreme disruption in recent times, including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, and declining valuations of investments. We believe these disruptions are likely to have an ongoing adverse effect on the world economy. A continuing economic downturn and financial market disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and if we are unable to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us, we could be unable to execute our business plan.\nAs a result of reduced sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to contain it, we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities in the public or private markets, or through a collaborative arrangement or sale of assets. Additional financing opportunities may not be available to us, or if available, may not be on favorable terms. The availability of financing opportunities will depend, in part, on market conditions, and the outlook for our business. Any future issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders, and the securities issued in such a financing could have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. In addition, if we raise additional funds through debt financing, we could be subject to debt covenants that place limitations on our operations. We could not be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms, or at all, or we could use capital more rapidly than anticipated. If we cannot raise the required capital when needed, we may not be able to satisfy the demands of existing and prospective customers, we could lose revenue and market share and we may have to curtail our capital expenditures.\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future, we could have to curtail our capital expenditures. Any curtailment of our capital expenditures could result in a reduction in net revenue, reduced quality of our products, increased manufacturing costs for our products, harm to our reputation, or reduced manufacturing efficiencies and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, on our relationships with, and the efforts of, third-party distributors.\nWe rely on exclusive and non-exclusive third-party distributors for a portion of our sales in North America and a majority of our sales in countries outside of the U.S. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, revenue from distributors accounted for approximately 29%, 33%, and 34% of our total net revenue, respectively. Our distributors have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources they apply to the sale of our products, and we face significant challenges and risks in expanding, training, and managing our third-party distributors, particularly given their geographically dispersed operations. Our distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations, and, regardless of the resources they commit, they may not be successful. From time to time, we may face competition or pricing pressure from one or more of our non-exclusive distributors in certain geographic areas where those distributors are selling inventory to the same customer base as us. Additionally, most of our distributor agreements can be terminated with limited notice, and we may not be able to replace any terminating distributor in a timely manner or on terms agreeable to us, if at all. If we are not able to maintain our distribution network, if our distribution network is not successful in marketing and selling our products, or if we experience a significant reduction in, cancellation, or change in the size and timing of orders from our distributors, our revenues could decline significantly and lead to an inability to meet operating cash flow requirements, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDentists and patients have been hesitant in adopting laser technologies, and our inability to overcome this hesitation could limit the market acceptance of our products and our market share.\nOur dental laser systems represent relatively new technologies in the dental market. Only a small percentage of dentists use lasers to perform dental procedures. Our future success will depend on our ability to increase demand for our products by demonstrating to a broad spectrum of dentists and patients the potential performance advantages of our laser systems over traditional methods of treatment and over competitive laser systems, and our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Historically, we have experienced long sales cycles because dentists have been, and could continue to be, slow to adopt new technologies on a widespread basis. As a result, we generally are required to invest a significant amount of time and resources to educate dentists about the benefits of our products in comparison to competing products and technologies before completing a sale, if any.\nAny failure in our efforts to train dental practitioners could result in the misuse of our products, reduce the market acceptance of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThere is a learning process involved for dental practitioners to become proficient users of our laser systems. It is critical to the success of our sales efforts to adequately train a sufficient number of dental practitioners. Following completion of training, we rely on the trained dental practitioners to advocate the benefits of our products in the broader marketplace. Convincing dental practitioners to dedicate the time and energy necessary for adequate training is challenging, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in these efforts. If dental practitioners are not properly trained, they could misuse or ineffectively use our products, or could be less likely to appreciate our laser systems. This could also result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes, patient injury, negative publicity, FDA regulatory action, or lawsuits against us, any of which could negatively affect our reputation and sales of our laser systems.\nIf future data proves to be inconsistent with our clinical results or if competitors\u2019 products present more favorable results our revenues could decline and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf new studies or comparative studies generate results that are not as favorable as our clinical results, our revenues could decline. Additionally, if future studies indicate that our competitors\u2019 products are more effective or safer than ours, our revenues could decline. Furthermore, dental practitioners could choose not to purchase our laser systems until they receive additional published long-term clinical evidence and recommendations from prominent dental practitioners that indicate our laser systems are effective for dental applications.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards could be limited.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (\u201cIRC\u201d) generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone material changes in its stock ownership. In 2006, we completed an analysis to determine the applicability of the annual limitations imposed by IRC Section 382 caused by previous changes in our stock ownership and determined that such limitations should not be significant. Given our continued generation of losses since the completion of 2006 study, we have not updated the study. However, we plan to update the study if we expect to utilize net operating loss carryforwards in any future year. If we experience an ownership change as defined in IRC Section 382, utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards, research and development credit carryforwards, and other tax attributes, would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the IRC. In addition, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards, research and development credit carryforwards, and other tax attributes may be limited by other changes outside our control, such as changes to applicable tax law. Any limitation may result in the expiration of a portion of the net operating loss or research and development credit carryforwards before utilization. If we lose our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards, any income we generate will be subject to tax earlier than it would be if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards, resulting in lower profits which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe could incur problems in manufacturing our products.\nIn order to grow our business, we must expand our manufacturing capabilities to produce the systems and accessories necessary to meet any demand we may experience. We could encounter difficulties in increasing the production of our products, including problems involving production capacity and yields, quality control and assurance, component supply, and shortages of qualified personnel. In addition, before we can begin commercial manufacture of our products, we must ensure our manufacturing facilities, processes, and quality systems, and the manufacture of our laser systems, comply with FDA regulations governing facility compliance, quality control, and documentation policies and procedures. In addition, our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, as well as various state agencies and foreign regulatory agencies. From time to time, we could expend significant resources in obtaining, maintaining, and addressing our compliance with these requirements. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to manufacture our products in compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation and other regulatory requirements. We have experienced quality issues with components of our products supplied by third parties, and we could continue to do so. Our future success depends on our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis with acceptable manufacturing costs, while at the same time maintaining good quality control and complying with applicable regulatory requirements, and an inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, cash collections from customers, and our ability to meet operating cash flow requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to significant warranty obligations if our products are defective, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn manufacturing our products, we depend upon third parties for the supply of various components. Many of these components require a significant degree of technical expertise to design and produce. If we fail to adequately design, or if our suppliers fail to produce components to specification, or if the suppliers, or we, use defective materials or workmanship in the manufacturing process, the reliability and performance of our products will be compromised. We have experienced such non-compliance with manufacturing specifications in the past and could continue to experience such non-compliance in the future, which could lead to higher costs and reduced margins.\nOur products could contain defects that cannot be repaired easily and inexpensively, and we have experienced in the past and could experience in the future some or all of the following:\n\u2022\nloss of customer orders and delay in order fulfillment;\n\u2022\ndamage to our brand reputation;\n\u2022\nincreased cost of our warranty program due to product repair or replacement;\n\u2022\ninability to attract new customers;\n\u2022\ndiversion of resources from our manufacturing and engineering and development departments into our service department; and\n\u2022\nlegal action.\nProduct liability claims against us could be costly and could harm our reputation.\nThe sale of dental and medical devices involves the risk of product liability claims against us. Claims could exceed our product liability insurance coverage limits. Our insurance policies are subject to various standard coverage exclusions, including damage to the product itself, losses from recall of our product, and losses covered by other forms of insurance such as workers compensation. We cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully defend any claims against us, nor can we be certain that our insurance will cover all liabilities resulting from such claims. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain such insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, any product liability claim brought against us could result in harm to our reputation, decreased demand for our products, costs related to litigation, product recalls, loss of revenue, an increase in our product liability insurance rates, or the inability to secure coverage in the future, and could have a material adverse effect on our business by reducing cash collections from customers and limiting our ability to meet our operating cash flow requirements.\nOur suppliers may not supply us with a sufficient amount or adequate quality of materials, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business depends on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of materials, components, and subassemblies of acceptable quality and in acceptable quantities from third-party suppliers. We generally purchase components and subassemblies from a limited group of suppliers through purchase orders, rather than written supply contracts. Consequently, many of our suppliers have no obligation to continue to supply us on a long-term basis. In addition, our suppliers manufacture products for a range of customers, and fluctuations in demand for the products those suppliers manufacture for others could affect their ability to deliver components for us in a timely manner. Moreover, our suppliers could encounter financial hardships, be acquired, or experience other business events unrelated to our demand for components, which could inhibit or prevent their ability to fulfill our orders and satisfy our requirements.\nCertain components of our products, particularly specialized components used in our laser systems, are currently available only from a single source or limited sources. For example, the crystal, fiber, and hand pieces used in our Waterlase systems are each supplied by a separate single supplier. Our dependence on single-source suppliers involves several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality, and delivery schedules.\nIf any of our suppliers cease to provide us with sufficient quantities of our components in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us, or ceases to manufacture components of acceptable quality, we could incur manufacturing delays and sales disruptions while we locate and engage alternative qualified suppliers, and we might be unable to engage acceptable alternative suppliers on favorable terms. In addition, we could need to reengineer our components, which could require product redesign and submission to the FDA of a 510(k) application, which could significantly delay production. Any interruption or delay in the supply of components or materials, or our inability to obtain components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to cancel orders or switch to competitive procedures. We are continually in the process of identifying and qualifying alternate source suppliers for our key components. There can be no assurance, however, that we will successfully identify and qualify an alternate source supplier for any of our key components or that we could enter into an agreement with any such alternate source supplier on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe have significant international sales and are subject to risks associated with operating internationally.\nInternational sales comprise a significant portion of our net revenue, and we intend to continue to pursue and expand our international business activities. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, international sales accounted for approximately 29%, 40%, and 38% of our net revenue, respectively. Political, economic, and health conditions outside the United States, could make it difficult for us to increase our international revenue or to operate abroad. For example, efforts to contain the outbreak of COVID-19 in Asia and Europe included travel restrictions and closures of dental offices and clinics, significantly adversely impacting our international sales in the first quarter of 2020.\nIn addition, international operations are subject to many inherent risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating cash flow, including among others:\n\u2022\nadverse changes in tariffs and trade restrictions;\n\u2022\npolitical, social, and economic instability and increased security concerns;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nlonger collection periods and difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities;\n\u2022\nexposure to different legal standards;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and difficulties of managing international distribution channels;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for our intellectual property in some countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining domestic and foreign export, import, and other governmental approvals, permits, and licenses, and compliance with foreign laws;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of governmental controls;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory or certification requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; and\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences and the complexities of foreign value-added tax systems.\nWe believe that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue, and we intend to expand our international operations further. In international markets where our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, an increase in the relative value of the dollar against the currency in such markets could indirectly increase the price of our products in those markets and result in a decrease in sales. We do not currently engage in any transactions as a hedge against risks of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations. However, we could do so in the future.\nWe could be subject to breaches of our information technology systems, which could damage our reputation and customer relationships. Such breaches could subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences.\nWe rely on information systems (\u201cIS\u201d) in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data. A cyber-attack that bypasses our IS security, or employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions that cause an IS security breach could lead to a material disruption of our IS and/or the loss of business information. Such an attack could result in, among other things: the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data and intellectual property; operational or business delays; liability for a breach of personal financial and health information belonging to our customers and their patients or to our employees; and damage to our reputation.\nAny of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business due to the time and expense to respond to such an attack, recover data, and remediate IS weaknesses, which would disrupt our daily business operations. Further, in the event of an attack, we would be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, including under laws that protect the privacy of personal information.\nOur revenue and operating results fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors, so you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance.\nOur revenue typically fluctuates from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Revenue in the first quarter typically is lower than average, and revenue in the fourth quarter typically is stronger than average due to the buying patterns of dental practitioners. We believe that this trend exists because a significant number of dentists purchase their capital equipment towards the end of the calendar year in order to maximize their practice earnings while seeking to minimize their taxes. They often use certain tax incentives, such as accelerated depreciation methods for purchasing capital equipment, as part of their year-end tax planning. In addition, revenue in the third quarter could be affected by vacation patterns, which can cause revenue to be flat or lower than in the second quarter of the year. Our historical seasonal fluctuations could also be impacted by sales promotions used by large dental distributors that encourage end-of-quarter and end-of-year buying in our industry.\nThe expenses we incur are based, in large part, on our expectations regarding future net revenue. Since many of our costs are fixed in the short term, we could be unable to reduce expenses quickly enough to avoid losses if we experience a decrease in expected net revenue. Accordingly, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance.\nLitigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are from time to time involved in various claims, litigation matters and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business, including claims for damages arising out of the use of our products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, commercial disputes, competition, sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, and insurance coverage. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages. The defense of these lawsuits could divert our management\u2019s attention, and we could incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we could be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to unfavorable equitable remedies. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we could have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures.\nOur manufacturing operations are consolidated primarily in one facility. A disruption at this facility could result in a prolonged interruption of our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSubstantially all of our manufacturing operations are located at our facility in Corona, California, which is near known earthquake fault zones. Although we have taken precautions to safeguard our facilities including disaster recovery planning and off-site backup of computer data, a natural disaster such as an earthquake, fire, or flood, could seriously harm our facility and significantly disrupt our operations. Additionally, labor disputes, maintenance requirements, power outages, equipment failures, civil unrest, or terrorist attacks affecting our Corona, California facility could significantly disrupt our operations. Our business interruption insurance coverage may not cover all or any of our losses from natural disasters or other disruptions.\nIf we lose our key management personnel, or are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel, it could adversely affect our ability to execute our growth strategy.\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon our ability to hire and retain management, engineers, marketing and sales personnel, and technical, research and other personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing employment opportunities. Our success will depend on our ability to retain our current personnel and to attract and retain qualified like personnel in the future. Competition for senior management, engineers, marketing and sales personnel, and other specialized technicians is intense and we may not be able to retain our personnel. If we lose the services of any executive officers or key employees, our ability to achieve our business objectives could be harmed or delayed, which could have a material adverse effect on our daily operations, operating cash flows, results of operations, and ultimately share price. In general, our officers could terminate their employment at any time without notice for any reason.\nFailure to meet covenants in the Credit Agreements with our debt agreements could result in acceleration of our payment obligations thereunder, and we may not be able to find alternative financing.\nUnder the Credit Agreement dated November 9, 2018, as amended from time to time, between BIOLASE, Inc. and SWK, we are required to maintain a specified amount of consolidated unencumbered liquid assets as of the end of each fiscal quarter, generate minimum levels of revenue as of the end of each period specified in the Credit Agreement and maintain specified levels of consolidated EBITDA as of the end of each period specified in the Credit Agreement. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by factors beyond our control.\nIf we fail to comply with the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement or if the Required Lenders (as defined in the Credit Agreement) contend that we have failed to comply with these covenants or any other restrictions, it could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement, which would permit or, in certain events, require SWK to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable. There can be no assurances that we will be able to repay all such amounts or able to find alternative financing in an event of a default. Even if alternative financing is available in an event of a default under the Credit Agreement, it may be on unfavorable terms, and the interest rate charged on any new borrowings could be substantially higher than the interest rate under the Credit Agreement, thus adversely affecting cash flows, results of operations, and ultimately, our ability to meet operating cash flow requirements.\nThe restrictive covenants in the Credit Agreement and the PMB Loan Agreement (as defined below) and BIOLASE\u2019s obligation to make debt payments under these loans may limit our operating and financial flexibility and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Credit Agreement imposes operating and financial restrictions and covenants, which may limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake investments, including acquisitions;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake dividends, distributions or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\neffect affiliate transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into mergers, divisions, consolidations or sales of substantially all of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 assets;\n\u2022\nchange business activities and issue equity interests; or\n\u2022\nsell material assets (without using the proceeds thereof to repay the obligations under the Credit Agreement).\nIn addition, we are required to comply with certain financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as described above.\nSuch restrictive covenants in the Credit Agreement and our loan and security agreement (the \u201cPMB Loan Agreement\u201d) with Pacific Mercantile Bank (\u201cPMB\u201d) and our repayment obligations under the Credit Agreement could have adverse consequences to us, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to use cash;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in operating our business and planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u2022\nrequiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interests on, the indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund our operations, working capital, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.\nIf we fail to comply with the terms of the Credit Agreement and there is an event of default, the creditor(s) may foreclose upon the assets securing our obligations thereunder.\nTo secure the performance of our obligations under the Credit Agreement, we granted SWK security interests in substantially all of the assets of BIOLASE and certain of our foreign and domestic subsidiaries. In addition, the loan under the PMB Loan Agreement (the \u201cPMB Loan\u201d) is secured by substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets. Our failure to comply with the terms of the Credit Agreement could result in an event of default thereunder. In that event, SWK will have the option to (and, in certain circumstances, will have the obligation to) foreclose on the assets of BIOLASE and certain of our subsidiaries pledged as collateral under the Credit Agreement or the other documents executed in connection with the Credit Agreement. The foreclosure on the Company\u2019s assets could severely and negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf certain individuals (or permitted replacements thereof) no longer serve as our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, we may be obligated to pay all outstanding obligations and certain fees under our debt agreements.\nThe Credit Agreement provides that, unless such actions are consented to in advance in writing by SWK, if two or more of the three of Jonathan Lord, Todd Norbe and John Beaver (or, in each case, his approved successor) at any one time no longer serves in their current positions with the Company and we do not find individuals to replace such individuals within 150 days (or in certain circumstances 210 days), with individuals of appropriate qualification and experience approved in writing by SWK (which approval may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), there is a \u201cKey Person Event\u201d and all outstanding obligations and certain fees under the Credit Agreement become immediately due and payable. Similarly, under the PMB Loan, if our President, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer is changed and not replaced with another person acceptable to PMB as one of our lenders, within 20 days of such change, there would be an event of default under the PMB Loan Agreement. Mr. Norbe resigned as President and Chief Executive Officer on February 22, 2021. Whether Mr. Lord and Mr. Beaver remain our Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, is not entirely under our control. Although we intend to find an appropriate replacement satisfactory to the applicable lender for Mr. Norbe and if either of Mr. Lord or Mr. Beaver leaves his current position, there is no assurance that we will be able find a replacement acceptable to the applicable lender within the time period permitted, if at all. If there is a Key Person Event or an event of default under the PMB Loan Agreement, there can be no assurance that we will be able to repay all outstanding obligations and fees payable or able to find alternative financing. Even if alternative financing is available, it may be on unfavorable terms, and the interest rate charged on any new borrowings could be substantially higher than the interest rate under our current agreements, thus adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with the reporting obligations of the Exchange Act and Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if we fail to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and investors\u2019 confidence in us, could be materially and adversely affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the periodic reporting obligations of the Exchange Act, including preparing annual reports, quarterly reports, and current reports. Our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner and meet our reporting obligations in their entirety could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d), expose us to lawsuits, and restrict our ability to access financing on favorable terms, or at all.\nIn addition, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to evaluate and provide a management report of our systems of internal control over financial reporting. During the course of the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, we could identify areas requiring improvement and could be required to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review. This could result in significant delays and costs to us and require us to divert substantial resources, including management time, from other activities.\nIn 2019, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, specifically, our controls relating to the accounting for our Series E Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries E Preferred Stock\u201d). During our review of the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2019, we determined that the classification of the Series E Preferred Stock on the consolidated balance sheet was incorrect and that due to the fact that the Series E Preferred Stock is redeemable at the control of the stockholder, it should have been classified as mezzanine equity pursuant to the accounting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 480 - \u201cDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity,\u201d and not a component of permanent equity. We believe that these control deficiencies were a result of and misinterpretation of the terms and conditions of the Preferred Stock Agreement which led to the misclassification. The error was corrected and the material weakness did not result in any identified misstatements to the financial statements, and there were no changes to previously released financial results. Based on this material weakness, the Company\u2019s management concluded that at December 31, 2019, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was not effective.\nAlthough the material weakness has been remediated as of December 31, 2020, any failure to maintain compliance with the requirements of Section 404 on a timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could, negatively impact the trading price of our stock, and adversely affect investors\u2019 confidence in the Company and our ability to access capital markets for financing.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf the patents that we own or license, or our other intellectual property rights, do not adequately protect our technologies, we could lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and technology, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the intellectual property of others. We rely on patents to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. We currently possess a number of issued patents and patent applications with respect to our products and technology. However, we cannot ensure that any additional patents will be issued, that the scope of any patent protection will be effective in helping us address our competition, or that any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged. It is also possible that our competitors could independently develop similar or more desirable products, duplicate our products, or design products that circumvent our patents. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. In addition, there have been recent changes in the patent laws and rules of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and there could be future proposed changes that, if enacted, have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitive position could be adversely affected, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights, we could incur liabilities and costs and have to redesign or discontinue selling certain products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe face substantial uncertainty regarding the impact that other parties\u2019 intellectual property positions will have on dental and other medical laser applications. The medical technology industry has in the past been characterized by a substantial amount of litigation and related administrative proceedings regarding patents and intellectual property rights. From time to time, we have received, and we expect to continue to receive, notices of claims of infringement, misappropriation, or misuse of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. Some of these claims could lead to litigation. We may not prevail in any future intellectual property infringement litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in litigation. Any claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and distracting to management, result in costly litigation, or cause product shipment delays. Adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liability and could result in the loss of proprietary rights. A successful lawsuit against us could also force us to cease selling or redesign products that incorporate the infringed intellectual property. Additionally, we could be required to seek a license from the holder of the intellectual property to use the infringed technology, and we may not be able to obtain a license on acceptable terms, or at all.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory Environment\nChanges in government regulation or the inability to obtain or maintain necessary government approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur products are subject to extensive government regulation, both in the United States and in other countries. To clinically test, manufacture, and market products for human use, we must comply with regulations and safety standards set by the FDA and comparable state and foreign agencies. Regulations adopted by the FDA are wide-ranging and govern, among other things, product design, development, manufacture and control testing, labeling control, storage, advertising, and sales. Generally, products must meet regulatory standards as safe and effective for their intended use before being marketed for human applications. The clearance process is expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements of the FDA can result in an enforcement action, which could include a variety of sanctions, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of our products, operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production and criminal prosecution. The failure to receive or maintain requisite approvals for the use of our products or processes, or significant delays in obtaining such approvals, could prevent us from developing, manufacturing, and marketing products and services necessary for us to remain competitive.\nIf we develop new products and applications or make any significant modifications to our existing products or labeling, we will need to obtain additional regulatory clearances or approvals. Any modification that could significantly affect a product\u2019s safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a change in its intended use, will require a new FDA 510(k) clearance, or could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer\u2019s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer\u2019s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained. If 510(k) clearance is denied and a PMA application is required, we could be required to submit substantially more data and conduct human clinical testing and would very likely be subject to a significantly longer review period.\nProducts sold in international markets are also subject to the regulatory requirements of each respective country or region. The regulations of the European Union require that a device have a CE Mark, indicating conformance with European Union laws and regulations before it can be sold in the European Union. The regulatory international review process varies from country to country. We rely on our distributors and sales representatives in the foreign countries in which we market our products to comply with the regulatory laws of such countries. Failure to comply with the laws of such countries could prevent us from continuing to sell products in such countries. In addition, unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or the adoption of new requirements could impose significant costs and burdens on us, which could increase our operating expenses.\nChanges in health care regulations in the U.S. and elsewhere could adversely affect the demand for our products as well as the way in which we conduct our business. For example, in 2010, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, which included various reforms impacting Medicare coverage and reimbursement, including revision to prospective payment systems, any of which could adversely impact any Medicare reimbursements received by our end-user customers. New legislation may be enacted as President Trump and Congress consider further reform. In addition, as a result of the focus on health care reform, there is risk that Congress could implement changes in laws and regulations governing health care service providers, including measures to control costs, and reductions in reimbursement levels. We cannot be sure that government or private third-party payers will cover and reimburse the procedures using our products, in whole or in part, in the future, or that payment rates will be adequate. If providers cannot obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products, or the procedures in which they are used, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could suffer.\nWe could be subject to or otherwise affected by federal and state health care laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, and we could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such regulations.\nWe are directly or indirectly, through our customers, subject to extensive regulation by both the federal government and the states and foreign countries in which we conduct our business. If our past or present operations are found to be in violation of governmental laws or regulations to which we or our customers are subject, we could be subject to the applicable penalty associated with the violation, which could include civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from FHCPs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If we are required to obtain permits or licensure under these laws that we do not already possess, we could become subject to substantial additional regulation or incur significant expense. Any penalties, damages, fines, or curtailment or restructuring of our operations could be significant. The risk of potential non-compliance is increased by the fact that many of these laws have not been fully interpreted by applicable regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations and additional legal or regulatory change. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, damage our reputation, and cause a material adverse effect on sales, cash collections, and our ability to meet operating cash flow requirements.\nWe could be exposed to liabilities under the FCPA, and any determination that we violated the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn light of our operations outside the United States, we are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from offering to pay, promising to pay, or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign official in his/her capacity or to secure any other improper advantage to obtain or retain business. Violation of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA can result in criminal fines of up to $2 million and civil penalties of up to $16,000 for each violation. Individuals, including officers, directors, stockholders, and agents of companies, can be subject to a criminal fine of up to $250,000 and imprisonment, in addition to civil penalties of up to $16,000, per violation. We could be held liable for actions taken by our distributors in violation of the FCPA, even though such partners are foreign companies that may not be subject to the FCPA. Any determination that we violated the FCPA could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nProduct sales or introductions could be delayed or canceled as a result of the FDA regulatory requirements applicable to laser products, dental devices, or both, which could cause our sales or profitability to decline and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals and clearances to market a medical device from the FDA and similar regulatory authorities abroad can be costly and time-consuming, and we cannot provide assurance that such approvals and clearances will be granted. Pursuant to FDA regulations, unless exempt, the FDA permits commercial distribution of a new medical device only after the device has received 510(k) clearance or is the subject of an approved PMA. The FDA will clear marketing of a medical device through the 510(k) process if it is demonstrated that the new product is substantially equivalent to other 510(k)-cleared products. The PMA process is more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) process, and must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies, and human clinical trials. Because we cannot provide assurance that any new products, or any product enhancements, that we develop will be subject to the shorter 510(k) clearance process, significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancement could occur. We cannot provide assurance that the FDA will not require a new product or product enhancement to go through the lengthy and expensive PMA process. Delays in obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals could:\n\u2022\ndelay or eliminate commercialization of products we develop;\n\u2022\nrequire us to perform costly procedures;\n\u2022\ndiminish any competitive advantages that we may attain; and\n\u2022\nreduce our ability to collect revenues or royalties.\nAlthough we have obtained 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market our dental laser systems, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be required to obtain new clearances or approvals for modifications or improvements to our products.\nOur products are subject to recalls and other regulatory actions after receiving FDA clearance or approval.\nThe FDA and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. A government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, or design defects, including defects in labeling. Any recall would divert management\u2019s attention and financial resources and harm our reputation with customers. Any recall involving our laser systems would be particularly harmful to us, because our laser systems comprise such an important part of our portfolio of products. However, any recall could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nFailure to meet NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements could result in the delisting of our common stock, negatively impact the price of our common stock and negatively impact our ability to raise additional capital.\nWe have received deficiency letters from NASDAQ in the past. For example, on December 3, 2019, we received a deficiency letter from NASDAQ\u2019s Listing Qualifications Department (the \u201cStaff\u201d), notifying us that we violated the continued listing requirements of NASDAQ listing rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cMinimum Bid Price Rule\u201d), which requires that BIOLASE common stock maintain a minimum bid price of at least $1.00 per share, and on March 31, 2020, we received a deficiency letter from NASDAQ notifying us that, based on the Company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity of $377,000 as of December 31, 2019, as reported in the 2019 Form 10-K, we were no longer in compliance with the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirement for continued listing on NASDAQ under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), which requires listed companies to maintain stockholders\u2019 equity of at least $2.5 million.\nAs of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, we are in compliance with both NASDAQ listing rule 5550(a)(2) and 5550(b)(1). However, if, in the future, we fail to comply with NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements, our common stock will be subject to delisting. If that were to occur, our common stock would be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock. This would adversely affect the ability of investors to trade our common stock and would adversely affect the value of our common stock. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock. If we seek to implement a further reverse stock split in order to remain listed on NASDAQ, the announcement or implementation of such a reverse stock split could negatively affect the price of our common stock.\nOur stock price has been, and could continue to be, volatile.\nThere has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities, which may be unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities. These broad market fluctuations could negatively affect the market price of our stock. The market price and volume of our common stock could fluctuate, and in the past has fluctuated, more dramatically than the stock market in general. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the market price of our common stock has ranged from a high of $0.87 per share to a low of $0.23 per share. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them due to fluctuations in the market price of our stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects or other factors. Some factors, in addition to the other risk factors identified above, that could have a significant effect on our stock market price include but are not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects;\n\u2022\nour announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements of new products;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements, and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles;\n\u2022\nchanges in our growth rates or our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u2022\ndevelopments regarding our patents or proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nour inability to raise additional capital as needed;\n\u2022\nconcerns or allegations as to the safety or efficacy of our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial markets or general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nsales of stock by us or members of our management team, our Board, our significant stockholders, or certain institutional stockholders; and\n\u2022\nchanges in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally.\nYou could experience substantial dilution of your investment as a result of future sales of our equity, subsequent exercises of our outstanding warrants and options, or the future grant of equity by us.\nAs of the date of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, management is evaluating all options to conserve cash and to obtain additional debt or equity financing and/or enter into a collaborative arrangement or sale of assets, to permit the Company to continue operations. Moreover, we may choose to raise additional capital from time to time, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. During February 2021, we sold 14.0 million shares of our common stock in an underwritten bought deal offering for gross proceeds of approximately $14.4 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. During 2020, we consummated a registered direct offering of 10.8 million shares of BIOLASE common stock to certain accredited institutional investors and a concurrent private placement of warrants to purchase 10.8 million shares of BIOLASE common stock with an exercise price of $0.515 per share. We received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $6.9 million in the offering, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. Also in 2020, we completed a registered rights offering under which we sold an aggregate of 18,000 units consisting of an aggregate of 18,000 shares of Series F Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries F Preferred Stock\u201d) and warrants to purchase 45 million shares of BIOLASE common stock, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $15.8 million after deducting expenses relating to the rights offering.\nDuring 2019, we consummated an underwritten public offering of approximately 9.0 million shares of BIOLASE common stock and a private placement of 69,565 shares of our Series E Preferred Stock, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $7.8 million after deducting underwriter discounts and other fees and expenses. During 2017, we sold approximately 6.9 million shares of common stock in a rights offering and private placement with gross proceeds totaling approximately $22.5 million. During 2016, we sold approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock in private placements with gross proceeds totaling approximately $10.0 million. During 2014, we sold approximately 4.5 million shares of common stock in private placements with gross proceeds totaling approximately $52.0 million. To the extent that we raise additional funds through the future sale of equity or convertible securities, the issuance of such securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by investors in the offering. Investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders.\nIn addition, you could experience substantial dilution of your investment as a result of subsequent exercises of outstanding warrants and outstanding options and vesting of restricted stock units issued as compensation for services performed by employees, directors, consultants, and others, warrants issued in past sales of our equity, or the grant of future equity-based awards. As of December 31, 2020, an aggregate of 4,746,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans, 2,658,000 of which were subject to options outstanding as of that date at a weighted-average exercise price of $3.30 per share and 4,622,000 of which were subject to restricted stock units outstanding or expected to be issued under our leadership bonus program as of that date. Of the 7,281,000 stock options and restricted stock units outstanding, 2,268,000 stock options were vested and exercisable. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, 54,085,000 shares of our common stock were subject to warrants at a weighted-average exercise price of $0.62 per share and 500,000 shares were expected to be issued under our restricted stock agreement with CAO Group, Inc. (\u201cCAO\u201d), relating to the Confidential Settlement Agreement, dated January 25, 2019, by and between BIOLASE and CAO. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, the 882 shares of Series F Preferred Stock are convertible into 2,205,000 shares of our common stock if converted. To the extent that outstanding warrants or options are exercised or the convertible preferred stock is converted, our existing stockholders could experience dilution. We rely heavily on equity awards to motivate current employees and to attract new employees. The grant of future equity awards by us to our employees and other service providers could further dilute our stockholders\u2019 interests in the Company.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends, our stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders purchased their shares.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. There can be no assurance that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of the Company or fail to regularly publish reports on the Company, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 78071, "SIC": 3843, "TIC": "BIOL"}
