{"cik": "1048911", "company": "FEDEX CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-07-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cRisk Factors\u201d), the express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macro-economic growth. The ability to compete effectively depends upon price, frequency, capacity and speed of scheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of geographic coverage, reliability and innovative service offerings.\nCompetitors within the U.S. include other package delivery concerns, principally United Parcel Service, Inc. (\u201cUPS\u201d), passenger airlines offering express package services, regional delivery concerns, air freight forwarders and the USPS. FedEx Express\u2019s principal international competitors are DHL, UPS, TNT Express, foreign postal authorities, freight forwarders, passenger airlines and all-cargo airlines. Many of FedEx Express\u2019s international competitors are government-owned, -controlled or -subsidized carriers, which may have greater resources, lower costs, less profit sensitivity and more favorable operating conditions than FedEx Express.\nEmployees\nDavid J. Bronczek is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Express, which is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. As of May 31, 2015, FedEx Express employed approximately 114,000 permanent full-time and approximately 52,000 permanent part-time employees, of which 13% are employed in the Memphis area. FedEx Express\u2019s international employees represent 37% of all employees.\nThe pilots of FedEx Express, who constitute a small percentage of our total employees, are represented by the Air Line Pilots\n- 12 -\nAssociation, International (\u201cALPA\u201d), and are employed under a collective bargaining agreement. This agreement became amendable in March 2013, and the parties are currently in negotiations. In October 2014, FedEx Express formally requested assistance from the National Mediation Board (\u201cNMB\u201d) to mediate the negotiations and the NMB has been actively mediating the talks since that time. The NMB is the U.S. governmental agency that oversees labor agreements for entities covered by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended (the \u201cRLA\u201d). The conduct of mediated negotiations has no impact on our operations.\nAttempts by other labor organizations to organize certain other groups of FedEx Express employees occur from time to time. Although these organizing attempts have not resulted in any certification of a U.S. domestic collective bargaining representative of FedEx Express employees (other than ALPA), we cannot predict the outcome of these labor activities or their effect, if any, on FedEx Express or its employees. Certain of FedEx Express\u2019s non-U.S. employees are unionized. FedEx Express believes its employee relations are excellent.\nFedEx Trade Networks\nFedEx Trade Networks provides international trade services, specializing in customs brokerage and global ocean and air freight forwarding. Specifically, FedEx Trade Networks provides international trade advisory services, including assistance with the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (\u201cC-TPAT\u201d) program, and through its WorldTariff subsidiary, publishes customs duty and tax information for over 180 customs areas worldwide. Additionally, FedEx Trade Networks provides customs clearance services for FedEx Express at its major U.S. hub facilities.\nAs trade throughout the world grows, so does the FedEx Trade Networks solutions portfolio. Value-added services of FedEx Trade Networks include 128 freight forwarding offices in 26 countries and Global Trade Data, an information tool that allows customers to track and manage imports. In addition, in 2015, FedEx Trade Networks strengthened its Latin America trade lane services with enhanced shipping options to meet customer demand. The trade lanes include the following routes: Germany to Mexico, Germany to Brazil, Hong Kong to Mexico and U.S. to Mexico.\nFedEx Trade Networks has approximately 5,000 employees and 150 offices in 128 service locations throughout North America and in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, India, Latin America and the Middle East. FedEx Trade Networks maintains a network of air and ocean freight-forwarding service providers and has entered into strategic alliances to provide services in certain countries in which it does not have owned offices.\nFedEx SupplyChain Systems\nFedEx SupplyChain is an integrated logistics provider offering a range of supply chain solutions that leverage FedEx information technology and transportation networks around the world. The company offers services that include critical inventory logistics, transportation management and temperature-controlled transportation through a network of owned and managed resources - all tightly integrated via advanced information technology systems. FedEx SupplyChain also offers expanded visibility and control features, as well as forward stocking locations to support worldwide FedEx Critical Inventory Logistics customers with high-value, critical orders.\nBongo\nIn December 2014, we acquired Bongo, a leader in cross-border enablement technologies and solutions. Bongo\u2019s capabilities complement and expand the FedEx portfolio of offerings important to international e-commerce. Bongo\u2019s technology and processes provide a comprehensive and integrated end-to-end solution that helps retailers and e-tailers grow by reaching international e-commerce consumers. Bongo\u2019s capabilities include export compliance management, Harmonized System classification, currency conversions,\n- 13 -\ninternational payment options inclusive of language translation, shopping cart management, duty and tax calculations and credit card fraud protection. Bongo is headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida, and is a subsidiary of FedEx Trade Networks.\nFedEx Ground Segment\nFedEx Ground\nOverview\nBy leveraging the FedEx brand, maintaining a low cost structure and efficiently using information technology and advanced automation systems, FedEx Ground continues to enhance its competitive position as a leading provider of business and residential money-back guaranteed ground package delivery services. FedEx Ground serves customers in the North American small-package market, focusing on business and residential delivery of packages weighing up to 150 pounds. Ground service is provided to 100% of the continental U.S. population and overnight service of up to 400 miles to nearly 100% of the continental U.S. population. Service is also provided to nearly 100% of the Canadian population. In addition, FedEx Ground offers service to Alaska and Hawaii through a ground and air network operation coordinated with other transportation providers.\nFedEx Ground continues to improve the speed, reach and service capabilities of its network, by reducing transit time for many of its lanes and introducing or expanding overnight ground service in many metropolitan areas. FedEx Ground\u2019s ongoing network expansion program is substantially increasing the company\u2019s daily pickup capacity through the addition of new hubs featuring the latest automated sorting technology, the expansion of existing hubs and the expansion or relocation of other existing facilities.\nThe company offers our FedEx Home Delivery service, which reaches nearly 100% of U.S. residences. FedEx Home Delivery is dedicated to meeting the delivery needs of residential customers and provides routine Saturday and evening delivery and premium options such as day-specific, appointment and signature delivery. FedEx Home Delivery brings unmatched services to residential shippers and their customers and is the first residential ground package delivery service to have offered a money-back guarantee.\nAdditionally, FedEx Delivery Manager allows our U.S. residential customers to customize home deliveries to fit their schedule by providing a range of options to schedule dates, locations and times of delivery. By signing up at fedex.com, customers can receive notification of FedEx Ground packages en route to their homes and can choose various delivery options.\nPricing\nFedEx Ground periodically publishes list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guide. In general, U.S. shipping rates are based on the service selected, destination zone, weight, size, any ancillary service charge and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. As previously announced, on January 5, 2015, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery average list prices increased 4.9%.\nIn addition, as announced in May 2014, FedEx Ground began applying dimensional weight pricing to all shipments effective January 5, 2015. Previously, FedEx Ground applied dimensional weight pricing only to packages measuring three cubic feet or greater. Dimensional weight pricing is a common industry practice that sets the transportation price based on package volume - the amount of space a package occupies in relation to its actual weight.\n- 14 -\nFedEx Ground has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is subject to a monthly adjustment. The surcharge percentage is based on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel as published monthly by the U.S. Department of Energy. For example, the fuel surcharge for May 2015 was based on the average diesel fuel price published for March 2015. Changes to the FedEx Ground fuel surcharge, when calculated according to the rounded index average and FedEx Ground trigger points, are applied effective from the first Monday of the month. These trigger points may change from time to time, but information on the fuel surcharge for each month is available at fedex.com approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable. On February 2, 2015, we updated the tables used to determine the fuel surcharges at FedEx Ground. See the \u201cFuel\u201d section of Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d) for a description and discussion of the net impact of fuel on our operating results.\nOperations\nFedEx Ground operates a multiple hub-and-spoke sorting and distribution system consisting of 547 facilities, including 33 hubs, in the U.S. and Canada. FedEx Ground conducts its operations primarily with approximately 47,000 owner-operated vehicles and approximately 48,000 company-owned trailers. To provide FedEx Home Delivery service, FedEx Ground leverages its existing pickup operation and hub and linehaul network. FedEx Home Delivery\u2019s operations are often co-located with existing FedEx Ground facilities to achieve further cost efficiencies.\nAdvanced automated sorting technology is used to streamline the handling of millions of packages daily. Using overhead laser and six-sided camera-based bar code scan technology, hub conveyors electronically guide packages to their appropriate destination chute, where they are loaded for transport to their respective destination terminals for local delivery. Software systems and Internet-based applications are also deployed to offer customers new ways to connect internal package data with external delivery information. FedEx Ground provides shipment tracing and proof-of-delivery signature functionality through the FedEx website, fedex.com. For additional information regarding FedEx Ground e-shipping tools and solutions, see \u201cFedEx Services - Customer-Driven Technology.\u201d\nFedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Ground shipping services at all of its U.S. and Canadian retail locations. FedEx Ground is also available as a service option at many FedEx Authorized ShipCenters in the U.S.\nAs of May 31, 2015, FedEx Ground had approximately 62,000 employees. In addition, FedEx Ground relies on independent small businesses to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, as the use of independent contractors is well suited to the needs of the ground delivery business and its customers. Henry J. Maier is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Ground. FedEx Ground is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and its primary competitors are UPS, the USPS and regional delivery carriers.\nIndependent Contractor Model\nAlthough FedEx Ground is involved in numerous lawsuits and other proceedings (such as state tax or other administrative challenges) where the classification of its independent contractors is at issue, the company believes its relationship with its contractors is generally excellent. For a description of these proceedings, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cRisk Factors\u201d) and Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nFedEx Ground has made changes to its relationships with the small businesses it contracts with that, among other things, provide incentives for improved service and enhanced regulatory and other compliance by the contractors. For example, FedEx Ground has implemented its Independent Service Provider (\u201cISP\u201d) model in a number of states. The ISP model requires pickup-and-delivery contractors based in those states to, among other things: (i) assume responsibility for the pickup-and-delivery operations of an entire\n- 15 -\ngeographic service area that includes multiple routes, and (ii) negotiate independent agreements with FedEx Ground, rather than agree to a standard contract. To date, FedEx Ground has transitioned to the ISP model in 17 states and is in the process of transitioning to the model in four additional states. Depending on a number of considerations, FedEx Ground may transition to it in other states as well.\nIn addition, because of state-specific legal and regulatory issues, FedEx Ground only contracts with businesses that (i) are organized as corporations registered and in good standing under applicable state law, and (ii) ensure that their personnel who provide services under an operating agreement with FedEx Ground are treated as their employees. FedEx Ground also has an ongoing nationwide program to incentivize owners who choose to grow their businesses by adding routes. During May 2015, approximately 93% of FedEx Ground\u2019s package volume was delivered by business owners operating multiple routes.\nFedEx SmartPost\nFedEx SmartPost (a subsidiary of FedEx Ground) is a leading national small-parcel consolidator, which specializes in the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages, using the USPS for final delivery to residences. The company picks up shipments from customers (including e-tailers and catalog companies), provides sorting and linehaul services and then delivers the packages to a USPS facility for final delivery by a postal carrier. Through its network of 27 distribution hubs and approximately 9,000 employees, FedEx SmartPost provides delivery to all residential addresses in the U.S., including PO Boxes and military destinations.\nOn March 16, 2015, we announced that our FedEx SmartPost business will be merged into FedEx Ground effective September 1, 2015. The FedEx SmartPost service remains an important component of our service offerings and this internal structural change will enhance our ability to leverage the strengths of both the FedEx Ground and FedEx SmartPost networks to maximize operational efficiencies and will provide greater flexibility to meeting the needs of our e-commerce customers. There are no planned personnel reductions associated with this merger.\nGENCO\nOn January 30, 2015, we acquired GENCO, a leading North American third-party logistics provider. With a comprehensive portfolio of supply chain services, GENCO\u2019s expertise will expand existing FedEx service offerings in the evolving retail and e-commerce markets. GENCO\u2019s infrastructure and supply chain capabilities include reverse logistics, providing triage, test and repair, remarketing and product liquidation solutions. Additionally, GENCO\u2019s breadth of expertise in targeted vertical markets - such as technology, healthcare and retail - aligns with our strategic priorities in these areas. With more than 10,000 employees at approximately 150 facilities, GENCO offers a complete range of product lifecycle logistics\u00ae services to customers in the technology, consumer, industrial, retail, and healthcare markets. GENCO is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The financial results of this business are included in the FedEx Ground segment from the date of acquisition. GENCO has a small number of employees that are members of unions.\nFedEx Freight Segment\nFedEx Freight\nFedEx Freight is a leading U.S. provider of LTL freight services, offering choice, simplicity and reliability to meet the needs of LTL shippers - FedEx Freight Priority, when speed is critical to meet supply chain needs, and FedEx Freight Economy, when time can be\n- 16 -\ntraded for cost savings. Through one comprehensive network of service centers and advanced information systems, FedEx Freight provides service to virtually every U.S. ZIP Code (including Alaska and Hawaii) with industry-leading transit times. FedEx Freight Priority, which has the fastest published transit times of any nationwide LTL service, offers a no-fee money-back guarantee on eligible shipments. Internationally, FedEx Freight Canada offers FedEx Freight Priority service, serving most points in Canada, as well as FedEx Freight Priority and FedEx Freight Economy service between Canada and the U.S. In addition, FedEx Freight serves Mexico, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands via alliances.\nThrough its many service offerings, FedEx Freight can match customers\u2019 time-critical needs with industry leading transit times. With the expansion of FedEx electronic solutions, LTL shippers have the convenience of a single shipping and tracking solution for FedEx Freight, FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. These solutions make freight shipping easier and provide customers easy access to their account information. The FedEx Freight Advance Notice feature available on FedEx Freight Priority shipments uses the company\u2019s innovative technology systems to proactively notify FedEx Freight customers via the Internet, e-mail or fax when a shipment may be delayed beyond its estimated delivery date, providing customers with greater visibility and control of their LTL freight shipments. Customers can also process cross-border LTL shipments to and from Canada and Mexico, as well as intra-Canada and -Mexico shipments, through FedEx Ship Manager at fedex.com, FedEx Ship Manager Software, FedEx Ship Manager Server and FedEx Web Services. Additionally, FedEx Freight A.M. Delivery offers freight delivery by 10:30 a.m. within and between the U.S. and Canada, backed by a money-back guarantee.\nFedEx Freight has an indexed fuel surcharge that applies to certain LTL shipments, which is subject to weekly adjustment based on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel. On February 2, 2015, we updated the tables used to determine FedEx Freight fuel surcharges. As previously announced, on January 5, 2015, FedEx Freight implemented a 4.9% average increase in certain U.S. and other shipping rates.\nAs of May 31, 2015, the FedEx Freight segment was operating approximately 65,000 vehicles and trailers from a network of approximately 370 service centers and had approximately 40,000 employees. Michael L. Ducker is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Freight, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee. FedEx Freight\u2019s primary competitors are YRC Worldwide Inc. (which includes YRC Regional Transportation and YRC Freight), Con-way Freight (a subsidiary of Con-way Inc.), UPS Freight, Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. and ABF Freight (a subsidiary of ArcBest Corporation).\nIn 2015, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (\u201cTeamsters\u201d) petitioned for Labor Board elections at sixteen FedEx Freight facilities. The Teamsters lost the vote or withdrew the petition prior to the election at twelve facilities and won the vote at four facilities. With respect to the elections that the Teamsters won, there are three appeals pending and FedEx Freight is considering whether to appeal the other election.\nFedEx Custom Critical\nFedEx Custom Critical provides a range of expedited, time-specific freight-shipping services throughout the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Among its services are Surface Expedite, for exclusive-use and network-based transport of critical shipments and expedited shipments; Air Expedite, which offers an array of air solutions to meet customers\u2019 critical delivery times; White Glove Services, for shipments that require extra care in handling, temperature control or specialized security; and ShipmentWatch, an offering through which FedEx Custom Critical manages SenseAware\u00ae devices to track customers\u2019 shipments - by programming the device to the customer\u2019s requirements prior to the shipment, sending the device to the shipper and then proactively monitoring the shipment from pickup to delivery. Service from FedEx Custom Critical is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. In addition, its subsidiary FedEx Truckload Brokerage provides freight brokerage solutions within the U.S. and into and out of Canada and Mexico. FedEx Custom\n- 17 -\nCritical continuously monitors shipments through an integrated proprietary shipment-control system, including two-way satellite communications on exclusive-use shipments.\nFedEx Services Segment\nFedEx Services\nFedEx Services provides our other companies with sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer service and certain other back-office support. Through FedEx Services and its subsidiary FedEx TechConnect, we provide a convenient single point of access for many customer support functions, enabling us to more effectively sell the entire portfolio of transportation services and to help ensure a consistent and outstanding experience for our customers.\nT. Michael Glenn is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Services, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee. As of May 31, 2015, the FedEx Services segment had approximately 30,000 employees (including approximately 15,000 at FedEx Office).\nCustomer-Driven Technology\nFedEx is a world leader in technology, and FedEx founder Frederick W. Smith\u2019s vision that \u201cthe information about a package is as important as the delivery of the package itself\u201d remains at the core of our comprehensive technology strategy. In fact, FedEx ranked No. 6 overall on the 2015 InformationWeek Elite 100 list - a compilation of the top business technology innovators in the U.S.\nOur technology strategy is driven by our desire for customer satisfaction. We strive to build technology solutions that will solve our customers\u2019 business problems with simplicity, convenience, speed and reliability. The focal point of our strategy is our award-winning website, together with our customer integrated solutions.\nThe fedex.com website was launched nearly 20 years ago, and during that time, customers have shipped and tracked billions of packages at fedex.com. The fedex.com website is widely recognized for its speed, ease of use and customer-focused features. At fedex.com, our customers ship packages, determine international documentation requirements, track package status, pay invoices and access FedEx Office services. The advanced tracking capability within FedEx Tracking provides customers with a consolidated view of inbound and outbound shipments.\nFedEx Mobile is a suite of services available on most web-enabled mobile devices, such as the BlackBerry\u00ae and Android\u2122 smartphones, and includes enhanced support for Apple products, such as the iPhone\u00ae, iPod touch\u00ae and iPad\u00ae devices. The FedEx Mobile website has expanded to more than 220 countries and territories and 26 languages. FedEx Mobile allows customers to track the status of packages, create shipping labels, get account-specific rate quotes and access drop-off location information. FedEx Office has its own iPhone\u00ae, iPad\u00ae and Android\u2122 apps that allow customers to print directly from their devices to any FedEx Office location in the U.S. or have the order delivered right to their door, while also allowing customers to get account-specific pricing, track print orders or packages, or find the nearest FedEx Office location. FedEx Office self-serve printers give customers even more flexibility by allowing direct USB access to print documents, as well as the ability to retrieve and print documents from customers\u2019 cloud accounts. FedEx also uses wireless data collection devices to scan bar codes on shipments, thereby enhancing and accelerating the package information available to our customers.\n- 18 -\nFedEx continues to provide customers with innovative solutions. For example, in May 2014 FedEx TechConnect opened a package laboratory providing FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight customers with free package testing and design services.\nWe design our e-commerce tools and solutions to be easily integrated into our customers\u2019 applications, as well as into third-party software developed by leading e-procurement, systems integration and enterprise resource planning companies. Our FedEx Ship Manager suite of solutions offers a wide range of options to help our customers manage their parcel and LTL shipping and associated processes.\nMarketing\nThe FedEx brand name is symbolic of outstanding service, reliability and speed. Emphasis is placed on promoting and protecting the FedEx brand, one of our most important assets. As a result, FedEx is one of the most widely recognized brands in the world. In addition to television, print and digital advertising, we promote the FedEx brand through corporate sponsorships and special events. For example, FedEx sponsors:\n\u2022\nPGA TOUR and the Champions Tour golf organizations, as the \u201cOfficial Shipping Company,\u201d and FedExCup, a season-long points competition for PGA TOUR players\n\u2022\nThe Title sponsor of the FedEx St. Jude Classic, a PGA TOUR event that raises millions of dollars for St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital\n\u2022\nThe National Football League (NFL), as its \u201cOfficial Delivery Service Sponsor\u201d and \u201cOfficial Office Services Provider of the NFL\u201d\n\u2022\nFedExField in Washington, DC\n\u2022\nThe #11 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota Camry driven by Denny Hamlin in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series\n\u2022\nATP World Tour men\u2019s professional tennis circuit and French Open tennis tournament\n\u2022\nFedExForum in Memphis, TN\nInformation Security\nFedEx Services has a team of highly qualified professionals dedicated to securing information about our customers\u2019 shipments and protecting our customers\u2019, vendors\u2019 and employees\u2019 privacy, and we strive to provide a safe, secure online environment for our customers. We are committed to compliance with applicable information security laws, regulations and industry standards - including, for example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, a set of comprehensive requirements for enhancing payment account data security developed by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. For a description of risks related to information security, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cRisk Factors\u201d).\nGlobal ISO 9001 Certification\nFedEx Services provides our customers with a high level of service quality, as evidenced by our ISO 9001 certification for our global express and ground operations. ISO 9001 registration is required by thousands of customers around the world. FedEx\u2019s global certification, encompassing the processes of FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Services, enhances our single-point-of-access strategy and solidifies our reputation as the quality leader in the transportation industry. ISO 9001 is currently the most rigorous international standard for Quality Management and Assurance. ISO standards were developed by the International Organization for\n- 19 -\nStandardization in Geneva, Switzerland to promote and facilitate international trade. More than 150 countries, including European Union members, the U.S. and Japan, recognize ISO standards.\nFedEx Office\nFedEx Office\u2019s network of digitally-connected locations offers access to copying and digital printing through retail and web-based platforms, signs and graphics, professional finishing, computer rentals, and the full range of FedEx day-definite ground shipping and time-definite global express shipping services. FedEx Office\u2019s network of locations provides convenient access points to FedEx Express and FedEx Ground services for higher margin retail customers. Customers may also have their FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery packages delivered to any FedEx Office location nationwide by choosing the \u201cHold at FedEx Location\u201d option when initiating a shipment - or even when a shipment is on its way - free of charge. In addition, in 2014 FedEx Office introduced the FedEx Ship&Get\u00ae pilot program, which is a shipping and delivery option available at select retail locations that allows customers to use stand-alone kiosks and lockers that are managed electronically to ship or pick up packages at their convenience.\nIn addition, FedEx Office offers packing services, and packing supplies and boxes are included in its retail offerings. By allowing customers to have items professionally packed by specially trained FedEx Office team members and then shipped using FedEx Ground day-definite shipping and time-definite global FedEx Express shipping services, FedEx Office offers a complete \u201cpack-and-ship\u201d solution. In November 2014, FedEx Office rolled out a new packing feature, Pack Plus, which expanded FedEx Office\u2019s packing and shipping capabilities. FedEx Pack Plus offerings include new custom box building capabilities and techniques, a more robust assortment of specialty boxes and additional packing supplies, equipment and tools to serve our customers\u2019 needs.\nAlmost all FedEx Office locations provide local pickup-and-delivery service for print jobs completed by FedEx Office. A FedEx courier picks up a customer\u2019s print job at the customer\u2019s location and then returns the finished product to the customer. Options and services vary by location. Additionally, through cloud printing with FedEx Office Print Online, customers can upload files from some of the most popular cloud websites including Box, Dropbox and Google Drive\u2122 and then select from a variety of printing options. Customers can choose to pick up their completed order at FedEx Office locations nationwide or have the order delivered right to their door. Customers also have the ability to access these same cloud files through a USB drive or mobile device at self-serve copiers in FedEx Office locations, giving them seamless access to their files across our online and retail channels. Lastly, FedEx SameDay City service is offered in more than 20 markets across the U.S., which allows customers to get their packages across town on the same day with local delivery by FedEx Office uniformed team members in branded FedEx Office delivery vehicles.\nAs of May 31, 2015, FedEx Office operated approximately 1,800 customer facing centers, including 25 locations in Canada, as well as 31 closed production centers. FedEx Office is headquartered in Dallas, Texas.\nTrademarks\nThe \u201cFedEx\u201d trademark, service mark and trade name is essential to our worldwide business. FedEx, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Office, FedEx Services, FedEx SupplyChain, FedEx TechConnect, FedEx Trade Networks, FedEx SmartPost and FedEx Custom Critical, among others, are trademarks, service marks and trade names of Federal Express Corporation, or the respective companies, for which registrations, or applications for registration, are on file, as applicable. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks and trade names by our contractors and Global Service Participants to support our business. In addition, we license the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks and trade names on promotional items for the primary purpose of enhancing brand awareness.\n- 20 -\nRegulation\nAir. Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, both the U.S. Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) and the Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d) exercise regulatory authority over FedEx Express.\nThe FAA\u2019s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation, including aircraft standards and maintenance, as well as personnel and ground facilities, which may from time to time affect the ability of FedEx Express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner. FedEx Express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the FAA pursuant to Part 119 of the federal aviation regulations. This certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as FedEx Express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations.\nIn September 2010, the FAA proposed rules that would significantly reduce the maximum number of hours on duty and increase the minimum amount of rest time for our pilots, and thus require us to hire additional pilots and modify certain of our aircraft. When the FAA issued final regulations in December 2011, all-cargo carriers, including FedEx Express, were exempt from these new pilot fatigue requirements, and instead required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules. In December 2012, the FAA reaffirmed the exclusion of us from the new rule. It is reasonably possible, however, that future security or flight safety requirements could impose material costs on us.\nThe DOT\u2019s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation. The DOT\u2019s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters, including the transfer of route authority between carriers. FedEx Express holds various certificates issued by the DOT, authorizing FedEx Express to engage in U.S. and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis.\nUnder the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security Administration (\u201cTSA\u201d), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility for aviation security. The TSA requires FedEx Express to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. These requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us.\nFedEx Express participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (\u201cCRAF\u201d) program. Under this program, the U.S. Department of Defense may requisition for military use certain of FedEx Express\u2019s wide-bodied aircraft in the event of a declared need, including a national emergency. FedEx Express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the CRAF program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts. Through its participation in the CRAF program, FedEx Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business. FedEx Express, together with a consortium of other carriers, currently contracts with the U.S. government for such charter flights.\nGround. The ground transportation performed by FedEx Express is integral to its air transportation services. The enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates, routes or services of intermodal all-cargo air carriers and most motor carriers. States may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance. FedEx Express is registered in those states that require registration.\n- 21 -\nThe operations of FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight and FedEx Custom Critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the DOT and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers. Federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation.\nLike other interstate motor carriers, our operations, including those at FedEx Express, are subject to certain DOT safety requirements governing interstate operations. In addition, vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations.\nInternational. FedEx Express\u2019s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its U.S. route system to numerous points throughout the world. The DOT regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. The right of a U.S. carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the DOT\u2019s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and the foreign government. In addition, the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services. The regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of FedEx Express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner. Additionally, global air cargo carriers, such as FedEx Express, are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by foreign governments.\nOur operations outside of the U.S., such as FedEx Express\u2019s growing international domestic operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations, including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements, that restrict, make difficult and sometimes prohibit, the ability of foreign-owned companies such as FedEx Express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market.\nCommunication. Because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations, FedEx Express is subject to the Federal Communications Commission Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission regulates and licenses FedEx Express\u2019s activities pertaining to satellite communications.\nEnvironmental. Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d), is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise. FedEx Express\u2019s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations. In addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise, certain airport operators have local noise regulations, which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day. These regulations have had a restrictive effect on FedEx Express\u2019s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of FedEx Express\u2019s significant markets. Congress\u2019s passage of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 established a National Noise Policy, which enabled FedEx Express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints. FedEx Express\u2019s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates.\nConcern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions, including our aircraft and diesel engine emissions. For example, in 2015, the EPA issued a proposed finding on GHG emissions from aircraft and its relationships to air pollution. The final finding is a regulatory prerequisite to the EPA\u2019s adoption of a new certification standard for aircraft emissions. Additionally, in 2009, the European Commission approved the extension of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (\u201cETS\u201d) for GHG emissions, to the airline industry. Under this decision, all FedEx Express flights that are wholly within the European Union are now covered by the ETS requirements, and each year we are required to submit emission allowances in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights. For a description of such efforts and their potential effect on our cost structure and operating results, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cRisk Factors\u201d).\n- 22 -\nWe are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the shipment of dangerous goods, contingency planning for spills of petroleum products, the disposal of waste oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in FedEx Office\u2019s copy machines. Additionally, we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks, hazardous waste handling, vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment. We have environmental management programs to ensure compliance with these regulations.\nCustoms. Our activities, including customs brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to regulation by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the TSA within the Department of Homeland Security (customs brokerage and security issues), the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (ocean freight forwarding) and the DOT (air freight forwarding). Our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions.\nLabor. All U.S. employees at FedEx Express are covered by the RLA, while labor relations within the U.S. at our other companies are governed by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, as amended (the \u201cNLRA\u201d). Under the RLA, groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees. The RLA also requires mandatory government-led mediation of contract disputes supervised by the NMB before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms. This part of the RLA helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy. Under the NLRA, employees can unionize in small localized groups, and government-led mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process.\nThe RLA was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations. As transportation systems evolved, the law expanded to cover airlines, which are the dominant national transportation systems of today. As an air express carrier with an integrated air/ground network, FedEx Express and its employees have been covered by the RLA since the founding of the company in 1971. The purpose of the RLA is to offer employees a process by which to unionize (if they choose) and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays. Specifically, the RLA ensures that an entire transportation system, such as at FedEx Express, cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network.\nThe U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees. For example, there is always a possibility that Congress could remove most FedEx Express employees from the jurisdiction of the RLA, thereby exposing the FedEx Express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire air/ground network. In addition, federal and state governmental agencies have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees to organize under the RLA or NLRA. For a description of these potential labor law changes, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cRisk Factors\u201d).\nITEM 1A.
